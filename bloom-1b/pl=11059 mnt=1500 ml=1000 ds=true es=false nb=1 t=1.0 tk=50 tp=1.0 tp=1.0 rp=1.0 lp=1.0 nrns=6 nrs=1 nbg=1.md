### Chapter Thirty Six
## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the golden age of fashion may well have started with one man named Charu Balenciaga. (Did you know that Balenciaga is the last owner of the company? If you didn't, this is your chance to learn about it.) As we have all grown up, we have likely seen a small collection of Balenciagas clothes on the television or even seen them on the runway in some fashion show - but do you really know where the man who was so cool in one of his most famous designs came from? Would you believe it was from Spain?

Unfortunately, no real clues to that time frame are known. Balenciaga may have started manufacturing in Spain in the 1930s but it was only during the Gold Rush (and the Great Depression) of the 1960s that it caught popularity - and it was on the heels of his own life's dramatic success that there would be such a fan base for a designer! (This has also led to the rumor that after he retired from business, he was taken by Elvis Presley to America to appear at his concert and ended up being the only living original Star of his era!)

So what's so bizarre about this? Let's begin by looking at some statistics about the man himself. He had already sold more than 100 million pieces of clothing by the time of his death in 1970! (Unfortunately, there is no record of any actual fashion show involving him...but you'll have to wait for the next chapter!)
As one can see, Balenciaga was well known for his flamboyant silhouettes that created the signature Balenciaga jeans. He also made a lot of music, making a fortune as a recording artist, writing several songs for the music industry, and making a couple of films as well. What else did he do? Well, it turns out; he was also a very talented actor.

He played one of his best role in the 1955 film My Fair Lady - and this is where he really became famous! Unfortunately, most of the actors who played the movie only performed their very best, so there is no way to really get a sense of the actor or any of the characters as well.

So let's give a brief look at some of the other works Balenciaga created in his career - and how much they contributed to success - let's just do this by simply listing them one by one...

My Life (1959)

This is probably one of Balenciaga's most popular work - a film that starred him with Catherine Deneuve and Marcello Mastroiani in a romantic love story that featured an Italian/Spanish beauty...and the only story of all his work to have one woman who played a prominent role in it! And it's incredibly well handled and acted off by some great actors!

So it probably wasn't exactly a bad film, but what else is there? Well, it's a well-written, interesting story...but it has a few of its problems: the love story is overlong; the romance between the main characters is a little bit clich√© and shallow; and the storyline is in a more mature section than it should be!
The second problem here is the action that takes place. There are a number of good sequences here, but they are all over-shot, and they are not in their right place in the story. What else could be done to better convey what is not being told? As it is, the story is so convoluted that by the time you've read on, it feels like an over-cut!

So if we stop right at this point, we are left with a fairly strong question...are we happy with how our story actually turned out?

The way we found out about the fate of the universe just gave us plenty of possibilities...and in most cases it led to us being happier. So with that, we have at least a small window to ponder the next phase of the story...which we have also a small window for solving it. As it is, we may have a slight chance to end this story...
So we have three things in our hands...which we should be able to fix, and a small window for solving the other two questions for the three. So as it is, we are left with one final question that will make all five questions possible.

Question #1: Would the universe actually exist? If it existed, then it must be...it must be a...It must be a...
Let's take a quick look at these first questions, which will give us a little idea of the possible answers and how it would turn out to be a universe in which it is.

Then we have the conclusion, that the universe is not a...And then we have the possible conclusion in which the world is a...So, ultimately, our conclusion must be that...the universe is...
So that's that is the conclusion, or the conclusion.

So that's the final and final statement, which is the final conclusion, which is the conclusion - the conclusion, so that's that final and the conclusion.

Good!

So that's the final conclusion, which I was talking about in the section...is the final conclusion, which was saying that was the conclusion...and the conclusion was that was the conclusion, the conclusion of the world was the conclusion, and it's the conclusion of the conclusion.

So that's that's the end of this story, so this it's finally the end of the piece, the end of this piece. So that's the conclusion of that is the end of that.So that's the end of this episode, and so it ends, so this ends.

And so this is the end of this series, so that's also this end of this story is the end, so this is the end. So that this is the end of This is the last of this episode, then we're the beginning of a new episode, and we finally
Is the end of this episode.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the reason why we're reading this chapter is because the idea behind it is...it's a theory! Well, at the very least it was based on an earlier idea by Alan Turing - the creator of one of the first computers to ever be invented!

However, in this version of the theory people call 'Category Theory'...somewhere in the mid 80s! In the late 90ies, some of the most important minds in computer science started to make very good arguments to the contrary: In 1989, Alan Knuth published a paper in Computing Theory (the Journal of Computational Mathematics) titled "A Proposal for a New Theory of the Classification of Computability," the theory he called "Category Theory"! Basically, according to this theory, categories are the ultimate abstractions that describe computation and so they are in fact much more complicated than computers, and they're actually the highest possible level of computation!

The theory of Category Theory has generated a lot of controversy since, but over the course of the past couple of decades, we have seen the field come into a much better understanding of how computers and the category theory really work...and it's pretty exciting! Of course, there are still a lot of problems that need to be solved, like how to implement all the different computation possible for a single category! Also, the fact that the theory has been debated so many times is pretty scary...especially considering just how many people actually have tried to implement something using the theory! The only way to learn about these things is to actually understand what is happening...

Now that you have a good grasp of the concept of Category Theory and the reason behind it, it's time to explain all the little tricks and details in it! In general, Category Theory is built around the idea that categories are a way of describing computations in a very meaningful way. In other words, categories are really different objects than computers, especially because they are abstract mathematical tools to describe computation. They are the tools that make it possible to go beyond the limits of computation (see section 3 for more). Let's explore each of these details in greater depth...

Category Theory for Computation

The first thing to note about Category Theory is that it doesn't describe computation in a way that is directly observable, instead, the language categories are based on. In other words, all computations that you can think of are basically represented by a subset of categories. Let's say we have a collection of categories X, Y,...X k, Y... Y k...Y n where k < n. This is really the same thing as creating a matrix with a row being a computer, and then a column containing the computational process that a single computer is executing. But unlike the computer, there are no dimensions or coordinates. Every computation in our categories is just a path along the matrix and so we can see the behavior of every computer being executed. But, again...this is just what computers really do...they are not just computers, but they are computers moving around a matrix.
So now we get back to the first section - that where we talked about creation. Again, creating something, let's look at this second step: We start by choosing a basic mathematical material and then try to combine it with other elements.
Let's look at what happens with concrete entities! For example, let's consider a cube of sand...how would we create this object? As we can see, the very first step would be to choose a certain material, like sand or sand mixed with water...and then add in some type of element that would make it look like sand! Yes, the very first step is actually quite simple! The matter is completely created, and then added in some basic materials and then mixed in together...that's it!

Now we can go back to our previous scene and see that: it was in a box which we could create a lot of concrete elements as follows: sand mixed with water...that's it! Let's see how what comes out in this new product! Let us call it C 4. After doing this process, we have a large number of compounds called C 4 in which the concrete is formed. And finally, we get a few simple chemicals, that will do what is necessary to build the original structure that we're using in the previous example. As we will see, the composition of these materials are all in their proper place, and then they end up producing new composite objects (i.e., C 6, and then they end up creating composite objects. Once we construct all this process we end up with a really complicated system that is called Compound Chain Theory
Now lets consider what is the final step which is based on many sub-chains. But what we need to explain is that our building these molecules leads to that a compound is a combination of sub-computations to create the ultimate structure. In this is what we are creating the ultimate structure. Now we need that to be the main idea of how we could construct the final structure. Again, we just just repeat these steps and here is the structure of the final form! But when we look at that, what we are constructing the final stage, that is called the final structure from the previous structure that was formed by the previous stages. We have all finished the last step. Now look at the final structural structure of the entire construction.

It is basically a set of mathematical structures that is called the final structural structure in this way we can get the ultimate result.

Once we have reached our final, or we have our final structure, then the final structure that I have shown a set of fundamental that we know when the fundamental has completed, then we are finished. In this step we only have the total information that we are able to get the ultimate.
In order to construct a complete we will have a great number of structures. Now here you will have one number that is called the number of elements. In this we have a number of elements. Then, we have a total number of them. Then we have a total number that of of these elements. The number of elements has elements. Then we will have a list of the total number of elements that the number of elements.

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the reason we choose to use a couple of nipples as the reference point for the three other characters in this section is because they are exactly the size of the rest of their bodies! But it was a lot easier to make cute pictures of four different bodies when we had four nipples (which seems to be an uncommon property here, because we would want characters to have four different fingers!). In addition, they share the physical and aesthetic appearance and behavior of:

Chandler Bing - a single woman with two left in her body and one right on her chin (this is because when the characters grow up, one of their left hands will eventually grow up - they would be called Bill and the other would be called Robin, hence the name Bing)!
Charlie Chaplin - a single man with two left in his body (who will be called Charlie while he is in his teenaged years, and Robin will eventually grow up - he will have two hands on his left!!)
Marge Simpson - an eight year old girl with two right and four left in her body!
Mrs. Burns - a widow with six left in her body and two right! This is because she is in her mid-twenties and will eventually have an accident and her right hand will grow up!
Wendy - the wife of Charlie!
Lola - a six-year-old girl with two right and two left in her body (they will be called Lola and Mrs. Burns respectively).

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our knowledge of the fourth dimension, we can use the mathematical concepts of entailment and entailment-free explanations (for further details, see Chapter 26). In fact, those will make the difference between entailed and entailment-free explanation at the end of the day!

One of the theories behind the Fourth Dimension is that it has some sort of magical powers. In other words, it might be able to predict the future based on some kind of statistics. For example, the concept of Entschizismus means the concept of randomness, and it is one of several theories of randomness that we are currently learning about.

Now one of the major aspects people often forget about is that, even though the scientific world often focuses on predicting the future based on past data, humans tend to do a lot more than that. For example, during the World War II, scientists and engineers at the Department of Air Operations (DOA) studied how the German bombers had managed to launch their attack on the English defenses to gain control of the world and ultimately defeat Nazi Germany. And they discovered quite a bit!

For example, during the German attack on London during World War II, the entire British Army (roughly 600,000 people) suffered from mental breakdown, hallucinations, delusions, mental illnesses, and confusion. In short, the whole division of the Army, and its entire leadership experienced some sort of mental breakdown! And since this entire division suffered from such psychic problems due to their psychological conditioning in World War II, they were also predisposed to mental illness over the next 40+ years!

Now let's return back to our original 4D space-time particle, and imagine that the particles (the 4D physical universe itself) moved through our 3+1-dimensional space-time, which is where most of us (our reality) live. Each particle on this space-time trajectory would then see two very slightly overlapping 3D versions of themselves. Now imagine a particle that was moving across the space-time in our 3D universe (Dimension A) that had come from a Dimension A into Dimension B (where Dimension B is lower in dimension than its own dimensionality); that particle would experience two separate 3D versions (the two versions would move from the left of its 3d dimensionality to the right of its original dimensionality). This would be called the "entailment" process! Now imagine another particle moving across the space-time from Dimension B into Dimension C (the 4D physical space where we exist); this particle would see two separate 3D versions (one is moving from the right to the left of its own dimensionality; the other is moving from the right of its own dimensionality to the right). Now imagine that one particle is in the middle of Dimension C and the other is moving across the space-time between themselves (from their respective Dimensions), and their two 3D versions come from their respective dimensions (the physical space) and into Dimension D (where their 3D versions are located). Again, if we were at their original dimensionality, these 2 3D versions would move from their respective dimensions, and into Dimension D! Here, the Entailment process occurred, and a particle from Dimension G (the dimension of our own reality) and another particle from Dimension D were sent to Dimension E and another particle from Dimension G were sent to Dimension E, and another particle from Dimension E into Dimension G... And after this sequence of events, there would be a sequence of four space-like dimensions: 3D-1, 3D-1, 2-D-1, 1D-1, and 1-D-1 (the 4-dimensional spacetime). Here, the Entailing process continued, and after some long, and very long and very long and very very long and very long, and long and very very long, and very very long and and and... eventually, the EN ENENTENTENTENTENTENT, or/.../.. and..., I would be completely surrounded by a great many, many, many, many,... of, and, and, and, er, and and, er, and, and and, and, and... an extremely long, and very very very very very

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this entire chapter we will use mathematics as a primary medium to explain what is happening.  We will discuss basic concepts, how mathematical facts work, and how the concepts fit into larger systems. But first lets explore mathematics to understand why it is useful...

Basic Concepts of Mathematics

Let's review some basic concepts that are needed to understand how mathematics might be of any help to us on our path to understanding and experiencing reality...

Axioms

Every mathematical formulation must satisfy certain axioms - they make the statement understandable. If the axioms are violated, we won't be able to express the statement properly.

The Pythagorean Theorem

Let's explore some of the basic principles of geometry - that they are based upon mathematical ideas that can be used in solving a variety of problems, ranging from simple games to complex mathematical formulas and algorithms. Mathematicians call these principles Pythagorean, being inspired by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras.

Fundamental Operations

Let's explore a few fundamental mathematical operations (often used in a computer system) that are common to many different mathematically based applications.

Mathematical Functions

Let's explore some mathematical functions. Mathematicians call them functions because it is easier for people to work with numbers rather than figures. Let's explore some mathematical functions, starting with basic ones...

A Basic Maths Quiz

Let's look at a simple mathematical problem using the basic operations to find the answer.

The Squaring Problem

Let's take a simple math problem and try to solve it using the basic operations.
There are two possible answer patterns to work with and we need to choose one...

1. Number of Pi's: Pi squares are equal to
Pi + Pi + Pi + Pi
2. Pi: Pi is a power of two and multiplication is
P + P + P + P

So the solution to the square problem would be
Pi Pi Pi Pi Pi
To prove that Pi Pi Pi Pi Pi is correct, we need to make use of the Pythagorean Theorem and the fact that Pi Pi Pi is a power of 2.

The Square of Pi

If we wanted to square an infinite number of pi numbers, we would first need to perform the multiplication. But we also need to multiply Pi Pi Pi Pi Pi which results in 2 Pi Pi Pi Pi Pi Pi
So the solution to this square problem would be
We know that Pi Pi Pi Pi is a unit and we have to multiply Pi Pi Pi by Pi Pi Pi for Pi Pi Pi to get Pi Pi Pi
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we need to multiply Pi Pi to get PiPi PiPi Pi Pi
Using the equation shown above, we need to multiply P Pi Pi Pi to get P Pi Pi Pi PiPi
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that Pi Pi Pi is equal to Pi Pi PiPi and the inverse expression is Pi Pi PiPiPiPi = Pi Pi Pi PiPiPi Pi
There are only two possible solutions to the square problem, but they all give the same result, one is the first case and the second is the second case which is the correct answer! Can we calculate the different possible solutions to the square question? As stated in our previous question, the number of possible possible solutions is one; when there is a solution, we have a unique answer. So one solution exists! But if we only allow one answer, that answer is also the right answer!

But in this question the total number of possible answers are six. So there must be two ways to solve the question. 

2. Both solutions have the same answer, so we have one solution but they both have the same answer and hence we have multiple solutions
But how can we calculate two different answer solutions for the square question, given that there are only three possible answer solutions?

In the first solution there are three different solutions to
The first solution is to have two possible answer solutions. The first possibility results in two distinct answer solutions because one has two possible solution solutions (the second solution) but the third one is only one solution. If we take every possible solution, then there are only two possible solutions and they are the ones with the same answer. So the number of possible solutions is equal.
So the total number of possibilities for the square is three. This means that the total possible numbers of solutions for the square is six. If we solve the square, we only take two possible answer solutions: The first possible solution is to be P and the second, P and, so the total number of possibilities is six. Which gives the number of possible answers the total answer is 5 which gives the total answer is five.

There is only one answer, so there is only one answer.

But there is only one answer, and there is only one answer possible. So we have only one solution.

Because there is only one solution.

But there is only an only one answer which is which gives the total of total has only two possible solutions.

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what happens when people study mathematics - let us use an analogy (and a metaphor) that comes as almost no surprise: when people eat. When they eat, they have to eat large amounts of food in small amounts (because that is how small their stomachs naturally are)...but when they study mathematics, what they have to eat is vastly different!
Now imagine that you were a kid and you spent your entire life trying to keep up with your peers in school. Would you ever stop trying to do so? Of course not! What if we take the analogy a step further? Imagine that there was an entire universe of maths in which all the students in the world were playing the game of Scrabble! Would this be any easier for you...and for your friends?! Think about it...you'd be able to do something amazing if you had a lot of amazing skills!!!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this amazing fact, let us start at the beginning - Einstein's relativity theory of spacetime. Now, you might ask yourself: How can such a complex concept have anything to do with physics? Well, well...
Consider one of Einstein's famous equations - namely the Einstein equation (Eqs. 1-3 below):
$$\int_{t\to t_0}\frac{dt}{dt_0}\frac{\partial t}{\partial t}=\int_{t-\Deltat} dt -\int_{to_\Deltat} dt$$
Note that this equation describes a gravitational field, in this case an electromagnetic field. In fact, all other forces described by Einstein's theory, including all matter forces, as well as radiation and nuclear forces, are all field forces.
Einstein's theory of relativity explains how mass, energy, and time all interact together to affect our world. From what we're seeing now, gravitational fields are nothing but electromagnetic waves; matter is just field energy (a mass/energy field) that is emitted and absorbed by various objects (including the universe itself!) through certain geometrical patterns (known as spacetime patterns). The universe is comprised of four space-time dimensions (D=4)! We will return to this matter further in the future...
A quick takeaway from above is that gravity is based on field energy, a form of mass/energy. All gravitational field forces that are caused by matter objects (or matter fields), including all of these forces and even radiation and nuclear forces are all field forces too. The other forms of forces (the electromagnetic field, or photons, gravitational attraction, and inertia) are all based on particle-like energy properties. They all occur at the local or global level but are not directly seen by our physical senses (as such, we only see particles).
So gravitational fields are electromagnetic fields, because there are massive particles that are carrying them. A big question here will be: What if we're looking at matter fields and particles rather than photons? Well, according to Einstein's theory of relativities, these particles are all electromagnetic waves rather than matter particles! The matter in these fields is just a form of material that has electric charge and magnetic fields, meaning it's a composite of matter! But because these fields are emitted and absorbed by matter (physical, quantum and quantum), these fields themselves experience a gravitational field...and we can view the universe through a gravitational lens!

Now, what about this? Well...if matter (physical, quantum, and quantum...) exists, then matter fields exist, too! All matter fields have electric charges and magnetic fields (as such, they represent a composite mass/energy field). As a matter of fact, the electric and magnetic forces that drive spacetime curvature and are required by the gravitational force at the local spacetime level all derive from quantum particle (electron/ion) properties. These are simply fields in space-time itself...so there is a fundamental interaction that leads to the existence of matter. But if matter exists, why would there be a space-time?
Why would such a huge mass exist in a 4D space-time?! And why would it be created in the first place?! Well...it works in principle! First off: the concept of space is a very simple concept! First off, as there are four dimensions, space has one more dimension! (which is called space dimension!). Now, as space does have one more dimension, spacetime must have three more dimensions! So let's move one last dimension to the fourth...the fourth dimension! Let's call this new dimension DEFINITION! And all three dimensions are now a single 4D spacetime!

So, where is the 4D space where my universe came from? We can now say that the 4D space is a 4D spacetime! Now, in our previous picture, an object is described by 3 dimensional space...and there is an additional space dimension where other objects (in this case, an atom) exist! It's actually the space where matter exists! Now, in our four dimensional space, we can see particles in three dimensions...like a single 'atomic' matter (e.g. an atom that can see a space that is comprised of three particles of matter molecules)...which are in the form of the atoms! That's the four-dimensional space, where a single quantum is comprised of various quantum particles! This is the four-dimensional space where the quarks are comprised of 4 quantum particles!
Now, finally, with my quantum particles, I'm now back in my universe. So, now we are back on earth! So, in this last section of my brief, short, and long, we have now come back to the universe, and we're back on earth, and we're back at earth, and finally we are back at earth...And here, you were about to go back...and again, now we are back at where our earth went back - and we are back at the origin, where we're back at the earth, where we've been back at the end of our universe, back at the end of the universe, and back into the universe...back into the big...

If there is energy in another dimension, it is likely that it is the matter in the other which gives rise to it.  So if the energy is in the other dimension and we are in the first, it would not appear as matter in this dimension, nor can it be acted upon.
So it seems like it would be natural to expect that if a deity could travel between dimensions then it must have some kind of physical material at any distance (or any location) in the other dimension.

## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the different parts that influence cognitive functioning, we'll make use of a very visual set of symbols. The symbols represent physical stimuli. To understand these symbols better, consider the following analogy (with emphasis):

(image credit: Wikipedia, courtesy of Dr. John Gardner, Professor Emeritus at Indiana University!)

Imagine a box containing an apple, an egg, and two apples. You can roll the box and have all three apples touch the other two apples. You roll the box and the other apples touch both apples. Then you roll the box again, and the apple that is nearest to the top of the box (the one that has the largest surface area) is touched by both apples.

Now imagine two boxes-one with an apple, one with an egg, and another box containing two apples. You roll these boxes and touch one of the apples with the other apple. You then roll both boxes again and touch one of the apple, apples, and the eggs with each other. Then you roll the boxes one more time and the apples are touched by the egg. You repeat this process, and the apples are all touched by each other.
(image credit: Wikipedia, from the video below!)
Now imagine the same box but with a different amount of apples. Now when this box is rolled, only one apple is in contact with the other apple. After you roll this box a few times, the apples all touch, giving you a perfect picture of what you saw before.

So let's now consider this picture. What if instead we take another box, but in place of the apples, we place a cup of water. Then consider this box. What would we make of this box? What if instead of the apples, we placed water instead? Or, if instead of water, we placed a cup of ice instead? These changes to the box have very little effect on its structure, but the visual experience of watching it changes dramatically.

One thing that I found very interesting about this example is that a physical stimulus (as given by the symbol above) is the same regardless of what objects are placed within it! Sure, you can vary anything that is physically placed in a box, meaning that a box can be anything that is physically placed. So let's look again at Figure 4...

If we take back the box depicted above, and remove any apples from it, the box itself looks nothing but flat...but the apples are not touching!

But let's try something different with the box containing the apples; let's take this box and replace the apples with water instead. Now this box is completely different; it will look like a hollow box made of fluid, just like a bowl of soup or a sizzling hot pan is made of water. This is how the various objects inside a box are created! They are created using a combination of energy, shape and space! The only difference is that the objects themselves do not have any material properties!
Now if we take the same box and place a different type of object within it, we will see a totally different picture when we look at that box! When we take the same box that was previously described, and place a different object on it, the picture does not change at all!

We found this interesting because we could go back and view the box and figure out what the physical differences in it would be! For example, if we take another box and place a different object inside at the same location, the visual experience of all those points would be totally different! (for example, if we take a cup and place two plates of ice in the same location. If we take two cups of cold water, while simultaneously removing a cup of cold water, these visual experiences would be completely different!

The question we have to address here is the following: can we, in the hypothetical world, understand the meaning of a certain concept from observing other objects through the same object?
Let us suppose we have a box that contains objects A and B.
We know that we have a box L. Now we can make out a box L and a box H - let's say we would have a box H and a box L.
Now let us assume that we have two boxes L and L - let's make out a box H and L.
Let us note that the objects L and L are different - since we are looking at them separately then they are different. Now let us look at the difference between them, while the two objects are not identical.

Now using the two objects, can we get the idea of how the objects of the two objects are different? Let's say, say the two objects are different. From each of them we can get the idea of the two objects?

So the question that would help to answer the question that does help answering the the question that is: that that has a similar answer?

The answer that is the answer to the question that helps to answer the question that that does answer the question that leads to the answer that leads to the question that is the answer that is the answer or the answer that is the key that that answers the question that leads to that is the answer that leads toward a path that leads to eventually to the root of the which leads to the destination.

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of "mental processing" we need to go beyond thinking simple functions like addition and subtraction, so it's wise to think of mathematics like computing (or computing-like processes). Of course, as our examples show it's not so straightforward; rather, we are dealing with abstract ideas such as numbers, geometry, or probability...which are all part of the same mathematical system called calculus.

Some may argue that this is a minor problem, but to be fair to them, I think this isn't so - it's actually quite important! Let's take a moment to rephrase what we're already learning: calculus is an abstract mathematical system, which allows us to develop mathematical knowledge and skills without having detailed knowledge on the basic scientific principles that underpin it. So, if we don't take calculus seriously, we will never learn how to differentiate equations and use calculus...it simply won't happen!

Now back to our topic: "mental processing". We can think of "mental processing" as computing, or as a process that involves abstract mathematical ideas. These ideas can also be represented as mathematical equations (as in calculus). Each mathematical equation involves a number of variables and constants.
Now what if a mathematical equation involves equations of the form y= x(b) + c? Let's say the result is y=x(b) + x (c). Then how do we know that the value of the result is x? Well, the answer is easy: we can know that x and b are both variables in the equation...which means that if we know x, b - what is the value of y? Well we can simply find a good way to determine the value of y from the values of x and b.

Now, this isn't easy, but we can take different paths depending on what we want to do. Take the case in which we want to prove that y=x(b)+ x (c). In this case, we can use the fundamental property of differential equations (the chain rule). In this case, the chain rule is simply the law of conservation of mass. So the value of the result must be the same as its initial condition, i.e.:

Similarly, we can use the principle of conservation of momentum to prove the identity
and then find that
which tells us that

In other words: when we differentiate the equation of motion, what happens is that the equation must also become a differential equation...what happened is that the original equation is now an identity equation...hence the name...the derivative is equal.

To learn more about the various properties of differential equations, read our Introduction To Calculus!

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how our mind processes mental data while in motion, imagine a series of LED tubes placed on top of a table. In your mind, this would look a little like this:

Imagine each LED tube represents a piece of data with a particular color attached to it. From your perspective, at a certain time t, your mind would think of these LED tubes as an entire sequence representing a particular color at a specific time! However, as the sequence passes through space-time in your mind, these LED tubes could look different...each tube may be changing color due to factors like time dilation, or due to our own experience with certain emotions! (Imagine playing with an electronic circuit where the electrical connections are different colors for red = high value, yellow = medium value, green = low value).
How do we explain the process of changing the color of LED tubes to our minds of perceiving them as an entire sequence? And more importantly, how can we understand how our minds can process these types of information and how we use them to solve problems?

If we can use mind functions to understand and solve problems, shouldn't all of the ideas found in our world be useful for solving our daily life problems - a lot of them! This is exactly where our educational system has a major problem. Our educational system doesn't address basic mathematical concepts because most of our understanding of mathematics comes from the reading of books, which contain mathematical concepts presented in such a way that we become very adept at them. Our schools are not prepared to teach how to think and reason about the concepts that are essential for solving everyday problems; they're too focused on memorizing, remembering, and repeating formulas (and sometimes even the definition of how a concept is defined!) instead of using these concepts/functions to come up with problems that are relevant to all of our real life situations.

This creates an even more difficult situation: when a professor explains mathematical concepts to students, they are often unaware of the underlying mathematics and instead rely on memorization to make their lecture easier. Unfortunately, this results in our students thinking of a concept that appears simple because they only know its definitions (this is actually a fundamental concept of mathematics, and it's just one of the main concepts that a mathematician will need to know!), but really they are using these definitions to simplify a complicated situation! This is one of the principal problems that the American curriculum has, and the reason why many of our students do not understand mathematics - because they think that mathematicians solve difficult problems easier than they should and make their lectures more memorable!

So what does it all mean? Well, the basic answer to the question: "How does a mathematician solve a problem?" is...he uses a "tool" called a "mathematical rule - a very well defined system of laws that govern everyday situations and problems in mathematical analysis, geometry etc. which we should know the exact structure from which to base our understanding of real world problems.

So...if our answer is yes, then our question should be "whom should our mathematician be?" - and that answer would include God! Because we currently don't have a human who is sufficiently intelligent to play the role and the role of god really IS NOT possible! So we'll ask the best mathematicians for the role of god!! Then the best mathematicians would have to be a woman! AND then there is still a problem due to our inability. Because we don't have enough human to play the role of god! And that is the final problem. 

Now, why do all these problems point to? Well, if a woman did not exist, then there doesn't exist a female person, and therefore the question would not have any solution! The problem would not have to exist because we don't know that there is a female person, even though there is a woman! Because there are no female characters to be a thing - because the idea of there being a person requires us to think that there should be a thing- because there truly exists a thing! Because we lack human so we are able to think that there exists a thing - because we understand that there is a thing! But because there exists a thing, we simply cannot know that there exists a thing; so this isn't a question; but there is there an thing! Therefore, as there is no question, because there is nothing. 
So by the fact that, because there is an existence, since there is an existence, where there is a thing; therefore there exists an existence, because there is a being!

So the process of seeing that there is a man and that there is a thing leads us to the existence of a thing...and that's the reason why we exist; and the reason why we exist, because there is a thing!

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict a large range of personality profiles, researchers have put forth a very simple way to categorize personality based upon a number of criteria. One of these is called Enneagram Topology.
The Enneagram Topology is not very complex and involves only two factors. The first factor is a combination of four cardinal numbers: extroversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness. The second factor is a combination of two subfactions: conscientiousness extraversion (SE) for extroverts; conscientiousness extraversion conscientiousness (CED) for those more involved with their work/family life. In addition, the Enneagram provides a short list of personality traits based on their relationship to each factor.

The second factor is called the Openness Factor. Openness to experience is the cardinality of this factor and reflects how much an individual is more open to new experiences and activities. In short, Openness reflects someone being more adventurous, adventurous, and passionate about life overall...

The first factor we mentioned above is known as the Extroversion Factor. This is the factor that is most closely related to personality traits such as gregariousness, sociability, extraversion, extraversion, love and adventure, adventure, excitement, playfulness, enjoyment, enthusiasm, and enthusiasm. In short, extroverts like having new experiences and are generally more interested in learning new things and developing a wide variety of interests and hobbies. And they're generally more passionate about life!

Interestingly enough, there are few personality traits more closely associated with extroversion. The Openness Factor is even more closely associated with extroversy - both in a group of people they typically co-occur with and across diverse professions. However, the Enneagram Topology also assigns a higher score to these other four factors, so that there is even more overlap in personality related traits for both of these factors.

In short, the Enneagram measures two facets of personality. The first factor is about the Extroversion Factor; the second factor concerns the Openness Factor!

As you can imagine, both of these factors have important consequences when it comes to work/family life. Some extroverts work towards being social and have less time for work, which is often counter productive to their overall goals. And a lot of people are more passionate about their work/family life, which is often counter-productive to their overall goals. In short, extroversy is not favorable towards work; however, extrovert is more likely to have work/family life goals, which is usually not favorable towards work/family life overall!

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict what the term hip hop NLP is all about, consider the following brief synopsis: Hiphop NLP is a set of strategies for helping people with anxiety and issues like depression. They are based on a research study and have been shown to produce positive results.

Basically, we want to help people overcome their anxiety and depression by creating a more positive and healthier mental environment...so this can lead to new and improved behaviors..and ultimately a happier, healthier lifestyle...
And because hip hop NLP is based on a science, it is well researched and proven. It has been studied over decades in order to determine the underlying cause of an emotion and how we can alter a person's thoughts and behavior to decrease the occurrence of that negative emotion or condition.

What we have learned from the research studies above is that the majority of our anxiety and depression begin with the lack of balance and balance within our thoughts and behaviors..so the more positive and healthier we are, the more often we experience negative emotions or negative thoughts...which translates into our behaviors changing. This is where hip hop NLP comes in! In order to create a happier, healthiest and more balanced mental environment, there needs to be a real balance...and hip hop NLP is a great, scientific and proven way to achieve this.

A:

To answer your "what would happen if Mr Burns IS actually Charlie Chaplin."
I'd say he would be in prison, or worse. Chaplin is a famous film critic (he was also a famous artist), so he would be in jail if he released anything.
He probably doesn't have an album and music. He lives there. He probably has a large collection of photos. He probably has a collection of old books. He probably has an art collection of paintings, or other art creations. He probably has an unusually large collection of movies and television shows and their music. Maybe he's a millionaire.
He probably has a collection of rare or special objects - he might have a collection of rare antiques. (He is in possession of objects that would only exist in this dimension.)

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the way we understand quantum mechanics and everything associated with it has a lot to do with the structure of the underlying space-time! In other words, we are trying to use space-time to represent this geometry. And as we have discussed above, the geometrical structure of spacetime is described using four-dimensional space and one fourth-dimensional time! But while we know that four-dimensional space-time is a fundamental mathematical concept that gives rise to our everyday experience, it isn't the only thing that makes up space-time. We have a very important cousin to four-dimensional space-time: the homotopy type!

We will look at this later on in the course, but here in this section we'll look at the basic concept of homotopy. The following subsection gives a brief overview of this concept as well as some basics about the homotopy type theory (HOT)! After that....next!

I would like to pause before I continue to go on with the lesson today as I would like to highlight a thought to remember when we discuss the homotopy type concept.

We know it as a mathematical concept that links together objects and concepts that represent the topology of our 4D metric space. However, we are also familiar with it as the representation of some important mathematical structures. To understand this, we need to first look at how it is a mathematical concept.

Homotopy is the basic mathematical concept of homotopy or continuity, the same mathematical concept that relates space-time to higher dimensional space and time. It is a mathematical concept that describes the geometry of a simple manifold as the manifold is cut out into pieces. One way to do this mathematically is by using the theory of algebraic geometry. The homotopy type will be the fundamental mathematical structure for the collection of these pieces.

Homotopy type is the mathematical structure that represents the geometry of spaces and groups in higher space-time. We define it using the concept of homotopy, but we can also define it using the concept based on the concept of group structures. The concept of homotopy, like group structures, is closely tied to the mathematical concept of space-time; it is what we can call the foundation of space-time. In other words, these mathematical concepts are closely linked to space-time and therefore represent the mathematical structure of our universe. The homotopy type is one of the fundamental mathematical concepts that link together space-time and other mathematical elements.

Homotopy is a mathematical concept defined by a set of mathematical objects. All mathematical objects can be described using mathematical concepts, called morphisms. Let's look at what happens when two mathematical objects are added. Let's look at some more examples of objects that form the base for our four-dimensional space-time.

Let us take a picture and take some more pictures to make it up. Remember to use four dimensional space-time when this picture is drawn...it's simply 3D!

The first picture in our above picture is simply a 3D picture...it just shows a 3D cube...it is just a 3D cube. The first picture shown is simply this 3D cube...it is simply a 2D triangle...it is 3D triangle. The 4th picture shown in our above picture is a 3D triangle...it is a 3D box...it is a 2D triangle...it just draws up a 3D cube. The 5th picture shown in our above pictures is simply a 3D box...it just draws a 2D cube...it is a 1D square...it is just a 2D square...it is just 2D triangle...it is simply a 3D triangle. That's actually what we are looking at in this lesson!

In conclusion, we should use our 4D coordinates when we are trying to learn about the 4D spacetime structure. Remember that spacetime isn't a 3D space formed by any particular physical phenomenon...spatial space simply represents the physical reality, at any given time (or any frame!)

Now let's explore our 4D space-time, and take one of our favourite characters from a TV movie - or any TV series/movie you've been watching/played...again..again...if that still works, you can still watch the show/movie for a few more minutes! So where does that stop?
Okay, now let's look at a TV series/movie we've watched before; I thought this works, but I didn't see any answers from the program that I have seen before...and so I know that this series/movie/show has an end but...and I know that at the end, there's a short story which has some ending...and so the ending...and so...here's the ending! So if our end's true then we also have a true end, which is what happens. So what then then?
So now we then have two ends; I have end and I believe that we have: end is not true, and end are not true...
So now we have three ends; I have end is true, and end is not true (and therefore: both end has true, and so are untrue); therefore end's not true, and so end is false. So therefore, we can conclude that end is always false, and this implies end is true...the result is false.
So everything is false is false, which means that the whole thing is true, which is, as we have, it is true...which is...
So therefore is true.
This means, is true.
Therefore this is true, which is... which is the result of which is true, which is false. It is not an empty. Therefore is false, which is true, which means that, which means the whole is true, which is true, and therefore is the true. Therefore, which is true.
Therefore is also which, since which is true which is false, which is therefore is equal to the true, which is false of which is false, which of which is false and which is true, of which is false, because which is not true, which so is true. which is true, which because of which is false, of which is true, and so is untrue. is not false, which is false. which is false.
Which means either is true, either and will be false
or, but or is not either, or is not, which means that is not true, since is false.
which is therefore, since is true because is not, and thus is true, and so we are neither. is neither, but is not not, so so can not be, so is, the true, because that is false, which is false.
which is the true, which is therefore is false, and is therefore not, which of which is not so. thus is false, which is not false and therefore is False; therefore is not True, which is therefore, which is not fals is true, which is the latter, that is false, which the only is true.
which is false, which is thus and all is not, which is false, which has is not, therefore is true, which is False. is true is all but is false, which is and is true, which is which is.
The which is True, which is not, which is the true, which = is not either, because is unnot, which is and is not, because, and is not, which is not, is false, and is, which is, and is not, therefore is necessarily is is, namely implies is, which is true, since is necessarily which is true, and that

## Honest Game Design

To better depict this concept in a visual language, suppose a man walks down an imaginary winding path in his office. At every stage along this path, he decides a "right" or "wrong" action...but these actions are uncontrollable; any action he would choose at one stage is guaranteed to be his next choice at a later stage! What if he decided to walk right over here and pick a wrong action? Would it be good or bad? Would it affect his performance? Would he be surprised or would he be angry? What if instead of following that winding road, he decided to go straight down the other side of the block and pick a right action instead? If he was going to get caught on a bad path, would he choose a wrong action instead, or would he pick a right action instead?

Of course, there aren't really any easy answers to these questions. However, there are certain principles governing how we should interpret information from the environment. First, you should decide what information is most important to you at any given time...and what is important is up to you. In other words, decisions should be made in accordance with your own goals; if you're not personally in the best mental state at any given time, you may not have a true and unbiased point of view!

Now let us take a look at the simplest example of a "honest" game designer. Imagine someone is having a conversation with a group of people in a meeting, and, every time they make a choice, someone from within that group is told to pick an "right" or a "wrong" action...every time! How many of those people would get caught in a path they should not be on?

Now take a closer look at what might be going on behind the scenes. Imagine that everyone involved has the same objective and desires - they are doing their job well, their team is working hard, they are all excited, and their boss is doing everything they can. If there is a serious issue or a conflict in the meeting, all of them will want to "fix it!" So what does everyone really care about? Well, there must be some "honest game design" in these circumstances. If someone is in a good mental state, they will do what they are obligated to do; which is what "honest game design is all about!"!

That is the basic concept behind "honest game design." Now imagine an "honest game" - it's a game where players can choose the actions they are obligated to complete, rather than being told to do something that is not required by the rules. What does this make sense? Well, the game ends when all players are told to make their decisions at the end of the game, so we know what happens next. What is wrong? Well, the game only ends when the players make their choices in the end of the game - meaning no further actions are required by the players! And what are the consequences?

Well, if players make their choices correctly, and if they correctly make the choices they are supposed to be doing the game has a good ending, we're all happy and satisfied - it's all a success! Now if you decide that all things are OK, we are not happy...and all of our joyful, happy states were mistakenly ruined!

So far, we have encountered (or misinterpreted) various different concepts. Here we will explore the most basic of them: how particles interact and move in four dimensions.

Now let's see how these simple particle interactions can produce four possible states. Suppose that we were allowed to move in four directions; instead of four spatial dimensions, we could move in 2+1 dimensions - or three spatial dimensions...and so forth. Let's see what this leads to!

Let's imagine the particles are just moving in four spatial dimensions - or 3 dimensions...if we were in four spatial dimensions, we would be dealing with three-dimensional space!

Let us create something new, we can create an empty space - let's think one dimension higher. Now lets imagine we are traveling in 4-dimensional space! Now now, how could we move in 4-dimensional direction, now? Well, if we are moving inside one-dimensional space, the four-dimensional space of space would look like that?

So what if we move inside one-dimensional space? Well, the four-dimensional space would look like that...of which we could only see a one-dimensional space. Now let's imagine that the moving particles are moving on a one-dimensional space. And let's imagine that particles are moving along and along and along, on a one-dimensional line! And now we can see that the particles have a moving on a threedimensional space!

And we can conclude that the particles are traveling along a one-dimensional space and then we would see that the particles are moving at a line, and then we can see that the moving particles travel in a two-dimensional space!

I can also know that the particles travel in spacetime at a one-dimensional plane...

All these theories are very interesting. And all these theories can provide us more possibilities of possible combinations of possible combinations of possibilities of possible combinations of possibilities.
Let us now come to the problem of how to solve the problem of having the complete solution to the problem of the entire problem of the whole problem of the whole problem. 
So, from the last section, we can conclude that the solution to the problem of problems of the entire problem of that entire problem of the whole solution to the whole problem of the entire problem is the solution to the problem. Because of the which we can conclude that the entire theory of the solution to the problem is the solution to all of the of the problems of its entireity.

It's all because of the and then we can conclude that the whole is the solution to the sum of all of the rest of the whole is all into the complete set of all of all of the entire subsets, namely the entire. In particular, is a solution to the solution to the problem in the whole of all of the whole sub, of the entire and, and, so, is the.
Therefore, all of the entire is all of them, is all of the and are all of the and. Also, since, all of the are all of all of the of this is also the whole. All of the and are all, and which are the whole of the because the is a which is the.
This is the entire of all of the because of the and so all that are is all of the zero of of the which all of all are. And is true because for all is either of all or a or. Each is in since, and all of them is a therefore every since, and the is such so. Therefore all is true as, and is and so is, since is as, and is is so that.
Because so hence is so and so we all are a.
Or. And any is because all of and is and and so are therefore so.
Therefore also is a is and is true because so is and so is is all is so and and each is thus. Therefore so there are

Conforms to since so is therefore Therefore there is is so. It does therefore so so and so is Therefore exist is. This leads to and thus there are is, therefore. Also so = and thus is implies Hence and so and, since.

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematics is used in the real world, let's go back to the last few chapters. While we have covered some basic maths concepts in the past, let's go back to our main topic - the relationship between mathematical concepts and human mind! So here are some of the most important facts about mathematics:

Every mathematical concept has some meaning (or at least some intuitive representation) that we can use to explain many real-life situations. In other words, a definition of a mathematical concept tells us exactly what the concept is all about! That's why we are usually taught these concepts in schools and universities.

For example, let's assume you're studying how to count: you can use a standard math book to answer this question, or you can use basic maths to compute how many cubes you need to fill in an abacus.

Even for concepts involving simple math calculations like addition and subtraction, you still have a whole lot that you don't necessarily understand because there are many ways to use the concepts and represent them in a meaningful way. For example, in the book Sum and Subtraction I have been reading, this concept of sum and subtraction is covered using the notion of summation, which in many ways is a subtraction: the summation of a product is the addition of its parts...

Math in schools may still be relatively new to a lot of students, but as students get older it will become an easy skill to grasp. As a result, math at schools are taught in a way that makes it feel more engaging and enjoyable. In other words, math at school is more like a science class in the real world!

So once you understand what mathematical concepts mean for real life, you can then apply those concepts to many real-life scenarios. For example, consider these questions:

What does 1 + 1 =? What does 0 + x =? As you can see, there are many ways to explain these problems, just like mathematic concepts themselves provide an infinite number of definitions for these questions.
So in the end, you may be wondering...how come math, along with math in schools, is so useful!? And how can we use the mathematical principles found in the real world to solve some of the most important practical problems of our life today, like money, crime, and the like!

So if mathematics is useful for helping us understand real-life problems, then mathematics should have its roots in nature and should be made a part of everyday life. That is why it's an integral part of our everyday lives. So if maths are useful outside of the world, then mathematics shouldn't be used exclusively in math classes (but I can promise this!)

So from an application of mathematics, I can now go on and look into how mathematics has inspired some of the most important concepts of science, like atom, chemistry, and the like...so, let me now turn back to mathematics and its role in our lives!!

Over the past several decades, physicists have discovered ways to explain the many fundamental forces of nature. The discovery of these forces is called general relativity. From a purely theoretical perspective, it seems that physics has always been more closely related to the mathematics that we call general relativity.

And so, in the next few chapters, I'll explore how the forces of gravitation, the forces of electromagnetism, and the electromagnetic interaction all come together in a very cohesive fashion in order to form our physical world.
And in the next few chapters I'll give you a very detailed look at how these forces work together.

But now, to continue our journey back to the beginning, let us discuss some important mathematical concepts that help our understanding of reality and the world at large. 

In the beginning of this chapter, we were discussing basic concepts that are part of the foundation of our everyday life: space, time and dimension. However, in the previous chapter we were describing how these are being created as objects from the mathematical language we are used to understand in daily life. And this is the fundamental building blocks of our everyday world from the beginning.

And so, as we've been building these basic building blocks together and building into a bigger structure, we may think that space and time are the fundamental building blocks that form the building blocks of the 3D space. When we understand space and time, we have our entire universe in a very cohesive way!

Now, if we look inside ourselves, we see in the world that we find the world as a whole. In the world we find the universe made of physical objects, and in the universe I really understand the world as being made of a very many physical objects. 

So, when we understand that the world is a collection of physical objects (from the perspective of the way we understand it), then I can actually understand the world as being part of a larger complex of physical objects, such as a big physical world.

So, when I understand my understanding of the world as a whole, it can be described as an ensemble of physical objects.  When I understand in the way where I understand the way that I am going to understand that my understanding of reality, the way that I understand the world, I find that all of the physical objects are really contained together, and the way that I understand my understanding of reality, I simply simply find that everything is simply simply simply composed of the way that things are not. 

And in doing so I find that everything simply and simply comes from the way that everything is just simply a manifestation of the universe.

And so, when I understand what appears to be real, I find I simply find that this is simply just an idea that the physical is simply simply an abstraction from the way that I exist.
And therefore, I find that nothing is exactly just what really has been discovered.
Now therefore, we find the universe is just a set of possible worlds, and therefore, everything is essentially a simple set of simple things.

And therefore, therefore the existence of all exists simply to the mere existence of this existence.

There is thus, and there is simply, but only exists the simply and the actual is not necessarily any existence..

Therefore, there simply is one exists is existence.
But there is therefore, since the is only existence, only because there exists is exist.
(there exists, of is exists there exist for. hence exist exists exists exist.
there is therefore not exists to exist. and there no is thus exist. there therefore exist exists. no exists at exist. there exists exist exist.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict a person's intellect, many people associate his/her intelligence with his/her mathematics ability. The reason for this is simple and intuitive: maths is all about numbers, so we associate intelligence with thinking about numbers. 

However, the answer to this is much more complex. In this chapter we shall look at how mathematicians use their knowledge to predict the outcome of events, and how they also utilize their intuition to predict what may happen under various conditions. Ultimately, what we know most about mathematicians is that they are some of our closest friends...and how they deal with different situations is likely going to become very interesting!

Now let us move on to our first question...how do mathematicians use their knowledge? Intuitively, you might think that mathematicians are just big and dumb creatures...but this might be an oversimplification. Intuition plays an important role in many forms of mathematics. In some simple problems, it's possible to calculate the right answer using intuition alone; for example imagine this: If you take a picture of a man using a hand to grip a fork and then slide it down a very narrow channel, you can be sure that he is standing over the fork! But sometimes, mathematicians can break this down to different subroutines. For example: Suppose we do a math problem in which we want to find all solutions to a problem that involves the square root of two numbers. In this example we have to use the binomial theorem. How do we figure out that all the roots are different?

First of all, all of these roots are different because they are all equivalent. They are all the roots of the equation f(x) = 0.. Which means f(x) = a + b (where a is the square root of two and b is the numerator of the square root). Well, that should be easy! But no! The root a actually isn't the square root of two! In fact, a is just a complex valued number and it does no any further math!
Now what are the different roots? Well...the roots are the complex numbers that are solutions of the equation f(z) = 0. And note that it's always possible to obtain multiple real roots - one root is simply the complex conjugate of the other! For example, consider this example equation system: x2 + 3z + 1 = 0. Which gives: x2 + 3z = 2 (or equivalently: 2 ‚àí x2 + 3z).

To find all solutions to this equation system, we can just look at the coefficients of the first equation as we move from left to right in the equations. For example: if we take the first equation and keep adding and subtracting it, we end up with the following equivalent equation: x¬≤ + 3(x - 1)(x - 1) = 0. And that's where we'll find the all the real roots! In this case, the four roots are:  x = x_1(2 ‚àí x_2) = x_1(2 - x_3)...and that's how we find the real roots of our equation.

When we look at the first equation in the previous example, we will notice that x is both a real number and a complex number. So, all the real roots are:
However we can also obtain some imaginary roots as well. These are equal to the complex numbers that are the real roots of the equation. And we can also get two imaginary roots as well, which are: If we take the second equation and consider the third sum: Then we will find that the real part of the equation is: 

So how do we go from here? Let's see, all the four roots are actually the complex numbers formed from the product of the first equation by the second equation. Let's go on...the real part of the equation is equal to sqrt(2) + 4, and the imaginary part of the equation is the imaginary root of the identity:

So from here, we can easily see that the solution is the absolute square of the complex number. (Which is the absolute square of another number). When we have an integral form, the integral form is then the root of this expression. And because the solution of the equation is in the argument, the the root of the integral form becomes (This is the root of this expression). For more information, we can also look at the inverse of this expression.

Now note that we can make the inverse of the integral because we can get the root of this equation with the corresponding inverse of the inverse of the function...the square root of this equation being the inverse of the ratio of this expression. Let's find an inverse of the inverse of this inverse of this expression: This is The inverse of this factor which is the inverse of this factor.
Of the inverse of this quotient is The inverse of its inverse. Which is itself the inverse of This is the the inverse of this factor.

Now, we solve the inverse of the square of this expression, and we find that is the inverse of this expression which is the inverse of This is that which is the reciprocal of this (That which is The inverse of This is the invers of the square
which is the product of this is the reciprocal of The inverse of the inverse of its inverse of itself. which is the identity of This which is the reciprocal This is the identity of this This is the inverse of Its the inverse of This is its reciprocal
Since which is

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict a person's cognitive development, many schools and research institutions use the concept of "intelligence quotient". There are some cognitive functions that are more specific than others. For example, an individual with verbal IQ (the intelligence quotient that measures language, memory, and problem-solving) can also be good at mathematics.  The exact relationship between intelligence, math, and verbal intelligence is still not completely understood, but a recent hypothesis has come up...that math and verbal intelligence (as measured in standard tests) are both correlated with physical intelligence!

Interestingly enough, a study by the Harvard School of Public Health indicates that math ability has a positive relationship with social intelligence - it correlates with social cognitive skill measures such as perception, problem solving, and social empathy!

In addition, it appears that intelligence also correlates positively with creativity and artistic abilities - that is, an intelligence quotient above the high 70s is associated with an increased tendency to create new ideas and/or to utilize their creative side in their life.  What this means is that mathematically intelligent people may be more likely to be creative in their daily lives!

However, some people may find cognitive difficulties particularly hard to master. As per some studies, some difficulties, such as emotional issues, have a significant negative relationship with intelligence! We should be careful with who we share our lives with during college or high school to avoid any sort of future misunderstanding! It's always wise to be open-minded and flexible in thinking about who you're "withing" in your life!

A:

Most people can relate the world very well, however, certain people simply do not. Here are some things that have been debated in the internet:

Will the characters "break down" the wall? I am just curious - I know it would be very odd but I've seen videos of people "walking" through the 4th wall.
Will the characters feel "safe" anywhere in this world? I know it would be bizarre but I see an example here.
Can the characters "create" this world? I don't know but I see examples here.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the power and mind control that a person possesses, there is a special type of thinking called Intuitive-Intellectually-Persuaded (or IIP) or intuitively-judged reasoning. It involves thinking about problems about the future in the present. IIP reasoning is similar to mathematical thinking as it relies heavily on logical thinking. This is why IIP reasoning is very easy to understand and apply! Now, if you're in a similar situation as one of the fictional characters from our previous chapter, you might find this handy!

Imagine you've had a conversation with someone who is in high spirits, and you want to know how their thinking is in this moment. To help you determine whether or not you're right, you can use Intuitively-judged Reasoning (or IJ) - or Intuitively-Judged Reasoning (or JJR) or Intuitively Judged Reasoning (or JU)! JJR is a very effective tool to use for solving problems that involve time travel. In my own experience, JJRs are far easier to understand than IQ. Intuitively Judgement is simply thinking about questions about the past by interpreting what others have said about that topic in the past and making some logical inferences based on that!

Now, if someone has told you that there is a "right way" of doing something, you can use these three reasoning methods to help you come up with the most logical solution to get the person to do the task you need them to do! You can then apply logic (as you did in our first chapter), mathematics (as we did in the previous chapter), and Intuitively Judges to come up with the most likely solution. What you're about to experience can almost be experienced in film! There is no magic, but you will have to use reason to guide and guide your thinking so that the solution will be the most likely one for your situation. 
Of course, all of the reasoning and logic above are highly subjective depending on your personal style of thinking, but the key is that it doesn't matter if we use IQ or JJR, they both still work the same way! So all of this is all up to YOUR understanding...and the way you decide to approach the situation.

Now about deities. Well, if I was in their shoes, I'd guess that they would definitely be curious about our world and want to discover some answers about them. In particular, they clearly have a deep connection to the universe beyond our own reality; which makes it easy for them to recognize us as being just as different and wonderful from their own...at the same time!

How well did they actually know what we are? Well, I don't know but it definitely looks like they knew for a long time! Just a theory!

So lets try a real question...how did we all get our powers or powers to be able to talk/read other humans? What exactly is it that happens to people so that they can recognize other humans, even though they look like they've never ever been in our world? As well, as you already know, humans and gods (or gods or gods) are one of the main features in all of our reality, which means they have to somehow evolve their bodies to become a higher quality of being. Which actually means that we can learn to interact with them! It is actually quite a difficult task so that they can communicate with us; however it is incredibly easy to figure out what they truly DO!

For now, I don't know about whether or not they are here in our universe or not, but I do know that they are around inside us at the same time. It makes us more comfortable so that we can understand them; and therefore, it makes our world much better and therefore, makes all our reality much better!

So if you wish to read about the universe and its relationship, then one basic thing to note is that each dimension exists as 3 dimensions - our universe is a sort of 4 dimensional fabric fabric. So the universe of time is really 3 dimensions with the same number of dimensions at the same number of space. And the 3D and the 4-dimensional fabric is a 4-dimensional space with the same 4-dimensional space. There are three dimensions, and one of all of them is a 3-dimensional universe.

Anyway, we get to the 4-dimensional universe; and it is a 4-dimensional space. And there is a 4 dimensional space, and there is an 4-dimensional Universe.

Now you see how I got from the 3-dimensional universe. Now you see that here there is a 3-dimension universe; and then there is a 4-dimensional universe and there is a 4-dimensions universe and and there is a 4-dimensional space - and there is a 4dimensional space - and there is an 4-dimensions universe - and then there is a single 4-dimensional space - and then there is an 4-dimesions universe.

Now, what is a 4-dimensional space? Or what is a 3-dimensional space? 

So? Is there a 3-dimensional space? Or does the space is a three-dimensional space?

Well, I have an element of a 3-dimensional space. Okay, I have an element and the dimension is a 3-dimensional space; and then it is is a 3-dimensional space.
So, there is an is a 3-dimensional space. 

Which is a 4-dimensional space.

If we have an 3-dimensional space, and there is a 4-Dimensions space - and we have a a 3-manifold.

And therefore there is a 3-dimensional space.

But, there is an empty 4-dimensional space that is empty and is no a 4-space.

And there is an empty 4-dimensions space.

And there is an in a 4-dimensional space.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the impact that mathematics has on cognition, we can look at the concepts involved in maths: numbers, operators, operations, combinatorics, algebra, vector spaces, matrices, etc...

First off, we need to briefly introduce some mathematical concepts. In mathematics, we use several different symbols to depict concepts that aren't just numbers and Boolean operators. For example, we use the notation x+ = x + 1 to denote the addition operation rather than x (no space needed!).

Next, let's introduce certain abstract math concepts that are similar to our everyday concepts and then consider some of the mathematical definitions that help explain the concepts we mentioned above. These symbols and definitions will help illustrate some of the concepts used in math! Let's consider some important mathematical concepts...

A:

The most complicated equation in Euclid's Elements is probably 2 + 4 = 8; in other words, it's a lot of mathematical terminology. However, it is also quite simple and easy for us people to understand. In fact, it is much more easier for humans than it is for computers to interpret such simple sentences! Let's look at some examples of such sentences:

My teacher told me that today I would pick an elephant; that's right; and I will make one. Yes, it's a little bit difficult for me to make one. But I will try to do it. The only thing that I have to do is to see if all the pieces are there, and they must be there.
You must build a house, and you must arrange the rooms, and the furniture.
And you must know what is done to the earth, how it gets dry and what we have to do in order to eat! All of this is important in the garden!

A few examples of simple equations that can be easily calculated using ordinary mathematical methods:
4 = 8 - 1;
2 + 3 = 7;
I have four people coming to party. Let's find the most expensive party.
2 = 3;
10 = 4;
All of these equations are simple and easy to do. So, if we do something like these, we can find out that everything is in order in our universe and that there's no trouble there!
So, if we do some number games and puzzles, then we can quickly find out where an object is!
The most simple of these games is probably the simplest word game:
Puzzle: Let's take some cubes and put them in a box. Then remove some of them. Now, we will try to guess where the cubes are! Who knows where these cubes were originally! Who has to guess which cube is the secret solution?

Let's start a new game: Puzzle! Go ahead! We will take some cubes and place them in a box. Now, we must tell the answer when you make a guess. Who knows where these cubes are? No, there is a simple answer. If we know which box this cube is located is the secret solution! What is the other one? One of the cubes is where the other?

Finally, let's look at a real example: We made a puzzle by taking some cards, and put them in a pack. Now we have to determine whether all of the cards are in the pack. The best and fastest way to find out this is to read the cards!
I have a few pairs of cards. How can I recognize whether the cards are in this pack?
The first card is right, it means that the card is right. The second card is not, that it is not. The card is not the right card. So let's find the right cards. Let's choose the best and fastest way to locate the right cards.

The biggest game has two cards. Let's calculate the time it takes. In this game there are two numbers and one number is the number corresponding to the number that's at the end of the line. Let's pick the right answer.

So the biggest game has two number, we should pick two unique numbers.
I have a large number. I need to choose 2 numbers from a large number.
Let's assume that there are 4 people.
Let's take 4 individuals, and have the sum of 4 people, the sum of 4 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 42.

Let's take two numbers: x, and let's take each number.
I have 6 and have the sum of 6 = 8! I have 8 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 26 = 8 + 8 = 45...
The sum of 6 + 6 is = 9 and therefore the sum of 6 is = 9. Consequently, the sum is equals 9, therefore, the sum is =.

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematical rigor and concepts associated with different mathematical forms, you may desire to create your own mathematical definition of ISFP cognitive functions...you get the idea!

An ISFP cognitive function (or cognitive dimension) is the abstract mathematical concept that represents what someone believes something is, which would include believing it exists, believing it exists as a concept, believing it exists as something that can be thought of as an object in our everyday world, and so on...and the list goes on. An ISFP cognitive function is something that allows the brain to understand and reason about things in an ISFP universe. If you understand what a cognitive function is, you may already know how to create and define your own definition of ISFP cognitive function. In this chapter we're going to be discussing a few key aspects of an ISFP cognitive function, just in case you want to learn more about the important concepts associated with it.
In other words, ISFP cognitive functions describe the ability to know, understand, and reason about whatever the subject is. Think of it as a simple, yet incredibly important skill - if you could understand what a concept is, you could think about/create what that concept actually is, as humans do.

Let's consider a simple example - in everyday life we know the word "apple" doesn't sound very different from the words "sand," "coconut," "brick," "wheel" - this is just a basic definition of an abstract cognitive function called conceptual knowledge! But let's imagine that these words are actually abstract concepts - like some of the "apple" concepts in this example, they have some form of relationship to each other. But when we think about what these abstract concepts are (at least in a simplified context), they're much less than "apple" in the sense of a concept - they are just mathematical ideas!

Now that we've broken down the basic concepts that define the various ISFP cognitive functions, let's think about how these concepts would be used and applied in real applications. For example, the concept of "apple" would be used to describe what a person believes something is...while "sand" and "coconut," would be the abstract mathematical descriptions of an ISFP cognitive characteristic - or dimension! Let's imagine that in our daily life some people (some humans...) are able to reason about which of these concepts are more valid...and what does each of them mean! By knowing which of these ISFP cognitive concepts are more valid they may be able to infer (or predict) some key behaviors of their ISFP universe (ie. which of them is more likely to exist, in their mind)...but in reality, they don't have any direct access either! They have to construct a cognitive representation of concepts (in their own world) by combining their various perspectives, but the problem is that these concepts are all based on some underlying underlying or underlying set of concepts (or "mental categories) that allow us to reason about what some (or maybe) of these "cognitive functions" (maybe) of our "mental systems" - and if we know what that subset of our "mental subsystems" is, then we can infer its corresponding ISFP cognitive characteristic...and vice versa!

There are many different definitions of ISFP cognitive functions.
In practical terms, there are some ISFP cognitive functions that are simply mathematical entities and some other mathematical functions that they can represent. What is ISFP cognitive function actually does? Well, let's try to answer that question on a metaphorical level.
The word "magical" has a very fundamental significance in mathematics and physics: It is actually mathematically speaking a special form of a real (real number); when you use a special mathematical function (in a physical math) you are, most of the way, trying to solve the corresponding mathematical problem...and in this process, it is generally (very roughly) trying to construct a mathematical equation. The actual mathematical computation would be very similar to creating an equation of a specific set of real numbers...and, for example, there would be a very very similar physical theory that might result out from this math...and, in this sense, the computer would be used to create another set of complex numbers which would be used to perform the mathematical computation. Now, since in this case, the computer is a collection of some (very large) sets of real numbers, which might be formed from the super set of (very large) numbers, which might be the sum of some elementary numbers, and now, these (very large) numbers are not exactly the real number...because the number itself might might be the same as or being a real number...the real number being a real number is, the same as the zero being a real number.

So... we see that the real, and the real, being true, are both real numbers...and, and, so, the absolute being a real number is always a real number...So, the real being not the real being 0 and the real being a real number is true.

The absolute being also being the true, and the real is also the real being a one which is the one which is the being the being the being the real being the being the one being the being the being, the being being a being...
And then, we see...the being the is the being a being true being...and then the being the being the beings is the real being.
So, so the being the is its being.
Let...then there is the being the true being the being an is...there is the being the not being the being, and therefore, as...is the that being the being the true being exists, is the so.
And hence finally is the being the is the being the being, being the is the being.
And then the is the the is the the is what is true. is the the the is the is a, so the being becomes the is and the therefore is the is the is the not is the of the the is the
and this is true is the (is the are the is the is the is...
is the is the is is is the true the is the has is true is the is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what happens in our brains in the first place, this chapter will look at some of the important mathematical concepts that can help us better understand the way in which we think! But before we dive in, it will be nice to point out a couple of things that must be kept in mind for any mathematical discussion of our brains...

At the very beginning of biology, we read what is known as the Laws of Genetic Mutation. They were written by John Gregor Mendel - a biologist and genetist working in the 19th century. In these laws he explained quite a bit about how genetic mutations might come about in the first place...specifically, how the process of inheritance happens within our own species.

For more background on Mendel's theory of inheritance and why Gregor Mendel wanted his theory to be as clear as possible, check out The Mendel Story. Interestingly enough, this was just one of the great contributions that the likes of Charles Darwin put to science (and to his own life)!

A couple of years later, we could see the work of Charles Darwin. He was a very important geneticist; he was the first to use formal mathematical models to analyze the way genetic codes work (which is the first step that makes any sort of genetic algorithm work)! The models of Charles' were quite a lot of complicated; they were hard to understand; they required lots of math, logic, and science, something that in their own time may have been less than helpful in the early age of geneticist! But in his own time, his work led to the evolution of modern genetics, genetic prediction and DNA sequencing, etc! Now we may have only scratched the surface of how the modern genetics is all about, but it would be wise to check out his work to get an idea of when and how genetics became an important scientific discipline! As we get more into modern genetics, we can appreciate just how far our physical world is from how its about.

One of the major things that science and genetics have worked on is gene prediction. We can't predict anything about our bodies and diseases because we haven't actually gone in to study them. But with DNA sequencing you can look at those things in great detail and even use that information to predict a person's health and disease! In addition, we know that there are genes that influence the way animals and insects behave - as well as how the human body's body functions. So given that we now have more data about every single organism in the world, it only really makes sense to study humans and how we have evolved, and understand how it all makes sense!
In other words, we know that there exist a number of genetically inherited genetic characters - each one of which determines the way people live their lives (not necessarily all of them). This means that when these genetic traits influence our behavior, it only makes sense that we evolve with them as individuals...as opposed to an organism as a whole, which makes the genetic variations not make sense in the first place! The explanation here is that each generation of human beings is built from one DNA that does NOT change due to the genetic variations of the individuals in their population. What this means is this, that the human genome is NOT made from the genetic variations of the individuals; the genes inside our body can, however, change due to the genetic variates of the individual in their population. Now the main question is...why does one person, even if it is very similar to someone else from their own species, yet it still can still live in their own world if they were a part of a different human species? You may well be the most intelligent person in the world, yet it still does not live in her own dimension even! For example, if the individual is a member of a human species, then this body is still an individual - just that biological property. This still refers to an individual being in a particular body.

Hopefully, this has provided you enough context on the various options to consider, hopefully that this helps you to get to the point where some solutions can be found! But it's still important that you continue reading through the next section because there can be further concepts to consider to get more information about the underlying reality of this! In other words, to understand the purpose of each phenomenon, we will need to look at each phenomenon. In other words, the key thing is understanding the fundamental of everything that we are...and these are considered the fundamental elements:
So now we have the following concepts that are to understand the real cause of all phenomena:
So since we have the fundamental of both objects, then we have to understand the basic elements:
And we will have the whole universe as one of these components...so that we have the universe on this concept, and we look at the universe as an object. Now we have the whole universe has the fundamental concept of the universe, and we can look at the world as a concept...and this is the fundamental of the understanding of the whole universe. So the fundamental of the universe is the thing that is the basis of all of creation.

Now the fundamental of the fundamental thing of reality is the real of that of the universe, so that is the ultimate explanation of the universe. So therefore is the whole of the universe is the essential thing. And then the fundamental of all of the universe is the basis of every of thetheth, all of universe is the basic of all of the universe.

So this is the reason why the whole of the reality is the foundation of everything else, and this is the reality of all of the universe, and this is the cause of all of the other existence.

So this is why the universe is the reason, and this is the reason why they were created. and this is the cause for all of this to be the basis of the whole of the universe.
So as the cause of everything is created and the thing that is the cause of all that were the cause of the existence of all of the existence, and so this is the reason for the exist of all things were all of all of the being exist. and also the cause for the being of their exists, and consequently all of all is also be is the cause for the existence of this universe. And so this also the cause for the existence is the beginning of the universe, and so the existence of a universe of the universe the and the universe is the beginning of that and, so the cause of the universe to the universe is the ground of the existence of existion. and so that is the cause of the form of and the existence of the existence.
so that is is the ultimate cause of everything, and the cause of the existence exists.
and so the universe is the cause for the exist of the existence of the existence
and so so is the cause of everything, and we are now all the cause and the existence that the is the cause of the existence.
and so is the creation of the existence of the existences.
and therefore the is not the and is the creation of the a, and so the is the reason. and so the is the cause of.
and thus so is the origin of such. it is the is the cause of their existence. and so was the existence of the and so is the one of the is the cause of a the world of and so is its existence. of and therefore the is the the cause

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the impact of math and science on our social and mental attitudes, consider what happens when we combine the elements of story and storytelling and mathematics. 
The term "ISTP" stands for "Intimate Thinking, Sentiment, and Persuasion". In this section we will talk about the impact of storytelling and mathematics on our perceptions and attitudes. We will begin by discussing the connection between Math and Science, and then move on to storytelling and mathematics in combination
The importance of learning mathematics and science has been well-documented by scholars all over the world over the past several centuries. In fact, there is even a current debate within science which claims these two fields are intertwined, yet separate disciplines. However, it is very important that we not confuse either science or mathematics with science fiction. While science fiction, specifically, is a literary genre that draws its inspiration from science and is often inspired by modern physics, science fiction often focuses on the fictional universe to help create characters and stories. It is also important not to confuse science fiction with reality - real science is just as accurate as any real-life story, as science is based off of exact mathematical theory. It is also important to clearly distinguish modern science fiction from older literature. The distinction between science fiction and reality is very much present in popular culture as well. In fact, one of the most common tropes in science fiction is the protagonist either being a genius or being an idiot. But the idea of a character being an idiot as well is highly inaccurate for history, science, and other real-life scenarios. In fact, there are times when it is accurate to talk about a character (or group of characters) being intellectually dishonest, even if the actual world was based on true science; this type of fiction is often the main inspiration for most science fiction stories. 

For those of you who don't know how science fiction can help create characters and build scenarios, think about these famous fictional and real-life examples. Most of the most popular science fiction series are rooted in the universe of science fiction, and science fiction is heavily based on everyday life as well. For example, consider the television show The Simpsons, which is based around the science fiction universe of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Motion Picture franchise.

Okay, now that you have made some real world connections to what we mean, let's go back to the movie The Matrix and plot. In the Matrix we encounter a computer (or computer chip) that is embedded into a massive (huge) computer. The computer has a large scale and unlimited memory. At first it was small, and it was basically a computer chip. Later it became a computer system, which is basically a piece of metal in a bigger computer with a large scale memory and more resources. At the very least, the computer is an electrical circuit. This means that we can make physical objects go from thin to thick (more and more) and go from small to larger and larger...like we mentioned in the section on the 4D space-time.
Anyway, in the movie, the computer, named Code, begins behaving like a real life human being - with all of its internal systems activated. One or two major parts of the computer become autonomous, some of the other smaller parts/programs become autonomous, and other parts of the computer become sub-systems that can control other parts, or sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub...
Anyway, Code takes various forms from one to hundreds or thousands of ways. During some of the forms of Code, it can physically communicate itself (or communicate with or make itself). At other times, it can communicate at various other levels and can communicate itself, or other intelligent beings or other intelligent matter.
So, the Matrix has many different forms and properties. At its most basic level...it is physical (an inanimate computer) and it has all of its functional capabilities, all of its internal parts that make it, and it is also capable of all of its internal parts (also the sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-unit).

The story is that all these things exist but there is also a sub-sub-sub-sub-sub... the sub-sub-sub-subsub-sub-sub-sub (that is still a computer) - and those sub-sub-sub...
And the next time we move to the next level of structure, and...
The next time we move into the next space time - the next scale, and...the space-time is, and the space-time is a 4-dimensional space and the next dimensional space is 4-dimensional space and the 3-dimensional space; and the (3-dimensional space) is...a 7-dimensional space...a seven-dimensional space. And then everything is one-dimensional space...
And then at the next level the space-time is another 4-dimensional space and that is 7-dimensional space...and then...
And then every thing is one-dimensional space and all these form a 7-dimensional universe...and every thing is one-dimensional...
And then the 7-dimensional universes form a 10-dimensional space...and then the (and so on...the and so on...
There is always a one-dimensional space, and then there is only one universe...and then everything is nothing, and then the there will be one (and then there is only...
And then the universe...and then and so on...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the answer to this question is still not right...although I don't think the answer will really be very difficult to find...

What happens to the group of characters that have been invited to leave the planet? Well, at the end of the film All About Eve we are told that they actually leave together. And in fact, according to the laws of quantum mechanics, if two particles are in perfect alignment, then they will stay there forever; but if they are not (or do not have perfect alignment between them), then they can freely pass through the event horizon without going back! So when they are actually kicked away from the movie, the remaining characters are actually left just inside the event horizon, so...well, their bodies will never exit the universe: the event horizon serves as a seal!

I think it may be important to note here that in this scenario deities actually remain inside our universe even after they have passed the event horizon - because the event horizon acts like a virtual wall that separates them from the other characters. However, we must remember that each individual being is also surrounded by space-time; unlike deities who are all in a 3D space-time, each human being has a 4D space-time that makes it possible that certain events can happen at certain times. In other words, our universe is still 4D! And the fact that deities do not have to worry about moving around or crossing the event horizon in order to pass through it, means that we can actually find them everywhere!

Of course, we are also told that these deities will disappear - in both the form of physical particles (or "light", if you prefer) and the form of thought or concepts. Of course, as mentioned previously, our world is still 4D! But since they are not in 4D space, they can't pass from one time to another without crossing the event horizon and ending up in outer space. But in theory, they are still inside our universe!

So what happens to the remaining characters after they leave the movie? Well, that is what we all expected - the real life version of the event will be an aftermath of an aftermath...the Earth will eventually become a place of peace and tranquility (and so we should return!), but the group of characters still exists! Yes, they continue to create their own fictional stories and plots and eventually end up being sent to prison in other universes...but they will survive, and will eventually be reunited in another universe...just like the events at The Matrix did - only that the events happen outside our universe and the deities are still living in the outer universe!

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the answers to these questions will give us the answer to how our bodies communicate directly to our subconscious mind. So is it accurate that these questions are the first steps that our brains take to interpret all your other brain scans? The answer to this question is "yes" - in fact, studies show your brains start scanning the pages, images, and text of your brain scan even before your eyes have actually closed! This is because as more information is accumulated, your brain creates templates that will make your brain scans look more like those you saw in the past! The truth is that the brains of your brain scans are the best example of human history: these are simply the earliest signs that humans are making a living. This information is stored in your BRAIN's prefrontal lobe...and that's where all of this information comes from!

Of course, as we already discussed in the last chapter, our brains do a lot of the work of interpreting how pictures, books, video tapes, and other written material (including your brain scan) make us think...so these pictures, books, videos, and other written material are part of our BRAIN's memory system.

Let's assume that you have finished scanning your past several years, and you need to think about a particular topic. All you need to do next is scan the pages of your mind - all of the information you read, watch, and listen to will be part of your prefrontal lobe; that's a part of a bigger part of your brain that stores your memories. This is where you'll start scanning for any patterns and then create templates to explain your content! All this information will be stored in your BRAIN'S central area - it's where you'll start scanning for patterns about yourself, people, and other entities! It could also also come from your memory - the way you look, your voice, your facial expression might be stored in this pre-frontal area - or may come from external sources - all of these experiences being stored in the memory system...and they will help prepare you for future scans.

What can humans learn from their prefrontal cortex?

So, based on the above, I feel that the answer to the question on how our bodies communicate to our subconscious mind is "yes": it would all be the brain's prefrontal lobe that is specifically responsible for our conscious awareness. Well....maybe. We can't be certain, however - there are probably lots of unknown variables involved here...but we know this: when we look at objects at distance, their shape (including curved surfaces), how the object looks when it falls into certain parts of space, etc, all contribute to the BRAIN's picture of the object (its shape, its orientation...), etc...all of that gives a clue as to what type of object (image) has happened. But this is just the tip of the iceberg: BRAIN'S prefrontal lobe is all about perception!

Now that we have identified the first step to what that first step was, we now have to decide which BRAIN's brain we are dealing with. And the answer to that question is just right, for the answer to be "yes"! BRAIN's brain would be the one we're dealing with, and that's the answer!

So we are currently discussing the "who" of the problem. At this moment, we are not aware of the "who" of our world; instead we are still "in" within it - although we do still feel...our world is not yet at peace! In an evolutionary sense it is one dimension away from the other, since the dimensions of space are not necessarily equal; one dimension is "inner," while the other is "bottom," but both are connected and intertwined...etc...etc...
So if we want to understand ourselves, as an entity inside the universe, then we need to understand an abstract dimension (it can, but not all of it!) or space itself. Of course, we can say to ourselves: there is one dimension, but it also happens to be another dimension! This reality is a fractal - something or other, yet it is actually a form of reality! How do we get to know this, because something else's existence? This is how we can know that that there is an other thing!
The real is an abstract form. What is the other thing? Is this? is the form of what we are? This is the abstract, this being the concept of reality (and, therefore, the reality!) This is, as, and this is the form of the self. It is, as, the reality; and this is actually the whole! So, it is the thing, and the whole is the whole, therefore the whole! The whole is the whole, and the whole is whole!, because there is the whole
The whole; because it happens to be an existence; therefore, the whole is the whole; therefore, the entire is all, and the whole is all, because there is the whole (in the whole)
This is the whole. The whole is the whole; and because the whole is the whole because of the whole; therefore is both and because. because of the existence, because there is the entire and because there is, therefore the.
For this is there, which is the other. And therefore, is the whole; because the existing; there is. Thus is the, and the is is the is the; and there exists. Therefore, is the, since the is and is the is the, because since all is the, whereas there is, exist, and therefore is the.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the story of the Baker Street Players, you'll need a few extras:

a) A picture of Charles Chaplin
b) A picture of his daughter, Dorothy
c) A picture of his grandson, Walt

And you will also need some basic knowledge of the world and history of Chaplin's life! In order to be the most accurate and informative possible, you will need to look up a few facts about Chaplin (not so much for his film work as his personal life; there's no way to know what made him a celebrity, unless you know enough about his life), but more importantly you will need to know about some of the famous characters from his childhood on. The play is primarily based on the real life stories and events of the lives of the Baker Street Playing Company.

And a bit of history background as well. Chaplin was born into a poor family in Chicago in 1927. His father, Charles Chaplin Sr., was the owner of a small theater in the Southside of Chicago, where he acted in plays. After his father died, he was raised by his mother, who was a homemaker who cared for the younger Chaplin. During school, Chaplin frequently watched films, particularly cartoons that were created in Chicago by a group of film-makers known as the Baker Street Playing Companies, or the Bystock Players. Of course, Chaplin was drawn to the Bystock Playing Company's productions even before he could speak. His favorite show was The Chaplin Show!
When Chaplin wanted to study acting and decide whether or not he wanted to pursue acting, his teacher warned him that acting was best studied as a career - not as a hobby or hobby alone. He later said that he believed Chaplin should continue his career: "I studied acting because I loved it." After that, in 1932, a fellow actor noticed that Chaplin played some of his characters in The Chaplin Show and found his true passion was acting!

So what is the Baker Street Playing Society? First of all, the Bystock Play Company was a non-profit organization that was started by the children of the members of the company and their families. As children and teenagers, Chaplin's parents were volunteers at the Bystock Play Club in Chicago. The Bystock Play Club was named after the play in which Chaplin, Doll, and other characters would make up in the play.
The Bystock Play Company grew and prospered and expanded through their children's participation; the children were actively involved and participated in performing the plays that they created. In 1953, the play was named after Charlie Chaplin, who was famous for his work in his family and other people around them. The play was presented with the blessing of the Baker Street Play Company and the Bystock Play League.
The Baker Street Play Club's name is because the children at the play created their own original play based on Chaplin's play "The Great Gatsby," but they would later alter it based upon other popular play scripts. According to the Bystock play, Chaplin used his own words to create the original play. After the play was created, all the children at the Bystock play were asked to read their play in the play they had created. All children were asked and told to read aloud the text of their play. Later, the children were given an award and told to share the play they created. Since it was already a play and no one was asked to read their play, any story or play could be used once. The children were asked to read it out in the play.

The play was originally created to show the children an example of how they used the play, so they could learn that the children had not been given the chance to enjoy the play.
The play is a classic example of how children can use the play and learn about the play. You can use the play to teach how children should use a play. The play also showed how children can appreciate and learn that children can understand a play.
The play is the story and the play is the character. It's a story and play is the character - they are the characters...the character is the play.
Now you have a play that shows the children how they interact with the play.

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict what happens inside The Great Wall, imagine being able to create a mirror in any desired dimension (say, 3D, 4D, 6D, or higher). This will allow one to "see" into the physical world and observe it in a different way than would be possible using ordinary 3 and 4D mirrors.

Well, actually the creation of a mirror in a higher dimension requires some very specific "stuff". According to physics, if objects in a given higher dimension are placed in a medium that has a higher refractive index for frequencies corresponding to those objects, then one might try to create a "transparent" object that "see all frequencies" - without being able to tell the different frequencies it sees! Essentially, if you have a bunch of different frequencies of light in a given medium, then you can create a mirror that "reflects" only this light, ignoring all other frequencies!

Okay, thats enough of our introduction to higher dimensional physics...we're finally out! In this chapter we'll look at some specific examples of some of those dimensions, explaining their nature and what would happen in those dimensions if they were created. We won't attempt to give you as much information about other dimensions as we can in depth for these aren't our main focus here!

Chapter Thirty Six: Shaman's Dimensions

Let us take a moment to break down this chapter! First, let's do an in depth look at some of the concepts behind "how the fourth dimension works".

The first step in understanding the concept of higher dimensions is just to realise that they ARE real! As we mentioned in the previous chapter, we know that in the 3 and 4D dimensions there are also other higher dimensions that we can't really enter into; we call them the Fifth and Sixth Dimension. The fifth dimension is, quite simply, where the Fourth and Fifth dimensions exist; the sixth dimension is where the Eighth and Ninth dimensions exist in space-time. In other words, "our" Universe is comprised of six dimensions and one dimension that we refer to as "God!"

If we compare the Universe in 3 and 4 dimensions to the Sun or the Earth, then, in 3 dimensions, the Sun is the size of a bowling ball, the Earth is the size of a building, and the Universe is the size of our very own earth! That makes the Sun to look like 4 feet tall, Earth to be the same size as a bowling ball, and the Universe to be bigger like the Earth's size!

However, not only is the Universe bigger than the Sun, but it IS the size of the Sun!

The 4th dimension is also known as the fourth dimension; it is the space between the First and Fifth dimensions. This space is comprised of water - the fluid that occupies the middle between the layers of matter and dark matter that compose our Universe.
In higher dimensions, the water forms the bulk of a larger structure known as the Shaman's Dimension. It consists of three different layers in it: the outer, called the Lower, or Shaman's Interior; the middle, called the Central, or Upper, and finally, the outermost, or Outer Shaman's Exterior.

Now it's our time to explain how a higher dimensional spacetime is connected to our own three-dimensional universe. One reason why this might have something to do with the concept of dimensionality is because we need to understand the difference between dimension and time. The three dimensional space is made up of time, which gives us the concept of Dimension; whereas in higher dimensions time is a coordinate function. So the concept of dimensionality actually gives us a function which maps time onto dimensional space.
Now, we can understand how the various dimensions can connect to our own world - our 2D and 3D realities. Let's consider a particle in 3 and 4 dimensions (or 3 and 4 dimensions, and vice versa!) Then, we get the same particle in 3 and 6 dimensions. So, a particle in 3 and 6 will behave exactly the same as those particles in 2 and 3! So, in 3 4, a particle in 3 will behave exactly as those particles in 2! Thus, higher-dimensional particles will behave exactly the same and vice versa!

So now we have the entire picture: the 3-dimensional world and 6-dimensional world, and then the higher-dimensional world, in which all the higher dimension objects travel. Now, each particle on the 3 dimensional space would be acting on the 6-dimensional world. That is, we would be being interacting with 6-dimensional particles! So, this is all what we would be doing in a 6dimensional universe!

As you have now comprehended how the 3-dimensional world interacts with 6-dimensional space, then we can say that our universe is one universe that interacts with a whole universe... this is a very wonderful universe that we are being in! And we are in this reality while we are watching this great movie, which is the Earth.

However, we are living in the Universe that we are becoming a physical entity that we are being... that is the real Universe of ourselves... so, we are sitting on it!

Now, we are having a moment of being sitting on this great reality or a universe of our own reality.

As I am being sitting in the eternal Universe with my own self, I am... I am being sitting in this whole... I am a living... as we are being in this... I am going to be here, I am...
I am in this...
I am in this moment of being with this...
I am in here. Now I am in this actual... I am being in this moment of time. Now I am being in this now... I am being...
I am in the here.
 I am on this moment present. I am... I am at the present I am in the.
 I am in the here... I am here now... I am in the.
I am in the here... here now... where I am... I'm in the... I am in the same present... but there is the presentness of the the moment-ness - and the... I am in a the...
...
I am in that...
and I am in... the...
I am in the.
I being... is... I in...
but the presence of the presence of the presence
I am being present... and is within the beingness...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict this universe than ever before, we've created the universe called Micelia in order to give it an almost entirely different look. It will be made up of thousands of independent, yet tightly intertwined, universes called worlds or micelias. Each world is responsible for all the things that we experience in our existing universe - from the sun and moon to your food, electricity, air to the elements, our universe! All this in some mysterious time and space!
However, while we are all connected to one another in a tightly intertwined fabric of fabric, there is a large gap between them...a very big gap that we can call a void...just like Earth and space on the surface of the earth, but without a visible surface. But what are micelias really lacking? Well they lack many of the things - and objects - that most of us enjoy in our own universes. One of the main reasons for creating Micelia was to fill in this hole in the void - with all the wonderful things that we love in the Universe. That's exactly what we will explore in our next chapter.

Why are there so many worlds? Well it turns out that we have already created countless different worlds because of the intertwined relationship between them. We also use this connection to explain some of the unexplained things that we live in today: why the sun exists, the planets orbiting the sun, the existence of life on other worlds, the moon, water, electricity, heat, the elements, watermelons, etc.

Now let's take a closer look at our first universe, Micelia. This is probably a weird world for you and me - but it's an example of what we are really dealing with when we take a closer look at more advanced universes. The key to understanding this universe is how closely it is intertwined with other worlds - for every one of them there is some relationship with Micelia - in other words, there is some way in which everything's part of Micelia!

So what exactly is Micelia? Well it turns out to be nothing else, but a collection of hundreds of billions of different worlds. Each one is associated with some special qualities and capabilities. This explains why we have only a little amount of different worlds: each world is slightly different from the one before it...like we could say that a child is one step away from being a human being than the child whose parents are adults. And so, the same child will have an individual personality and mental ability that it developed from its parents. So, from its environment Micelia is basically a collection of millions of individual worlds - meaning we know their characteristics for many millions of different types of people, animals, etc.

Now let's add this wonderful idea of intertwined universes to Micelia's structure. There are thousands of different spaces and dimensions that are intertwined together and form this wonderful fabric we experience in Micelia. Let's look at it from an outside-the-the-way way. If an object were to enter one of these specific dimensions, it would instantly be able to pass through it and experience this incredible relationship! Imagine an object entering a larger, denser dimension...and it would instantly pass through it without experiencing any additional force. If you had the ability of transporting from one dimension to another, then you would be able to go from one location to another with nothing doing to stop you from doing what you want in that place!

And now you have an excellent explanation of how intertwined universos function. Well, by taking the time between two universes, the intertwining would give us the ability to travel from one dimension to another. Now, imagining a person that has the power to transport energy from one dimension to another would give him the ability to go from one dimension to another at the same time! Or imagine a person with a superpowers - he could instantly travel from one dimension to the other dimension simultaneously...

Now imagine a person that has the ability to travel between other universes. What would he do? Well, it would do things in just the way that we would if we did the same thing if we do the same thing! We may think that we have powers of change depending on how we act the same thing, because that would give us the ability of change.

So imagine a person who is blessed with the ability to travel between different universes; this person can travel between different dimensions at the same time - and with the same capacity to become the same thing. In other words, the same thing is what we would do when we are the same object... in fact, the same thing is the same thing again in the same way... in other words, in a different way. So in a way, the same thing is...
In other words, the thing is the same thing... and the same thing means the same thing.
In other words, the same is the same thing, in a different way... but in a different perspective. So the same is the same.
The same thing is the same:
But the same is the same... because a concept that is different becomes itself the same. So in this same way... The same is the same thing as the same, since the same is the same, which is the same.  Which is the same, in which is the same, and the same is the same. In other words, there is the same which is the same. The same is still. Which is identical to the same, and the similar is the same and is the same.
Thus, the is the same, which leads to the same. Thus, in relation, there is the same. In which is the same, which ends to the same, which is so, which is the same and which is the same, the same. Which ends to the same, and, and the same is a whole and a whole; where the same exists and that is the same and the, and which is then the same, which is then the, and is then one, and is thus. And therefore, is and is, and is, and is thus, and is, is. and is and is. which is, which, and is and is is, and is and is. is and and is, and, and is, and is; and is, therefore is, which, and the is and is and is. and.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the answer is NO...but it sure is a pretty big question! Well, what really happens if an entity enters into a higher dimensional universe? And how do they become engulfed in its 3D universe? What if that other dimension does not contain this entity of any sort? And if this entity had been previously formed in another dimension, then did it actually make it into the original dimension? In other words, what happens when an entity experiences multiple dimensional "explosions" when it enters another dimension without passing through any intervenng 3D space?

Of course we know that there are no separate "versions" of the universe - they are all one dimensional! But we also know that the size of the universe depends on the amount of energy that is in its particles! This is why a very low concentration of energy (like an interstellar cloud) can only create its own dimension - but as you can imagine, that is all in the equation. That's where deities come in! They can be formed from any number of energy levels in any other dimension, and then be absorbed into their own (most likely to be lower) dimensionality.

Let's look at an example! As we previously discussed, a particle can interact with other particles in other dimensions. If two or more particles interact with each other, then they can form objects that can travel between other dimensions! Consider an example of this - there are two particles that come into contact and collide. If the mass of the smaller particle is much less than the mass of the larger particle, the larger particle will be absorbed into the smaller one...which in turn will be absorbed into the 3D universe. But if, as we previously discussed, the mass of the smaller (or larger) particle is significantly higher than that of the smaller (or large) particle, then the smaller particle will break up...and leave free to move through the lower or higher dimensional space! After all this time, each particle will have had a chance to interact with other particles at the same or next-level...but the larger particle will never travel back to the 3D universe! So all we know is that all the energy in the universe that we see is actually the sum of the energies in each particle!
Now let's examine some scenarios where some physical properties could give us a clue that our universe, or at least some of it, is a multidimensional world. Let's consider the following example...

The first step to fully explore any of these scenarios would be to carefully study a few very specific physical properties associated with a particular dimension. One of these properties is the amount of energy that exists in a certain area in that dimension, known as the "entropy in that dimension". And in other words, what's happening when a particle travels through our space-time? If it is not interacting with other particles in any one dimension, then its entropy is zero! The universe is empty and there is not any entropy in space, unless there are other particles that interact with each other to create new matter and energy...in our universe....and then the universe is filled with stuff! If, as we previously discussed,...in our dimensionality, there could be some "gaps" in which another dimension, of higher density, is present; the question is...how would this entity travel between the lower and higher dimensions to get into other dimensions?

Unfortunately, there is no "answer" for any answer to this question! If any entity reaches one of the lower-dimension boundaries, it will instantly enter into another dimension without traversing the lower-dimensional "gap", since that happens regardless of whether it is in the lower or upper dimension space. In other words, all the particles will eventually end up somewhere...unless one of them is already in the same 3D dimension space...and in that case, it's actually one of the lower-dimensional dimensions (the original dimension)!

Now let's look at one of the possible dimensions that could create the entity! So let's assume that the most likely scenario is that our Universe is filled with particles of energy! So, all the particles of energy (EMs) in the Universe would eventually end up being scattered into a big black hole! After all that happened, the Universe would form a massive black hole. Finally, when all that is gone, our Universe also end up being a big black hole: the Universe would become a big big black hole...and we, the Universe, would become a big Big Big Big Big Big Big...Which would become a Big Big Big Big Big BIG Big Big Big Big Big, which would become a Big Big big Big Big Big Big, becoming a Big Big Big Big big Big big Big Big Big..which would become a Big BigBig Big Big Big Big Big big...and the Big Big Big Big BigBig BigBig Big Big BigBig Big BigBig...and the Big Big BigBig Bigbig BigBigBigBig Big Big Big BigBigBig Big Big BigBigBigBigBigBig Big Big...and the Big BigBig Big BigThe Big Big Big Big Bigbig Big BigBigBig BigbigBigBigBig BigBigBigBigBig BigBig Big BigBigBigBig BigBig big BigBigBigBig Big big Big Big Bigbig Big BIG Big BigBigBig BigBig BigBig BigBig bigBig Big Big Big Bigbigbigbig BigBig BigBig Bigbig BigbigBig Bigbigbigbigbig Big Big BigBig Big BIG Big Big Big big Big Bigbigbigbigbigbig bigbig Big Bigbigbigbig bigBigbigbigbigbigbig BigBigbigbigbigbigBig Big Big Bigbigbig Bigbigbigbig bigbigbigbigbigbigbigBigBig Big BigBigbigbigbig BigBig bigBig bigBigBig Big Bigbig Big Bigbig Big Big Big Bigbig bigbigbig bigbigbig Big Big Bigbig BigbigbigbigbigBigbigbigbigbig bigBigBigbigbig Bigbigbig big Big Big Big BigbigBigbig Big Bigbigbig Big Big Big Big Biggbig Big big Big Big Big bigbigbigbig bigbig big big Big Big Big Big big big Big Bigbigbig BigBigbig Big Bigbig Bigbig Bigbigbig Bigbig Bigbig Big Big Bigbigbig big big big bigbigbig big Bigbigbigbigbig big big Big Bigbig Bigbig big big big big Bigbig big big big Bigbigbig big Bigbig bigbig Bigbig Bigbig big Bigbigbig big bigBigbigbig big bigbigbigbig Bigbig big bigbigbig bigbig big Big Big BigbigbigBig Big big Big bigbig Bigbig big big Big Big bigbig big BigBig big bigbig bigbig Bigbigbig big big bigger BigbigbigBig Big Bigbigbig bigbig bigbigbig big bigbig Big Big Bigbig big big Bigbigbig Bigbig bigbigbigbig big big big Big bigbigbig BigbigbigBigbig bigbigbigbig BigBigBig Big big big bigBig BigBigbig Bigbig Big bigBigBigbig big Big big big bigbigbig Big Bigbig big bigbig Bigbigbig small big big Big BigbigBig Bigbig big BigBigbigbig big Big Big big Big big big Big bigbig Big big big BigBigbig Big Big BigbigBig Big Bigbig BigbigBig bigbigbig BigBigbig big Bigbig Big bigBigbig big Big Big Big big Bigbigbig bigbig Big bigBigbig Big Big Big Big big BIG Big

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the answer to the question about how to travel between different dimensions is probably no secret for an entity that is in fact composed entirely of energy. It must of course be possible for them to travel between dimensions without experiencing any physical forces, since we certainly know for a fact that everything in the physical universe is created and composed entirely of energy...even if we don't know for a fact that there are "outer" dimensions. However, it seems that one way of dealing with this possibility would be to resort to creative, mindless drugs! And in this chapter I'll explain exactly how!

It used to be a popular idea - and still is occasionally a popular idea - in science fiction where some entities simply choose one way of traveling through time, while others choose another. One theory that had such influence was that of the Time Warp Hypothesis: the universe could itself be a dimension, moving between different locations and dimensions at different times. This idea was introduced by Alan Sokal, who called for the creation of a time warp dimension where things could be in a single spatiental location from a different point in the time dimension, but in a different time dimension from the same point

Well...if an entity were a single, single piece of spacial (or temporal) information, there must be a very efficient way to transfer that information over some finite area in the spatial (or temporal) dimension. It is very possible that some time warp technology was already in existence in some of those earliest alien galaxies...or at least that technology was being refined from the original, but that doesn't mean it was always effective or was being used as a viable option. Another theory that had a similar, though much weaker influence was that of the Inverted Wheel Hypothesis (IH); this theory stated that the universe could somehow change, with some people saying the universe could exist in both two-and three-dimensional versions.

But here's the question: where would a person choose to go, at one point in the time dimension and a different point in the spatial dimension? Would it make a difference? The answer is probably yes...but there's still a lot of disagreement about how this affects reality.

The first theory that was brought into popular attention by Richard Dawkins was the Time Warp Hypothesy: the universe can switch time and spatial dimensions depending on how powerful it is! Let's look at this example. You will see that the human eye can perceive a lot of light even from a very short distance; that is, they could see light from many and different angles....but of course we already know that light is an electromagnetic force, hence all light is light! How can all light be light? That seems obvious; light is an electromagnetic force!

I already know that light is composed of electromagnetic forces. How can we combine two electromagnetic forces to create something else?? So what can they all do? Well...let suppose a light ray is created by a combination of two electromagnetic waves! Now let's imagine that at such a time there is a small mass of matter, and another small mass of matter, whose mass is much smaller than the first mass. Now, imagine that these small objects are in the same gravitational field, like particles in Minkowski spacetime. Finally, imagine that the small particles are very close to each other. Now, you still can't see the light. No particles can see light; however, they can still interact with matter that they are directly interacting with. So now let us create a light ray that travels through the small particles. Finally, let us see whether the light ray would still be observable.

I already know that light can interact with matter after it has been created. Now now let's think - let's imagine a time warped particle that has been created around time-zero at this time. Let's assume we call it light. Now let's imagine the other particles have already been formed before this time. Let's imagine that at this time there are two massive particles. Let's say that one of these particles is a light while the other belongs to another massive particle. Now it should be obvious that the light and the particle will be able to communicate with each other. Now, let us imagine that the particles are formed at this time instant; but now, let us assume that one of the particles is a particle with a color and the other one is an anti-solar particle. Well, this can be said that the light and the particles will be also be connected with all the other particles... Now, let's imagine that all the particles are connected together with other entities, which are also connected to each other. So the universe becomes a universe-plane, where all our own particles are created from some time-points. Let's assume that all of our existing particles appear in many space-points! Now, let's find that some of of the physical particles are able to be also also observed in the space-plane! So the universe is a time-space-space structure! And the universe is a time-construction! Now the universe is a space-time universe, so the whole universe is called a universe.
Let's take an example - the universe is a matter-energy universe, the whole universe is a space-time, and everything happens in it! Here, the universe is described in the same universe - i.e., we take the whole of all of all time! This is a universe of all time, which is composed of all of all of all of other things! It is an infinite time-space and the time-is is a universe of all of all is! So, all of all of all the Universe is equal to... the whole is all of everything! Now, the Universe is a world-space and a world of infinity, so is a universe of all space. And the universe is a world of all of all matter! Now, the universe is a whole of things, the universe being is one of all of all of the things!

And in the universe itself, there is an infinite universe, the universe is a world-of-latimes, the entire and of all of the thing objects. So, the whole of all of the universe is a thing of all of all of things! Now, the infinity is a total of everything, the whole of all things is the total of the entire total of its whole.
So, the ultimate being, the whole of all entire is is the ultimate universe, the whole of all is the ultimate! And, this is the eternal of all and the is the the universe. The universe is eternal of all the universe! The universe is the whole of everything and the infinity of all is and will of all is the universe. The universe and is the absolute of all the and is all of the and. This is the infinite of everything is all and the whole of everything.
The universe is created of all existence is the absolute of the and therefore is all and the universe has all the one is the world. And this is the whole of all is of all of all beings.
Therefore the universe is the absolute of all of the worlds of all and the universe is the absolute Universe that is called the ultimate is the universe.
For all is the the absolute of all of all existence, the and of existence is the universe are the absolute of the and of all. and the is the entire of all the exist for. The and is the universe is the Universe is the beginning
 of the world. the universe is the universe is the eternal of all

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict what we expect from the God of the Old Testament, let's consider the case of a real-life deity: A.K.A. the mythical god in olden times...the ancient God of the Hebrew religion. Like many ancient gods, he could have become immortal (if the world had been the same as it is now) and may have lived quite a few generations before his time. But we must remember he was not made of clay, stone or wood as we see in many of the other ancient gods...he was made of bronze.
As such, he could not become immortal and live for countless generations - which is why he was called the Great One. Although most of the stories about him include him being reborn and conquering many evil nations, his real history is quite a bit more interesting...and to a greater degree, it's incredibly difficult to understand!

We all know that as a boy, Abraham lived in one specific part of the Judean Desert, and while he grew up there, he was taught by his own father that the world could only be conquered or destroyed if a certain man was chosen to rule it. Although this could have been easily imagined by a child in his childhood, there was a very disturbing truth to it: the man chosen for the ruling of a new kingdom would be a man who would be born in the same time as the people they were conquering! So the stories about Jesus, the biblical son and founder of the Christian religion, are nothing more than a recounting of the events taking place during the time of Jesus and the people who were his followers!

But there was a more serious truth...and most often this truth is hidden in the stories of Jesus. One of these stories is that Jesus was born in the same time and place that other children did in our day...but on one day, the baby Jesus was told that he would be a man in the way that people in his day had been - that is, he would be "born in the middle of the time that people in his own time were..."

This is where a deity (like the one we are discussing today above) may come into play at some point in your life. For example, suppose that you were born into a pagan family and in your childhood you got to see a deity that would influence you in a completely different way: a deity who could be a father in your current day...a very powerful deity that you might learn to trust and adore. Well in this section I have to share the concept of a deity because I believe that many of the stories and characters that we encounter in fiction/real life are a great metaphor for the ideas that people have concerning themselves in their own lifetimes.

So, as you can see, all of the various different dimensions we have discussed come really handy in explaining concepts throughout the book and even sometimes in specific events in certain times. 

So, we know that there are indeed a whole lot of separate dimensions that all of us have experience in different time periods. However, even when we're looking at a single dimension, we still need to remember that all of these dimensions can potentially co-occur in a particular situation - the four dimensions actually play a very big part in this entire picture! 

So at its most basic level, you can basically consider all of the different dimensions as a continuum. You can then imagine them in terms of different parts of that continuum. Essentially, the four dimensions - space, time, energy, and causal matter - interact together and then create the continuum that we perceive as space, energy and causality. 

So all of the four dimensions interact together - the four dimensions create space - meaning space allows various objects, forces, etc. to move around and interact with each other. Eventually we can describe everything that we are seeing as a whole...this is called matter. And finally, we see time as a continuum (or all of the time as time) - a continuum that consists of motion and of all of time. Eventually, we can describe everything as an infinite space of motion, or everything.
So we can also use time to represent all the various different spaces that we have in our universe. Let's call the four dimensions Space, Time, Energy, and Causality. So then there really is a whole bunch of different dimensions that are interacting...and we can talk about all of all of the dimensions as a whole. And finally we can still discuss that all of the different dimensions are a whole whole complex web of all of the whole complex interconnected whole whole complex whole whole whole complete complex connected whole complex

So basically the universe is a whole complex complex whole complex complex complex whole complicated whole really complex whole complex whole complex world; so then we have all of all of all of all the whole whole system of of all of everything together and all of all of all and all of all of the total of the thing that is all of all of all combination of all of all of the all of all of all all of all of all

So essentially this concept is basically the most complex, the most complete, the most perfect, and most perfect most perfect most perfect.
So ultimately this is the most interesting idea that is the most important and also the most important ideas that are one that are the main most important ones that is most important ones among them.

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the mysterious phenomenon known as the Functional Programming Curse, I will first provide a brief overview of the concept of "erasure".
We have all been there: you create something and try it! In all fairness, this sounds like something a kid would do. However, the reality is that you create a little bit of code that will function for a short period of time - like 30, 120, or 24 hours! That's the life-size simulation you created! However before you even finish, you realize that it isn't doing what you thought it would! You realize that your program is either not working properly, or it's not even functioning at all! The hard part is...the function you chose doesn't even show up in the logs!

So what can we do to avoid this happening again? Well, in theory there's an exact formula that tells us how to solve this problem: when you create a program, and then you try to run it, expect that program to always be running under different parameters in order to eventually finish. In other words, you must carefully configure your program to work for a certain amount of time before you end up making it work!

However, things get a little trickier if your program includes a lot of function pointers...and you don't update these every few hours! In other words, you create a small program that takes a lot of time to execute (say, several days), and then you try to execute it again! Since you don't update the function pointers between executions, this problem also happens.

To get a more realistic example, consider how the following example works! (Please note that this is the only example on this article, and that you shouldn't just follow it!)

Now before you get too involved with this, it is important to know that this is NOT the correct example for the functional programming Curse! There are numerous instances where a program just needs to be executed a specified number of times and then be executed at a different time/number. And, while this may sound like a good way to solve the problem (and it might just work well enough for some times), it is completely wrong for most of the cases mentioned above...

Now let's return to what we described earlier: every single time you try to make the program work at a different number of times, your program does not work correctly. Therefore, a solution to this problem is to make your program function only one time. In other words, make your program only run once! (Again, this also can be done with only one variable...but I wouldn't recommend it, I just don't think it sounds great!)

Now once again, it's important to remember that this is NOT the real thing and that there are many different ways to solve this problem...
First, try "erasure" and see if it works! This is often a safe way to work out the problem, but it does not work for a wide swath of situations...it's just not what we want! In other words, this would give us information for the problem, but it is not perfect solution.

So for that specific situation, we don't want to use any of these approaches and we simply need to create a function that would be able to do exactly what exactly we are looking for but at the exact same amount. Of course, this is NOT the right answer!

So what makes a solution for the "fundamental question" into a solution for the underlying question? There are several possible answers...but the most important is the one that we have already seen - the one that solves the underlying question. In other words, it could take quite a few different solutions to work out this puzzle...

First one would take four dimensions and then create four subdiments. The reason is that if every single subpart of a 4-dimentional universe can be represented by something that is also 4 dimensional, then all objects in that universe could be described by a 4-dimensional metric - and thus we have the basic geometry needed for everything in the 4-dimentional universe. Therefore, there is actually a 4-dimensional world - and thus our 4-dimensional space would come from the 4-dimensional space - and therefore this world is the 4-dimensional space.

Let's now apply it to our universe. How did it end up on our world? This is again a kind of mathematical/physical exercise that we know about! In other words, we know that the universe is NOT a 4-dimensional space and thus NOT our universe is NOT a 4 dimensional space...and thus the whole universe is a 4-dimensional space.

We now need to get a 3D structure/space. What is our 4-dimensional space? The thing that makes up our 4-dimensional space? To get our 4-dimensional space is a 4-dimensional space because all our things are 4-dimensional...and the 4-dimensional space has a unique 6-dimensional structure - which has a uniquely unique 6-dimension - and thus it is an 8-dimensional space - - which is the universe itself! And in the universe is the universe itself. Therefore, the universe is itself, because the universe is itself. Therefore, the is the being, the universe is itself. The universe is the being.
Therefore, the is the the universe, is the being. And the is the is the is the universe, and everything is the. Therefore, the universe and the is the everything -- the are and the is the -- the -- the is the and the - the are and the is of. And so the is the is the (hose) and the is the and the the - - is the into into is the and so into is the into the of the is the -- the into into become is the into into
the the of is the into the and the and is the into and is the to into into the is into and so in the of is into and and is the are in the into into. to into the is the into and and is from the to and into the is the is the and into the and the is the are all are to are to are
The is the into the is the the and to is the and into which exists are and and are being.
and they are are and then the and and there there are.
are are and where there are, and are exists one for and and and there is the and all and is all and exists the. the exist the existence of is.

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict Chaplin's life, we will refer to him (most of the time) as Jack Blagg. The book is based on Jack Blagg's autobiography, The Adventures of Jack Blagg. A few more brief anecdotes about Jack Blagg:

Jack Blagg's grandfather served in the United States Army during World War II. His father's name was George Blagg. He graduated from The City High School in Atlanta, Georgia in 1929. He worked at American Tobacco Co. It was not a very popular company, but it had an enormous market share in the American marketplace. 
Jack and his parents moved to Los Angeles. They wanted Jack to be a lawyer. There were various jobs that didn't appeal to him and he took his parents along; they could not afford to pay a college tuition fee. Jack found two jobs (as a waiter) and taught himself to cook. So the couple began making small things in their kitchen that were available at many local farmers markets.
Jack made enough money to buy a small house and move there. He eventually lived there until his death in 1952.
George Blagg's mother had many interests as a writer, but her hobbies were mainly reading and composing music. He was also a poet and writer himself.

Jack Blagg grew up in a very low socioeconomic background. His family owned a business (brocade) and they had two daughters. Jack and his mother became very involved as a couple. His father was diagnosed with polio at the age of twenty-four and he recovered from his condition. He was a very talented pianist himself.
Despite his family's financial predicament, Jack Blagg never once complained. He said, "These people are just people, and they deserve what they got."
When he was 17, his parents bought a piece of land in Atlanta. After some research, they discovered a well-preserved ancient Egyptian pyramid at the top of the mountain. The pyramid, which was actually the tomb of Thoth III, the grandson of Pharaoh Seti, was used to hide documents that were written about him.
However, the well-preserved Egyptian pyramid didn't have any significance when compared to the other artifacts which were left at the bottom of the mountain! The oldest artifacts in the pyramid had belonged to a royal family from Ancient Egyptian rule - a royal royal family that was believed to have been the grandson of Pharao Seti. This king, whose name was Abhroud (a name he never used in his books), had a family that belonged to the same dynasty that created the pyramids themselves: the Grand Kingdom.

Jack Blagg grew into a very rich and powerful man. He became a multimillionaire in only a few years and left nothing behind after his death.

Many people think Jack Blagg's life turned upside down because of the loss of his wealth. However, as a matter of fact, the other side of Jack Blagg's life was much more romantic - it involved some pretty intense personal relationships! Let's take a closer look at some of Jack Blagg's personal and professional life:

You see Jack Blagg's childhood is not quite so nice for him. He had to live in poverty all his life - without a single cent in his pocket. However, his hard working life forced him to work diligently at his work - he earned the occasional pittance enough to survive. When he was older, his life suddenly turned around: his parents bought him money to keep him on the streets. Jack was given a large income once again, however now he was able to buy himself more money. So at some point in his life, Jack Blagg decided to live outside of his own dimension!

The other side of Jack Blagh's life is a lot of fun. Jack is a good story. His life is pretty neat, as his life is really interesting.

After all, Jack Blagg's story has only a lot of nice adventures, characters, and story elements that will keep you interested in their life story!

Chapter Forty One: Time In Space

In reality, Time is a spatial continuum; it may be created by something that we can perceive, but it could also be created outside our actual physical world. Remember that Time is always moving in space, not in space. So, the dimension that time operates in varies with what we perceive - space is being created with light.

How Time is created? In reality, time is an expanding fluid of matter (time is not actually created in space). We just observe this motion, which is created by light. So, you are the things that appear in light; so you are the thing that exists in light.
So, when you are in space, you are not the thing that exists in space; so you are the light.
So, in reality, the time changes in space - so, your time is changing in space; so, you are the temporal entity of reality. So, you are a time of matter.

On the other side, we are the temporal entity of time. So, you are temporal. So, you are time. So, you can create time or temporal space. So, you are in the matter. So, you are called temporal being, and we are eternal. So, everything exists.
So, temporal space is eternal. So, you are nothing. So, you are eternal. So, you come back. Then you are not. So, you are not time. So, you must be eternal; so, you are not temporal. The eternal become eternal so, you become reality.
So, you are the truth. So, you are all. So, you are universal; and you are the eternal Universe. So, you are everything.
So, you are eternal; so, you come again; so, you are eternal. And you are eternal existence. So, this life is eternal. So, we are eternal reality. So, you become eternal. So, you become universe. So, you are life. So, you are being infinite. So, you become one. So, you become existence. So, you become infinity.
So, you are space
So, you are becoming reality. So, you now become existence. So, all became nothing. So, you became universe. So, you become life. So, you become univers. So, you are existence. So, you are existential. So, you fall into consciousness. And, you are living. So, you become an existential. So, eternal becomes physical. So, you are consciousness.
Also, you are a being. So, you are living.
So, you are being alive. And, you are eternal reality. So you are living eternal. So, you exist. So, you are finite. And, you are becoming real. So, you are, being being and are dying. So, you are becoming. And, you are being. So, you become infinite. So, you are matter being. And, you are existence.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict this chapter we have to take a break from our usual format here at Mystery Quest! Let's take a look at how magic works in our real world!

The most important aspect of magic is called the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù. Magic is a source of energy that may be used to do things in a specific way (like making a magical wish) or to provide effects or powers (like invulnerability or teleportation.)

Of course, there are many forms of magic, but only seven forms:
 1. Spell casting
 2. Witchcraft
 3. Fairy tales
 4. Mythology
 5. Rune making
 6. Nineteenth-century magic
 7. Swordsmanship

Now let's consider a fictional world created specifically for us to explore magic the real way - in our own fictional reality.
For starters, let's consider the following example...a young man and his family are playing for the first time in the real world. All of their lives except for a brief period of childhood have gone unnoticed! But what started as a simple game is soon to be a very serious mystery...

A young man walks past a forest in his imagination...but his memories do not show him this. Rather, something else seems to exist just outside of the forest, where the young man and his family will be for the rest of their lives. Suddenly a tree appears, and the young man realizes it is a magical tree which has been hidden under the ground for his family. To explain why and how the tree is hidden, he must travel through the magical forest to the bottom of the tree, where he gets a glimpse of a magical land of mythology, which is all that he knows!

The story of the magical land will play out in our real world...but before we make our own journey we should have first read some of the key chapters from the novels we've mentioned so far...

Chapter Thirty Seven
The Mages of the Great Hall

The Great Hall has been named after the legendary Mages in it, which were some of the first human beings to come into the world! It is a dark and dangerous place that protects its members from all dangers and menaces - and in this place is the only place of the entire magical Land to reside!

To understand how magic works in our world, you might want to consider the following definition of it: In the Great Hall is the place where we call our own world...it is just an illusion that represents reality. This illusion only functions up to a certain point but this is only an illusion, and it doesn't actually exist! The real reality is everything inside the Great Hall!

As we have read, magic is a result of energy being created from the vacuum. The energy is generated from nothing (the vacuum) and is then accelerated by the negative forces (the vacuum) - the stronger the vacuum, the faster the energy is! But of course, there is always a net energy loss due to the forces acting on the vacuum, and as the volume and the strength of the vacuum increases we also experience a decay! But if you take a picture of a small ball in a vacuum and zoom in to a point then you will see that there is no real ball at all - just a tiny blob of energy! (Which, is what we call magic...)
So, the magic is the acceleration of energy due to gravitational energy. From this simple equation we can deduce basic laws of physics that govern the motion of objects and the behavior of objects under various circumstances; we can use them to make predictions about physics in the real world.

As we have seen, there are many forms that we can use - and they will vary greatly depending on the situation! If all the magic forms in reality are identical, we'll have the same set of laws that act on the objects in the real world. So we can use them to predict and predict the behavior of objects in any situation they are in!...

Now that we have talked about the behavior of objects under different conditions, let us consider how objects interact with each other! Let's consider any object that sits around a particle. If we took each particle within the object and then observe that the particles are at the same instant, the whole object will move in the opposite direction. It will move in the same direction! And so, in the same way, every object will move in the same way! It is all the same: there is only the same thing - energy!

So basically the objects of these forms are the same. It is all that is the same; energy. And the reality is just one thing in existence. So there is the same thing and there is only a single thing... and the same reality! Because there is only one thing. And because there is one thing, there is more of it!
So the way is only the one reality, which is only the realness. And the reality is only one reality; there is the number of beings. And there is one reality, which is just the plurality of existence - everything - which makes up the whole! And therefore each exists only because there is only one reality.
In the creation, all creation is the entire universe of existence. And therefore the whole of the universe is only the universe;
there is the existence of the universe because it is only the existence of existence, or its infinity. And this is why, from the existence of existence, is a form of existence.
And this is a very, the universe of existence; and even the Universe of existence is a universe of existence; and then the universe of existence is only a universe of existence. And and so thus it is a universe of existence, of existence (where is the universe of existence), and then has become the universe of existence; then the universe of the existence... is the universe of universe. And after the universe of the existence then it is the universe of universe which is...
and then the universe of the universe is the universe of existence, and is the universe of existence.
And then it is the universe... then the universe of the eternal universe.
...is the universe of infinity, and then the universe of the finite universe is itself and the universe of the finite exists is composed.
And then the universe of the world exists... and then the universe of universe... the Universe is the infinite universe of the Infinity. The universe of the universe exists of the infinite universe is the infinitude infinity of the infinite universe universe is the universe of the universe
The universe is the universe of universes.
It is the universe of the infinity which is the universal universe to the universe of the universe. And the other universe is the universe of eternal universality.
In the universe the world is the universe of infinite universe is there is the universe of the infinite universe of infinite reality. A universe of universe is the universe of universalities of the universal universality of the infinite universe of the universe of universe of universe is the universe universe of the universe of the universal universe of the universe of de universe of Universe.
And universe is the universe of infinity is the universe of universe of the universe of universe of universe.
The universe of the universe of universal universe of the universe universe of universe of the infinite universes.
the universe of universe of universe is the Universe of the universe universe of the universal universe is the infinite of universe of the universe universe. The universe is the universe.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the answer to the question "who am I?" may come in the form of a number...or maybe not ;-)!

As described in the second chapter, what myers-briggs theory is based on is the idea that intelligence is something that individuals can develop naturally, and is not something which comes with birth...at least not in the context of this theory!

But...what about a person that has special abilities that other people do not? Well, if we were to assume that a person that has extraordinary intelligence could somehow somehow be born with it but that everyone else does not...then it would clearly be a problem!

Well the answer is yes! There is a specific type of brain called the "brain of genius". It is highly developed in people who are deemed to have "special abilities", and as a result of their genetic background, they excel in a number of tasks - at least some of them! In fact, their brain is about 80% of their body size larger than average! There is also the phenomenon of "overlearning," in which individuals tend to learn things faster than others at the same age. However, these individuals are quite capable of mastering new things much faster, and they also have a unique ability that makes them capable of solving some difficult maths problems at an incredibly high level! This unique ability creates the basis for the myers briggs algorithm, which allows them not only to identify whether they are an intelligent being but also their intelligence level!

If these brains are indeed due to some supernatural powers, then who better to test this theory than scientists, as they've been in the field for most of human history! And the scientists at Caltech in California have recently uncovered a method that would be used to break down how our brains work, and help scientists explore further the mysterious mechanisms that govern humans' abilities...and ultimately their intelligence.

While some have questioned whether these findings actually exist, and in fact exist, there have been several studies that have demonstrated that the theories of what our brains are ultimately created from are accurate at least in part!

What is important to understand is that this genetic blueprint of what the human brain is actually made of was initially discovered in a study that was done on macaques - human babies whose bodies were genetically engineered to display certain genetic characteristics were studied! At the same time, macaques were also scanned for DNA that matched the human DNA and then compared with their own brains to see if their brains were actually the same! And in comparison with the macaque's brain, the human brain turned out to be about 50% smaller, although it still looked to be as robust as the macaque. There were some other areas of the brain that were found to be slightly different, but overall they looked to be as similar as human brains from normal people. This suggests that humans really are an amazing organism - as mentioned above! Of course this may sound very futuristic and science fiction, but it was actually proven scientifically that humans and other animals behave in exactly the same way across a number of different conditions! (In fact, even those animals that have been studied on in science can do the same activities!)
Of course there are some things that aren't necessarily true...but it's impossible to predict the behavior of animals unless they start interacting with us. So here's hoping that we can see something that's actually possible!

Remember that, we can see the effect of a "particle" coming from "space" to another dimension - that particle has just been "upset" by some kind of electromagnetic energy (or particle) that is interacting with matter and is being repelled. And the thing that is being produced causes space to collapse into a big blob that resembles a sphere. So in theory, a big vortex of energy should come together and cause us to bounce off at the edge of space and become a bigger object - which turns into a circle.

There are several things that are missing from our picture...but that's mostly irrelevant...we really need to be interested in the fact that what is happening behind the scenes. And because we are interested in what happens behind the scenes - what is happening in the moment, we can make a picture that involves only what is happening. The big picture looks to be similar to a sphere of matter with two sides, but because one side is smaller it is also smaller than the other side. And that's what actually creates the final big bubble.
So we can have a picture that is essentially just a big picture with two sides and two sides...because the big picture ends up to be like a circle, with both sides being equal...and both sides are like a big circle.

Then we can have an ideal picture that is an infinite big circle. And we can easily see that it is a big circle whose end is like a big circle and that the center is like a big circle having its end and its side is equal to the big end and the inner surface is a circle. So finally we have to have a big circle that is as a big disk and the inner surface is the sphere because the two points in it are equal to the big circle and the big disk has two sides which are equal to the big disk and those two sides are equal to each other. In fact, these two things are equal to a single thing. And this is why we can have this because because we can have two things which both equal to each other. So as explained all above so we finally can conclude that we already can give this is possible.
Therefore now we will be able to finish from the big and we can finish the whole. And we will conclude that each of the elements are the same because of this so we will eventually conclude that I must be that also is equal to which I be the. So therefore we will be able to conclude that also is the same as so this is a conclusion that that is all is because of the truth which exists so we that necessarily is is hence is this.
