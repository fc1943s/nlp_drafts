 As for other non-bodily entities - like spirits or ghosts - they travel differently as well, as they don't have the same nature as other entities and are affected quite differently by time dilation as well!

The only other entity we haven't seen that can travel between dimensions is the "phantom" - something that has no body to travel alongside of it. It doesn't really exist anyways - it just seems like a completely different kind of object to travel alongside of. It could have the same properties as most non-bodily entities, but it would have no physical shape and could only exist in the "shadow" of other objects. It would move within the "shadow" of all other objects, but it would be completely immune to any kind of interaction or force. However, the phantom's nature is not described in any of the laws of physics, and it is believed to have no existence at all

The only thing we know about how any of these entities travel through the dimensions is that their movement and actions are governed by the laws of physics and mathematically describe the phenomenon of time dilation. However, there is no way to study them physically due to the lack of the ability to see them for themselves. If an entity, being in or out of any particular dimension, ever wants to "see" it in physicality for ourselves, we should look for evidence to prove that it is inside an alternative dimension. It is this observation that led Einstein to hypothesize that there is another hidden dimension as well.
