 This doesn't seem too difficult to believe, so why is it considered even a puzzle?

In other words, the simple answer is that Gods in general do not exist and that beings in general do not move freely in space. Consider this:

All beings in the 4D Universe exist within one dimension. I.e. they don't have a 3rd dimension. Therefore, if Gods exist in 4D Universes, they must either be one-way objects, or they do not exist. They are 2 dimensions lower than their own dimensionality! However, such an argument doesn't really explain why Gods don't exist in 3+1 Dimesions, or why we have to assume they do exist in 4D. Let's go back to our hypothetical Deity, which had four dimensions - a smaller than 1,000,000th of the actual dimension of the world!

And again...if Gods do exist, they must have a hidden dimension that isn't visible. This is one of the main reasons that godsmanship is believed in - someone is trying to explain how all existence is controlled by one supreme being that exists only in a dimension lower than their own. We have never heard of these deities come from dimension 4 - let's start there!

That's why godsmanship is a form of esoteric religion in which people seek the guidance of a single, powerful Being, which is 1,000,000 times greater than the number of people around us! This G-d did exist, but his real name is not known to anyone outside of 3+1 Dimesions; it is even unknown to our gods! His name was Rahu, and was the name of a huge planetary system that was far, far away and located in a galaxy that is nowhere near our own 3+1 dimensional universe!

So again...you really don't have to assume that a truly, truly great Being exists in Dimension 4! We have all heard of unidentified aliens who fly through the sky from unknown locations! And there are rumors of "Dimension Unknown" aliens from Mars who appear to be millions of light years away from the Earth. Of course, these sort of things are always less credible if they don't even happen - imagine if this supreme being was not ever found!

Personally, I've always believed in monstrous deities. There are countless stories that list Gods of all shapes and sizes - such as a "cloud" of air that travels in all directions; a huge, rumbling lion, and various giants to name a few! But just like the ultimate truth behind the constant hype surrounding aliens, I don't really want to believe such stories are true at all. All I know is that Gods in 4D Universes are very rare, and it's hard to imagine a single being in 4D Universe (and beyond that in our own dimension) - every fourth of billions of extraterrestrial beings would have to be far, far away.

Even more interestingly, while all humans come from a single primordial being (Rahu), each individual comes from an even smaller primordial being:  Rahu's four daughters. So let's not speculate - if we truly want to believe that all beings in 4D Universes have a true spirit and a unique and personal nature, then each of these four primordial being must be from a separate physical dimensionality and be created from totally different portions of their body! That is to say, a god from 4D Universes would literally be a copy of Rahu's daughters, who each would be created from totally different, full parts of their bodies!

However, if we really want to understand the universe, we must first understand the physical properties of what exists in it. The core of this discussion is the universe:

So the universe consists of galaxies, stars, neutron stars, black holes, and massive star clusters that give rise to smaller and smaller objects, and eventually result in actual forms of life such as you and me. You can find this in images like the Hubble Space Telescope or galaxy after galaxy of stars and galaxies on the entire surface of the universe, all just begging for us to check out! When I say "we," I'm not talking about the average human, but rather the geniuses who have made it all happen! One last time, when I say "we," I am not talking about humans on earth, or any lower level being, but the intelligent beings who make things happen in the universe!

Now back to the gods of our universe, all we know is that Rahu took the final stand against the forces of the demon Vishnu and then vanquished the Muktiratharas; the mythical four-headed demon that was trying to destroy the universe! Rahu stood against Vishnu and tore down the statues of Vishnu and his huge creation, Death. These majestic creation were simply the combined forms of the heavens, the earth, and the moon. If these megalithic figures were mortals, Rahu would have made their names be called "We the people" or even "We gods," but instead they were called "Universal Gods" because of the universality of all things - the galaxies, the stars, the planets, and all of creation.

Although Rahu conquered the four-headed demon and took down the supernatural gods in the movie Avatar, the earth was still threatened by an alien being known as Drakon; the dark android whom the Avatar protagonists come to fight. Rahu then sailed the universe until he met the ultimate being known as Vishnu in Central Asia (300 B.C.C.), where he joined the One-armed (or One-Powered) Bhumi and Thor in their domain of Shiva (the World), and together they ascended to the throne of heaven!

Now, how does the creation of the universe have come to exist? Well, the universe was created not by a single entity but by the intellect of the three divine planets (Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) that took over their physical bodies, forming a black hole known as the Black Hole of Event Horizon! When that black hole was created, Gods of 3+1 Dimensions entered it and created a permanent frozen state - something that could last forever if necessary!

So where is Rahu and the other three heirs of Rahu standing today? Well, they're happily living in their mystical place known as the Jeju Island, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, just off the coast of the Philippines!

Well...just like there are deities, there are godmakers! Godmakers stand by their creations and help to keep the creation from disintegrating because some amount of misalignment has taken place. As you can imagine, when one of the gods of 3+1 Dimensions comes to the Jeju Island, they all get to stand and watch his creation grow! The 12 gods in Juju Island are largely named after 12 different celestial beings - their names include:

The Triple Goddess - Kokini - is the goddess of Nature and Birth; She is the mother of the universe, and is the architect of all creation.
The Great Goddess - Rakhti - is the goddess of Intelligence; She is the creator of consciousness and the saviour of the universe.
The Goddess of Time - Brihadevi - is the goddess of the heavens and the sky, and the creator of fate and opportunity
