Yes, ultimately, the origin of humans and their relationship to animals is something that is entirely mysterious, but it is the foundation for our civilization. Of course, it doesn't have to be this way - there are other explanations for how human beings evolve. Let's now consider how these other theories relate to the concept of dimension.

Since there are such a large number of theories explaining the origin of humans, it may seem silly to look for a single theory that seems to have a coherent explanation for both humans and animals. However, there is one theory that has been around for about 70 years now and is still the basis for today's human civilization. This theory is known as Darwinism, and we'll review it now.

Darwinism has been around since Darwin published his book, The Origin of Species. In 1859, he noted that species are living organisms that are "adapted to survive in their environment in the long run."  And in 1970, biologists called it "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" (also known as "The Great Game.") The theory is not completely mysterious - in fact, it is very well documented in the literature. But it's a very complex idea, and we won't go into that here.

The key points in this theory are that

The genetic makeup of species is not fixed but evolves and continues to change over time
Human species evolve from non-human species to humans and vice versa over time

But the more we study this theory and find ways to use it to explain the origin of humans, we find we actually have more and more reasons to believe that this is a valid theory.

One thing we find interesting in this theory is that, contrary to what Darwin has predicted, human species have a clear genetic link to non-human species. If it were not for humans, there would be no differences in genetic make-up between any of the other animals we know today! This was really surprising to many people in the 1860's, but it has now become part of accepted science. It is even now used to predict the evolution of species in our present world!

One of the great advances in evolutionary biology was that we were able to use DNA sequencing to directly show this genetic link between humans and animals. Now that we have this genetic evidence, we no longer need to rely on evolutionary theory to explain why animals and humans come together. We can directly determine this by looking at DNA sequences between organisms and see how similar these are. It turns out that most modern human and non-human animals are identical to each other at the DNA level - all they need to do is have a similar genotype!

Now we can use this information to predict the evolution of human species. Let's look at an example. If we know that animals that live today were a result of the evolution of non-human species a few million years ago, then we can directly predict the evolutionary paths of the animals that live today - and how many of these species will evolve into humans! This is done by examining DNA sequences between the species to compare their degree of similarity. And it turns out that almost all the modern humans in the world today are perfectly close to each other at the DNA level - and this close similarity is due to the common ancestor of humans being a large, open catfish! This is a good example of how a simple theory can be used to understand the origin of the human species!

How this helps explain the origin of humans, and why these species are so close to each other, will hopefully become clearer in the next chapter.

Tower of Babel

What do you make of this verse? Do you believe that the Tower of Babel existed?

It's hard to argue with the fact that there is this beautifully constructed structure - complete with columns, walls, towers, and so on. This is where the Bible says we should believe in the existence of God. But how could this tower ever have existed?  Is it just a fantasy? The answer to that question is probably not. Well, there is a theory about it that allows us to explain this paradox!

In ancient times, one of the ancient civilizations of the time was known as Babylon - a great city on the bank of the River of Babylon. It was in this city that the

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the best way to understand a concept that is so strange to us all is to examine it from the perspective of someone else. This is the most satisfying and rewarding experience of all: understanding a subject that is otherwise beyond our comprehension!
Let's take the following example: let's assume you have an imaginary deity who is a giant human with a body that is extremely flexible. So what if you consider this deity as having 5 dimensionality? Suppose you consider it a category of all humans who are extremely flexible and who also look like our imaginary deity. This would make it a 6D category: humans extremely flexible!

Now let's look at how this would affect the way your imaginary deity behaves. Suppose you ask him to play some sort of music instrument - let's imagine a very simple piano - and if he says he doesn't know how to play it, you might be inclined to assume that he doesn't have the right kind of instrument! However, suppose you think this is because he doesn't understand the concept of dimension and that he/she does not have the right musical sense! This would also lead you to conclude that he/she is simply a goon who does not understand what goes on in the universe! This is clearly not the case! In fact, the music instrument of our imaginary deity is clearly a different form of music in 5D spacetime: piano! Not to mention, our imaginary deity is a deity that is extremely flexible and mobile!

So what does this imply about us? Well firstly, it shows us that our imaginary deity can understand the concept of the concept of the 5D universe. In fact, it seems like our imaginary deity (and the humans in the 5D category of his/her existence) don't even have the right musical sense. Now if we continue this analogy, we can apply this concept to a variety of objects in our daily lives - for example, a very wide variety of human-made objects! For example, let's assume you have a very wide variety of small human-made objects with a wide variety of different textures and sizes. Then what if we considered each of these objects in 5D spacetime? This would give us all the kinds of 5D objects we have! In this way, we would have everything from a small human-made beaver that has a wide variety of different textures and sizes, to a very wide variety of different types of human-made animals that would be very difficult for our imaginary deity to handle!
So here is where our imagination starts to take over! We need to begin to think about the concepts and ideas our imaginary deity already has in mind. We need to begin to consider things from his/her own perspective! In fact, it may be even more interesting than our imaginary deity...who knows?

Finally, let's consider how this category theory for goons affects the way our imaginary deity would respond. Imagine that we consider our imaginary deity as being extremely flexible. Now that is going to make him/her extremely mobile...or rather he is becoming mobile! So why doesn't he just jump right into the sky? Why does he come out of the water and go back to the earth? Well since his/her body can be very flexible, he is capable of taking very different forms depending on how he/she is interacting with the environment, as well as the type of objects he is interacting with! In fact, if we consider our imaginary deity as being extremely flexible, then he could move and change dimensions freely from one place to another! Of course, in some respects, this would be very weird: we would have an imaginary deity that is flexible and extremely mobile all in one person! But from a more practical perspective, it would probably make the situation considerably more entertaining! So in a sense, we have successfully made an imaginary deity that moves and changes dimensions through physics without ever changing his/her identity! How cool is that?

What if We Knew We Wanted to Die...But Were Alone?

This chapter discusses how being alone can be much more enjoyable than simply being dead! This is based on the study of a series of experiments conducted by Michael Blanket and his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). What they found was

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the concept of nipples is only a fiction invented by humans; they aren't real. Why are people so attached to them? What has all this to do with how a mammal moves around inside its body? Why do humans tend to focus on a female's nipples and not those of a male mammal?

We know that mammals have nipples. Most mammals actually have nipples (not just mammals!) - all sorts of animals have nipples. One of the most popular mythological creatures known to humans, the goat - although not the only goats - does have nipples! These are really interesting...but that's not the point of this chapter!

Let's look at how mammals move around inside their bodies in simple terms. To move through their bodies, animals need to use something called their limbs - muscles that act as guides for them in the process of moving through space. These muscles help guide an animal to travel through its body by providing a guide line - the limbs will provide a guide that guides a muscle's movement through the body. So how would an animal move its limbs - what muscles are used to do this? Well, there are several types of limbs, all of which serve a particular function. In general, the more unique and useful the type of limb is, the more muscles it will use to perform that function. However, for each type of limb, the muscles that perform the particular task will differ depending on the limb and the animal.

Now let's consider what happens when a mammal moves through its body. As noted above, each limb carries a muscle to help guide it as it moves through its body, creating a circular path. So how do the muscles move along this path? The muscles are connected to a nerve, and the nerve acts as a motor nerve. When the nerve is triggered by an electrical pulse, then the muscles begin to move, generating power to move the limb as it moves through the body.

Now this could seem like a rather silly exercise to do if the subject was human. However, it's the role of humans as animate beings that makes it so fascinating to us. Humans are made of energy, which gives us the ability to move around in our bodies. We also have muscles that act as guides. But these muscles are made of muscle fibers, and muscle fibers contain energy. If you take a bunch of muscle fibers and force them into an arrangement so that they bend in a particular way, then they will produce a movement - this movement is called a muscle contraction. Thus a mammal is able to use its muscles to move around inside its body. The question is: what if the muscles and nerves used for moving the limbs were completely independent? This is what happens when the limbs are actually split down the middle: these tendons, which are the nerve connections, are actually split off and are not connected to the muscles anymore. But instead they are attached to the limbs by another type of fiber known as fascicles. This allows the limbs to work independently from each other, making them function as a single unit.

What if all of the muscles in a mammal were connected to all the limbs by a completely independent network of fascicles instead? How would this affect the animal's ability to move its limbs? Imagine an animal that would be unable to move its limbs due to lack of fascicles. In this situation, it might still move its limbs through its body, but it would be unable to do so as a cohesive unit and would experience "aggressive" movement that would be different from that it would normally experience.

So let's consider what happens if all of the muscles in a mammal are broken down - and not all of them. Imagine a mammal that is completely split into two: one of its limbs would be completely missing, and one of its arms and torso would be left behind. In this situation, the mammal would no longer be able to move its limbs. But it might be able to move its arms and torso - it might be able to do so as a separate limb - but it would have lost one of its primary functions - it would be unable to move its limbs.

In summary, it seems like if you are able to create a split human body - in which one limb

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this concept, we will need to consider a few factors - what are the best math skills for us enfj? How do the math skills you currently possess relate to your enfj characteristics? And finally, is there a way to use the math skills we currently possess to learn how to read a deity?

Mathematics is a very important aspect of our understanding of the world. In fact, math is the subject of many classes in high schools. But what exactly does math mean to us enfj? Why is it important to us?

It turns out that math is actually very much like science, in that everything in mathematics is basically scientific in origin. This is because everything we understand about the natural world - including the structure of space, light, atoms, and electrons - can be studied from a mathematical perspective. And as we continue to understand these concepts from a mathematical perspective, we will be able to make up more and more complex concepts in a way that we never could before. In the end, math will become the basis upon which we build our understanding of everything else - and hopefully we'll be able to make sense of everything that happens in our lives!

Of course, the mathematical principles that exist in the natural world are only as good as their study in a mathematical way! The best way to understand and learn mathematical concepts is by applying them to real-world situations. In general, we need to know how to apply mathematics to solve problems, and most of our problems in life do involve mathematical concepts. And because mathematical concepts are easily applied to real-world problems, mathematicians have been working tirelessly to develop the skills necessary to apply them to real problems. And as we continue to work on these skills, the more and more complex mathematical knowledge we accumulate in our minds will enable us to predict many of the outcomes of real-life events!

Of course, math is a subject that we can't actually see or manipulate directly, so we'll need to learn how to read and comprehend deities in order to be able to apply them to real-world situations. And remember...math is a very important topic for anyone - including you enfj!

Now let's take a moment to define the various types of math skills you currently possess. These skills include:

Algebraic
Arithmetic and Number
Calculus and Number Theory
Geometry
Probability
Statistics and Statistics

Now let's look at the link between your enfj characteristics and the different types of math skills. If you consider yourself enfj, you have the following math skills...and these are just some of the important mathematical characteristics that we need to consider. However, there are many more things that can affect how well you will be able to understand deities.

Math skills are a critical component of our ability to understand deities in general. As you will see from the link below, every type of mathematical skill that we possess are directly related to our enfj characteristics and, therefore, to our ability to understand deities.

What are the most useful math skills enfj?

Algebra
Arithmetic and Number
Calculus and Number Theory
Geometry
Calculus

What are the most useful math skills not enfj?

Probability
Statistics and Statistics

If you think of the enfj characteristics as math skills, then the following are the types of mathematical skills that are not enfj...and they are not good for you enfj...

Probability
Calculus
Statistics

You also need to note that there is a link between the type of math skills you currently possess and the level of importance you place on these skills in your life.

If you are a beginner with little or no experience, you would probably not value the mathematical skills that are most useful for you. On the other hand, if you already possess some mathematical skills, you would probably think of the most useful mathematical skills as those that are most important to you. In other words, if you possess some good skills, you would use these skills in ways that are most useful to you, whereas if you don't have any good skills, your use of mathematical skills would be limited and, therefore, not helpful.

If you take a closer look, there are some mathematical skills that are generally considered to be the most useful for enfj, whereas there are a

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive functions that mathematical entities play out, we need to know how mathematical entities map onto each other. For this we have the enwiki, which is a wonderful place to start! To better understand this, we first need to define what a mathematical entity is.
Since a mathematical entity is not physical in nature, its dimensions are not fixed. Instead, the dimensions of a mathematical entity are dependent upon a series of rules that determine the dimensions of different mathematical entities - specifically whether we wish the mathematical entity to be 2D or 3D.

Let us first look at enwiki! Since the definition of a mathematical entity is dependent on a series of rules, we can classify these rules into a set of categories. Some examples of these categories include:

The type of mathematical entity (e.g., a function, a property, a set, an element,...). 
The size (e.g., a number, a fraction,...).
The shape of the mathematical entity (e.g., a circle, a triangle, a square,...).
The number of dimensions of the mathematical entity (e.g., 3, 4, 7,...).

Let's take a look at how these categories map onto mathematical entities - let's say that our primary concern is with the definition of the mathematical entity.

What is a mathematical function?
Let's look at the rules used to determine the dimensions of a mathematical function. One of the rules is whether the mathematical entity has a fixed dimension or whether it has a variable dimension. Let's see which type of mathematical function has a fixed dimension.

If the mathematical entity is a function, then it can be expressed in terms of its parameters (numbers). The more parameters that we specify, the higher the mathematical function will become in complexity. Now let's look at enwiki!

What is a mathematical element?
If the mathematical entity is an element, then it is represented by some sort of abstract data in the form of a mathematical function. Let's look at enwiki! Now let's see the rules that specify the dimensions of a mathematical element.

What is a mathematical property?
If the mathematical entity is a property, then its dimensions are determined by some set of axioms that define the properties of the mathematical entity. Let's see which set of axioms makes up a mathematical property.

What is a mathematical element?: The set of rules that make up a mathematical element that can be transformed into a number. This set of rules determines its dimensionality: a) number of variables (e.g. n) b) cardinality (e.g. n.size) c) order of values (e.g. n.size)

What is a mathematical function?: The set of rules that make up a mathematical function that can be transformed into a number. This set of rules determines its dimensions: a) function name (e.g. f) b) parameter count (e.g. f.length)
What is a mathematical element?: The set of rules that make up mathematical elements that can have any set of dimensions. These dimensions can range from a single dimension to a function (e.g. 3 x 3). Let's see the rule used to determine the number of variables in a mathematical element.

If the mathematical element is not a mathematical element, then it is represented by some abstract data. Let's see the rules used to determine the dimensions of a mathematical element.

What is a set of variables?: The set of rules that make up a set of variables. Let's see the rules used to determine the dimensions of a set of variables.

What is a variable?: The set of rules that make up a variable. Let's see the rules used to determine the dimensions of a variable.

What is a set of variables?: The set of rules that use a set of variables to determine the dimensions of a set of variables.
What is a variable?: The set of rules that use a variable to determine the dimensions of a set of variables. Let's see the rules used to determine the cardinality of a set of variables.

What is a variable?: The set consisting of a set of variables and the rules that apply to determine the dimensions of a set of variables.

What is a set of variables?: The set consisting of a set of variables and the rules that specify the dimensions

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of our own reality, we can use mathematical symbols and formulas to represent our experiences. In particular, we can use mathematical expressions to represent the mathematically precise things about our lives that we find fascinating! So let's start with numbers...

When you buy a car, for instance, you might see the exact price that it is asking for - this is a piece of data that we're used to seeing, so mathematically we could create an expression that said "Buy this car today" and then use this number as our starting point for the journey we will take with our car. Since you have the exact number for your purchase, you can use this value to get a better sense of what the future looks like.

As well as the fact that we can visualize these numbers, they provide information about both the past and the future. For example, in order to predict the future, we might want to know how the economy is going, or we might want to make a comparison between past and future events. So we'll use the mathematical representation known as a graph to describe this in more detail...

Let's start with the graph below for the US Economy. This is the most widely used graph in Economics, and shows the GDP per capita for every country in the world. We'll use this graph as an example to show the concepts that we'll be exploring in this chapter.

Let's start with GDP and let's start adding up:

GDP = (Total income - Social security costs) * (Total expenditure - Public debt)

Now, how do we calculate total income?

Total income = Gross income + Interest and Capital gains

We could also include Social Security Costs or Public Debt (a little less popular) as a third component. But it doesn't really matter which one we use - we can use each component for our calculations.

Let's add up:

Total income = Gross income + Social security costs + Public debt

This is easy - we know how to divide things up. In Economics, we could even add the interest rate to the total income - so we know the price that someone paid for their cash...and if you like to make a joke about it, we can add in some taxes - but that part of the game already covered in previous chapters.

Similarly, we could also add up the total expenditure component.

Total expenditure = Gross income + Interest and Capital gains - Social security costs + Public debt

This is very important - the reason we have total expenditure and not total income is because there is a gap between the two numbers. This gap is caused by taxes, which are calculated based on the total income and are not considered in our calculations as part of the income. So to determine the total income, we need to subtract the gap, which we would call Social Security Costs.
When we add up total income and total expenditure, we find we have GDP.

GDP = (Total income - Social security costs) * (Total expenditure- Public debt)

Now, how do we calculate GDP?

Total income = Gross income + Interest and Capital gains - Social security costs + Public debt/Total expenditure

So, by calculating total income and total expenditure, we have calculated GDP - and that is what will be our starting point for this chapter!

Now about the interesting details of the graph...if you're familiar with the graph we just discussed, you may notice that we already have GDP. But what about other interesting data we might find useful at this point - which we won't be able to find using our existing approach? Well, in mathematics, we can represent such data using different symbols and formulas...

Let's take a quick look at this graph showing Total Interest and Capital Gains. Here are some of the symbols we can use to represent these data:

Now let us start adding these up!

Total Interest and Capital Gains = Total Interest + Capital gains - Public debt

Total Interest and Capital Gains = Total Interest + Interest rate - Interest rate rate * Total interest

This is easy - we know how to divide things up. In economics, we could even add the interest rate to the total interest rate - so we know the interest rate someone is paying for their money...and if you like to make a joke about it, we can also add in some taxes - but that part of

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts presented here, let's look at an example of a mathematical object. Let's call it Number 1. Now let's consider some definitions for the terms "number" and "number" with its opposite called "digit".

A number is a symbol to represent the sum of all of the elements in a given range.
Numbers are always written with a base of 2, but they are often written in many different ways depending upon the context. In our daily lives, we don't normally pay attention to these symbols - we often just think of numbers as a sequence of 1's and 0's.

Number is the number of items in the universe that we can put into a set of items.

When we think of a number, we usually think of the number of items we have in our minds, or the number of items in our computer. We don't normally think of a number as a physical object or object in a particular spatial location.

A digit is a symbol to represent the sum of all of the elements in a set of items. (We often just call it an "number" in our daily lives, but we might be less familiar with how this was originally used in mathematics.)

A digit is a symbol that only appears once in a set of items.

For example, if we have an empty set of four items, we will call them 2, 4, 4, and 8. The two-digit number 11 is another example - all four items have a different sum, so we should call them 11, 1, 1, and 1.

A digit and its opposite in addition add 1 and subtract 1 respectively.
A digit and its opposite in subtraction add 1 and subtract -1 respectively.

We can now understand why we would normally associate the term "number" with numbers and the term "digit" with the things we see in our everyday lives - everything from a 2 digit number (such as the number 2) to the number 11 (such as 11), is just a kind of symbol that represents all of the items in our set of items.

A:

Number 1 (11) is the sum of all 2,4,4,8.

You can calculate the sum of all 2,4,4,8 as follows:
 Sum of all numbers: 11

 Sum of all numbers with pair: 4

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complement: 4

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complement and complement: 8

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complement and complement and complement and complement: 11

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complement and complement and complement and complementary: 11

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complement and complementary and complementary and complementary: 11

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complement and complement and complementary and complementary: 11

 Sum of all numbers with pair and complementary and complementary and complementary and complementary and complementary and complementary: 11

 Sum of all numbers with complementary and complementary and complementary and complementary and complementary and complementary: 11

sum of all numbers with both pair and pair and complement and complement and complement and complement and complement: 11

sum of all numbers with both pair and complement and pair and complement and complement and complementary and complement and complement and complement: 11

sum of all numbers with complement and complement and complement and complement and complement and complement and complement and complement: 11

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we learn in mathematics, the following diagram will describe the relationship between the three different mathematical concepts of number, quantity, and geometric figure.

To learn about these different mathematical concepts and their relationships, let's look at the relationship between these three concepts as they appear in ESFJ textbooks. For example, the following figure describes the relationship between number and quantity - if the number "a" is represented by a circle on a line, the quantity represented by the circle represents the number. Similarly, the following figure describes the relationship between number and geometric figure - if the number "a" is represented by a triangle on a line, the quantity represented by the triangle represents the number.

To understand the relationship between these concepts, we need to see the diagrams in more detail. When one concept is represented by a circle, it represents the total number of times the given quantity has occurred throughout the entire process of producing the given quantity. Similarly, when one concept is represented by a triangle, it represents the total number of times the given quantity has occurred throughout all possible ways of arranging the given quantity into a triangle. By observing the relationship between each of the three concepts, we can get a deeper understanding of how these concepts are interconnected.

The bottom left of the diagram describes the relationship between number and quantity. As you can see, number is represented by the circle and quantity by the triangle. Let's now look at the following figure to understand this better!

The bottom right of the diagram describes the relationship between number and geometric figure. As you can see, number is represented by the circle and geometric figure by the triangle. This diagram makes a very powerful point: when one concept is represented by a circle, it represents the total number of ways that a quantity can exist throughout the entire process of producing the given quantity. Similarly, when one thing is represented by a triangle, it represents the total number of ways that a quantity can exist throughout all possible ways of arranging the given quantity. By observing the relationship between each of the three concepts, we can help our eyesight to see the connections between these three concepts even better!...

At this point, we can see how the three different concepts are connected to each other. It's important to note that the first time that the concepts are connected in this way is at the beginning of the first section of ESFJ's first class - a concept is only used once in the first section and then only after that concept has been taught again in class in the second section.

At this point, we have the concepts of number, quantity, and geometric figure connected in a very powerful way. We can use this same technique with every concept taught in class, but in our case we will use only the three concepts that we have previously studied - number, quantity, and geometric figure.

To understand how numbers work in mathematics, we need to know how they are represented in ESFJ textbooks - the three different representations. The representation of the quantity of a single number is always represented as a circle. Likewise, the representation of the total number of times the given quantity has occurred throughout the entire process or production of the given quantity is always represented as a triangle. The concept of quantity is represented by the circle and the geometric figure is represented by the triangle. By combining these three representations together, it is easy to see that the concept of quantity is a very useful representation for describing the total number of ways that a quantity has occurred during the entire process of producing the given quantity. For example, the total number of times a single number occurs throughout all possible ways of producing the given number is always represented by a circle.

Similarly, the total number of times a single quantity has occurred throughout all possible ways of arranging the given quantity into different figures is always represented by a triangle. The geometric figure is always represented by a circle. By combining these three representations together, it is easy to see that these three concepts are very useful representations for describing the total number of ways that different geometric figures have occurred during the entire process of producing the given figure. For example, the total number of ways that a single geometric figure occurs throughout all possible ways of arranging the given figure is always represented by a triangle.

It's important to note that this is not the only way that we can represent the

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we are trying to teach students with, this chapter will include links to the following topics:

Concepts in ESFP mathematics

Mathematics: basic concepts
Mathematical expressions
Conversational language
Mathematical representations
Symbolic calculation
Mathematical concepts
Problems, solutions, and definitions
Algorithms
Probability, statistics, and data collection
Calculus: concepts and algorithms
Calculus: mathematical models and algorithms
Mathematics as an introduction to physics
Algorithms for math problems
Mathematics as an introduction to statistics

As you can see, this is a fairly comprehensive introduction to all of these aspects of mathematics. Of course, in a real-world application these concepts could be presented using one of many different forms. In particular, mathematical representations could include graphical representations of formulas that describe the relationships between variables, tables with examples for calculating certain quantities, and images to show how a math problem can be used to solve another problem. This would allow students to see that they are not really solving a problem but rather applying mathematical concepts in a practical way. As a bonus, students could also learn about computational problems such as computing power, computing efficiency, and computational speed.

One problem with this model for learning math is that it is very much a lecture model. Even though the chapters are broken down into different sections, the content isn't really being taught in an engaging and interactive manner. Students who want to understand and apply math to real-world problems will have very little exposure to problem-solving. On the other hand, students may need more hands-on opportunities during this learning process so that they can really see the connections between the different mathematical concepts.

In short, it would be a wonderful experience for anyone in ESFP (Earth Science/Forensic/Pathology/Pharmacology), who wants to deepen their knowledge of mathematics, to go to this course. It's an excellent way to understand some of the most important concepts in ESFP math, while also learning how the concepts of these classes are intertwined with the other concepts in ESFP. There are many ways to apply this idea in a real-world environment; from designing a new drug to solving math problems in an engineering design, you could really use the ideas that the book has to teach you!

A:

Mathematics and Forensic Science have very similar approaches to teaching. In fact, if you look at it well, they are really similar. The first reason is that both fields require students to understand how to read and write code. This usually involves an understanding of how to read a piece of code, and that the structure of the code can be understood through a few simple examples.
So, the only difference between them is that Mathematics can teach students how to write code, while Forensic Science will teach them to read code and to understand and analyze it.
So, students will learn a lot more in Math than in Forensic Science. For example, students learning Mathematics can understand and study linear equations, and can also study the solutions of linear equations. While Forensic Science would teach them how to solve linear equations, they won't get the chance to do that until later in the course, when students go on to study Linear Algebra and Linear Systems.
For these students, the focus will be on linear equations with solutions. For example, Linear equations (a) and (b) are similar to Linear Systems, and their solutions are analogous to solutions of Linear Algebra. So, students who are going to study Linear Algebra and Linear Systems will have more exposure to their classes than will students who are going to study Math alone.

A:

I guess you want me to share my experience in introducing students to the Maths of Science. I had several occasions of explaining linear equations in both cases, and found that both students and instructors usually found it very easy to follow my explanations.
My main idea was to explain the equations through a game, and then show them an example solution, and ask them to explain the solutions for themselves. Then I would explain the solutions in some detail. This way students get the basic idea, and can then apply this in practice.
For example, I explain (a) and (b) with the solution to the following:

So, for example

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the relationships between mathematics and science, we first need to define several terms related to them, so let's start by defining which terms are used in science as well as in mathematics and where those terms come from. It turns out that science and mathematics both deal with very many different concepts, and most of the differences between these concepts is due to the different way in which they are defined.

First, let us define what we mean by'mathematics'. Generally speaking, a mathematical concept is any term used for something (or for many things) in our everyday life that we can use to do calculations. For example, a mathematical concept might be called'multiplier' for a calculator and the term 'factorial' for a piece of paper. Mathematicians do not define what it is that they are trying to measure - they use the terms that they come up with as the means for measuring it. As we will see, we will find many mathematical concepts that are related to physical properties, such as mass and energy - so it makes sense that we would use mathematization to talk about the physical properties of objects!

Next, let's see what we mean by'science'. The word'science' has many different meanings, and most of them refer to scientific discoveries that we have made (for example, a scientific discovery is one that gives new ideas and new methods for solving puzzles, and it's important to note that it may have a lot of applications in science).

Now let us move on to'mathematics.' Mathematics is any term that relates to the concepts of a mathematical concept. For example, if we wanted to talk about how to calculate the mass of an object, we would use'mathematization' because the term'mathematization' comes from the mathematical concept'mass'.

So in summary, mathematics is the language that allows us to talk about what is physically occurring in the world and how it differs from the way it exists in the real world. Science is the language that allows us to talk about the objects that we find in the real world and how they differ from our everyday life.


Now let's look at a few other related terms that may be confusing, but we will use them later on in this chapter and in the rest of this book: 'algebra' and 'algebraic proofs', 'convolution' and 'fourier series','representations of functions' and'representations of function spaces', 'probability' and 'probabilistic analysis', 'function spaces' and'mathematical functions', and 'functions in the reals' and 'functions defined over the reals'.

The word 'algebra' comes from the Greek word 'alègos', which means 'to organize'. The basic idea of algebra is to group together elements that are related - so if we are trying to measure how much mass a particle has, let's use a'vector' (or other 'element of a vector') to store the information, which will be represented by the magnitude of the vector. If we want to calculate the mass of a particle, then we add the magnitudes of all of the vectors that store its position and velocity together, and then use an algorithm to calculate the mass of the particle from this sum. The mathematical term 'algebra' is then a way to group together such information.
In physics, we find 'algebra' for a lot of different reasons. The basic reason is to make certain sorts of calculations easier. For example, imagine we are trying to calculate the mass of a particle by measuring how much weight it carries. Let's say we have a measurement device that has two weights, one of which weighs 10 lb and the other weighs 20 lb. We could use a'vector' to store the information, which would store the information as the magnitude of the vector, and then use a mathematical function to calculate how much the particle weighs. To calculate how much the particle weighs, we would first add the magnitude of the weight stored in the'vector' and multiply that value by the mass of the particle. We could also use a'vector' to store the information about the velocity and then use an algorithm to calculate the momentum of the

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematics works, let's look at a simple example where we define a set of mathematical objects and then manipulate them to create an equation that expresses them in mathematical form. Suppose we have four numbers, N₁, N₂, N₃, N₄, and we are trying to find a formula that relates them. Let's look at some of the basic definitions of these numbers:

N₁ is the number of positive numbers,
N₂ is the number of positive and negative numbers,
N₃ is the number of the two different types of number, integer and fraction,
and N₄ is the number of the three different types of number, integer, decimal, and fractional...
Suppose we have two variables, x₁ and x₂, that are supposed to represent N₁ and N₂ respectively. We then define the variable y₁ and y₂ to represent N₃ and N₄ respectively, and we let y₃ and y₄ represent the variables y₁ and y₂ respectively. Now let us take the variables y₃ and y₄ and define a new variable z₁ to represent the third variable - i.e., N₃. Let's take y₁ and let x₁ and x₂ represent y₃ and y₄ respectively, and z₁ to represent x₁ and x₂ respectively. Finally, let y₃ and y₄ be replaced with N₁ and z₁ be replaced with y₁, and N₂ and z₁ are replaced with y₂, etc. This is how we created our equations:
$$ N = x + x + x + x + z $$
or equivalently,
$$ (x + x + x + x)^2 + (x + x + x + x + x) + (x + x + x + x + z) = 0 $$
Let us now take N₁ and N₂ as two variables and let N₃ and N₄ be two variables. If we want to define a fourth variable, then we'll replace it with N₃. Let's define N₃ as the sum of the N₂ and N₃ variables. Let's let y₁ and x₁ represent N₂ and N₃ respectively, and let's let y₂ and x₂ represent N₃ and N₄ respectively. Let y₃ and y₄ represent N₂ and z₁ represent x₁, and N₄ and z₁ represent x₂... Now all we have to do is let z₁ represent x₁, and all other variables be replaced with x₁ as before. In short, by putting these variables into the equation, we can write our equation in the form,
$$ z = N - x - x + x$$
So to get from N₁ to N₂, we need to have x, y₁, and y₂ (the variables for N₁ and N₂) represented by our variables, the variable y₃ represents z₁, and the variable y₄ represents x₁. Let's see what happens to the sum of the N₂ and N₃ variables (z) when we substitute these variables into the equation.
$$ z = N - z + z - z - z$$
or equivalently,
$$ (N - z + z - z - z)^2 - (N - z + z - z - z) - (N - z + z - z - z) + (N - z + z - z - z - z) = 0 $$
Now let us put the variables into the equation
$$ z = N - x + x + x + x$$
or equivalently,
$$ (N - x + x + x + x)^2 - (N - x + x + x + x) + (N - x + x + x + x + x) = 0 $$
The reason we do this is because the sum of the N₂ and N₃ variables is negative. In other words, it is negative if we delete the variables for N₂ and N₃, but positive if we let those variables stay in the equation. So if we define N₂ and N₃ variables as variables for N₁ and N₂ respectively, then these variables should be deleted from the equation.
$$ N - x + x - x + x + x = 0$$
or equivalently,
$$

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the way we can communicate, we divide humans into four "topologies" (a.k.a. dimensions) - masculine, feminine, ascendent, and materialistic. The four topologies are described here as it might be easier to visualize.
In masculine (also known as masculine topologies) we are very sociable and fun. We tend to have a good sense of humor and generally like to socialize with people of all backgrounds. We are also very outgoing, energetic, and enjoyable. On the other hand, as a person who is often very laid back and easily amused, you may be a lot more reserved, less sociable, and less energetic. On the matter of socializing, you might have a very limited sense of humor and prefer to be with close friends.
On the matter of being laid back, you may have very limited social life. You tend to prefer activities that allow you to take a break from the world - like hobbies or just staying with friends. In fact, you may prefer having your friends around. This may mean you can enjoy having a small group of friends instead of having to deal with multiple people. You may also prefer activities where you can be alone and socialize with people of your choice. It may also mean that you like to socialize with people who make your mind go numb.
The biggest challenge with masculine topology is that it doesn't allow you to feel lonely; you like having people around. The biggest challenge for feminine topologies is that it is usually very easy to fall in love. You just like being around people. However, if you get swept up in a romantic relationship, you may be easily hurt if things don't go as planned. This may be your biggest challenge.
Ascendant (also known as ascendent topologies) are people that have a more scientific approach to life. They take things seriously and can be very detailed in their thought processes. As a person who has an analytical approach to life, you may be inclined to work hard to make sure you can always do things right. On the matter of having a strong sense of discipline, you may have an extreme drive to get the most out of yourself and your work. On the matter of socializing, you may have a good sense of humor.
Materialistic (also known as materialistic topologies) are people who love spending time in the world of work and have a strong drive to succeed. If you are a materialistic person, your drive to succeed may make you lose interest in things outside of work. As a result, you may be extremely focused on the things you do professionally and neglect other aspects of life. You may be inclined to work hard to get ahead in life and make sure you always have the latest tech gadgets, cars, etc. In order to succeed, you may also have strong feelings of ambition and an obsession with achieving goals. This may make you forget about your loved ones in order to get ahead in life.
As a person who loves living in society, you might be very concerned about your job, your career, and all the responsibilities you must take on. This may give you a sense of loneliness that can lead to emotional problems. However, if you are a workaholic, you may have the drive to be with people as much as possible; you may enjoy being with your friends in the company of colleagues who are in the same profession as you. As a result, you might be extremely social and have a very large group of friends to hang out with. However, on the matter of your finances and living expenses, you may be very materialistic. This may make you be very concerned about how much money you have and can afford to spend on life and on your daily expenses.
In summary, each of our topologies is best described as being the opposite of the other. If you look at a person's personality, you will see that each of these four topologies is best described as being one of the four opposite sides of a coin. For example, masculine people have the opposite characteristics of feminine people - masculine people are fun and sociable, but feminine people tend to be the opposite. This is in stark contrast to ascendant people, who

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the world of higher dimensionality, we need to go into great detail! In this chapter I will first introduce the basic concepts of the language we use to talk about higher dimensional objects and concepts - Hip Hop. We will then go on to explain how Hip Hop NLP uses them to understand and describe the world! Let's just keep in mind that we will be discussing Hip Hop NLP, not Hip Hop - unless there's a major difference between them...


Hip Hop

Hip hop is a form of rap and hip hop (also known as Rap, Rhythm and Soul, or Rap-Show) is the form of rap which is popular in the United States and much of the diaspora. Hip hop is a hybrid of music, rhythmic elements, and social issues. Hip hop is used to communicate and promote messages such as social justice, political activism, and diversity. Hip hop is also a social, social justice oriented culture. It is defined by its rhythms, beats, lyrics, and vocabulary, and by the importance of social justice and social change.

Hip Hop NLP

The term "higher dimensionality" is not a simple translation of "space" - it's very much a word that describes the world we experience as a living system. Higher dimensionality is the concept that our bodies are made of energy, and we can only experience a finite number of dimensions of space at any given moment. This gives us the ability to access and use higher dimensions of space to travel between dimensions, as we explore these different realms of space-time...

There are many higher dimensional spaces in which we live. For example, if we look at the Earth from space, we see it look very much the same everywhere (or at least in its 3D and 2D projections). This means that the Earth is an infinitely diverse place. On the other hand, if we look at the Earth from a more high-dimensional space, we get a different view of the earth at any given moment. Let's take a closer look at how space-time and higher dimensionality works and see what it means for our everyday experience...

In the real world we live in, we see that the Earth is an infinitely diverse place. But let's look at an infinite series of infinite dimensional spaces, and see how they compare...

The real earth is made of the same material in every dimension, even though it can have different properties under different circumstances. Each Earth dimension has its own unique properties. For example, in the 3D world, the Earth is made of very dense, dense, dense, heavy material. This makes it easier for the Earth to spin around the Sun, and for us to spin around the Earth! The earth has several layers that we can see as we look through telescopes! In the other dimensions of space we don't see the Earth being this dense, heavy, and sticky - the earth is less dense and lighter! In other words, higher dimensionality and the ability to access different physical properties allow us to access and use higher dimensions of space to travel between dimensions (space-time).

The Earth in a 2D space has the same properties under different circumstances - it is dense, heavy and sticky! This is why it can spin around the Sun in just about any direction! We can access other dimensions of space without changing its properties! As we explore these higher dimensional dimensions of space, we find out about the properties of different dimensions and their effects on the world around us.

The Earth in a 3D space has more and different properties under different circumstances. For example, in the 3D space of our Earth, our oceans are in different physical states due to different temperatures! The oceans in a higher dimensional space have different temperatures! In other words, there are different properties in different dimensions of space. As we explore these higher dimensional dimensions of space, we find out about these differences!

The Earth in a 4D space has different properties under different circumstances. The Earth's surface is extremely different when we look at it from different angles! In this dimension, the Earth contains many dark places where we can't see the surface! For example, dark places such as the deep ocean that we don't even know exists! When we look at a 4D object from different angles, we find out that it contains much deeper and dark places that we

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the nature of things doesn't make any sense in any other way than this three dimensional version of it. Yet we cannot avoid thinking about the fact that space-time is not just an illusion, but also a fundamental concept of reality!

Now let's look at what our three dimensional universe looks like. The first thing to note about this space-time is that it is extremely simple. The length and the time have all been measured using the concept of "length" and "time" as measured on the plane! So, if you wanted to describe how long a string is, how long would you have to go? This is just the plane itself...it doesn't need to be a 3-dimensional world in order for you to make this claim!

In fact, this same plane also divides our universe into two parts. What happens when you cross this plane? Well let's say you cross the plane from the left side of the plane to the right side of the plane - this would cause you to experience a sudden change in direction as we cross this plane. This is called "homotopy type", and it allows us to describe how different types of space-time can be mapped into one another! The first example we see of this is the 4D plane...here it is represented by a 3+1 dimensional version of the original 4D plane! In other words, the space-time in the left column of Figure 1 could be described by our 3D model - the space-time on the left column could be described as a 3D space-time, the space-time on the right column could be described by our 4D model - and so forth...

If you are interested in more examples of how this happens, consider the following example...

Now let's see how we can extend this example to describe how different types of space-time could be described as an underlying 4D model:

Notice that we could use this simple plane to describe how different types of space-time might behave when we cross it. As the plane becomes more curved, so does its underlying space-time. Now let's consider the following:

The shape of our 3+1 dimensional space-time is like a triangle! We could say that if we took a slice through the 3D space-time at a given moment, we would see a slice of this triangle!

However, since we only have three dimensions, any three dimensional objects cannot be sliced into an infinite amount of smaller objects! What this example shows us is that if space-time really were a 3D world, we would be able to see all the different kinds of space-time we could imagine - and in addition we could slice space-time into different slices! Since space-time is a four dimensional fabric, it can only be described as a 4D space-time with three dimensions in between! The next example...

So now we have a simple 3+1 dimensional example of how to describe different space-time models and how they behave when crossed by a plane, yet it turns out that this simple 3+1 dimensional space-time model is not enough to describe the entire spectrum of space-time models! In other words, even if we take a plane that splits our 3+1 dimensional universe into two parts, we cannot slice our 3+1 dimensional space-time into two separate 4D spaces.

This isn't the end of the story! The next step in understanding the theory of space-time is to look into higher dimensional models. A very nice way to explore this higher dimensional theory is by taking a slice of it. In other words, take a slice of any 4D space-time (even if it is infinite) and you'll see that all the dimensions in between will also fit right in between, forming a "loop" of "space-time"!

Let's take a slice of our 3+1 dimensional space-time and observe how the different kinds of dimensions fit into each other - this is what we see in Figure 2!

Now let's take a slice of our 4D space-time. This slice represents a "loop" of space-time! In other words, this slice represents what our previous example shows us, but in an infinite "loop" - in this case the infinite volume of space-time on the other side of the slice! Of course, this is why we call the infinite plane a "triclinic surface", as it is the place where our previous example "loops"

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the concept of good design, it may help to remember that good design is a subset of good programming - which includes a myriad of techniques that we might be unfamiliar with. Let me provide a quick overview of each of these concepts below, as well as some background on each of the frameworks.

The primary component of good design is having a clear understanding of what the end user will be using your program for. This is usually something that is fairly straightforward, especially since we tend to follow user stories, which basically outline our users' overall requirements from beginning to end. As such, the user should always be the one who writes their requirements and will be the one who runs the end user test and evaluates the end user feedback. The reason for this is that the end user is the only one who knows what they are doing, and is more likely to be interested in the outcome than a programmer, who is bound by code.

When designing an application or web page, users are usually represented by some sort of data structure. This data structure is usually designed to model a domain entity, and its relation to other entities. For example, let's imagine you have a web server with a database that stores information about your company. What if your web server was able to connect to another web server and retrieve information on users' profiles? In such scenarios, it would be useful to have a data structure that represented all the users and the data that is associated with them (like what is their gender, how old they are, etc.).

Another popular tool for building a good data structure is the User-Agent HTTP header. By using a HTTP user agent header, you can tell different web browsers what your application is using and what types of data are being retrieved. Users will usually set the HTTP user agent header to something like User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/9.0.375.100 Safari/537.36

The above examples are a few of the many ways in which we can use the HTTP user agent header to gather information about users in order to better understand what the end users want. In real world applications, users often set this header in two ways:

By visiting a particular web site that provides an HTTP user agent header
By requesting a particular page from a web site with an HTTP user agent header

Let's assume you have already created a list of users and stored each user's data in an object of an appropriate type, such as a User object. However, you may still be wondering what an HTTP user agent header is. The answer is simple: The HTTP user agent header represents all of the specifics of the browser used by your end users, and stores all of the information gathered during the request.

There are several frameworks available to help developers and organizations easily implement good design into their code. Let's look at a few of the most popular ones that I know of:

Scrum
Pessimism
Kanban

In the next section of this chapter we will explore all of these frameworks in detail, starting with Scrum!

Leadership
As we've seen in the last chapter, leadership plays a very important role in making and breaking successful businesses. Unfortunately, there are many types of leadership - and there are many different methods of leading teams that lead to successful outcomes - and leaders can make mistakes. To help us make sense of the world of leadership, let's start with a very simple example of leadership that everyone would accept as "standard": the way the CEO leads his/her business.

Imagine you are a CEO in a successful software company, and your employees are all doing their best to give you the best software possible. However, you have issues with the company's financial performance - you want to make it better, but you can't get the money right. As an employee, you have very little idea why you're doing things the way you are. And as a CEO, you're probably even more confused! Are you doing things right because your employees don't have the right training or experience? Or is this just the way things are set up in the world at large? Let's say that everyone's the same,

To better depict the complex role that mathematics plays in a deity's life and to show how it can have a profound impact on their lives, I will briefly recap the main cognitive processes that deity intellects utilize.

First of all, I would like to discuss the concepts of "mathematical structure" and "mathematical function." Mathematical structure refers to the rules and conventions that deity intellects use to mathematically represent their daily lives. While mathematicians try to maintain a level of precision and mathematical rigor to their everyday mathematical works, deity intellects use a more relaxed and informal approach. It is this "relaxed and informal approach" that gives deity intellects the ability to operate with little formalization and consistency.

For instance, a mathematician working on equations (like in the above example above) would write down a list of equations that represent the relationship between variables - the relationship between x and y, for example. Deity intellects work in the opposite way - the way mathematicians write down their equations - they simply express their understanding and personal beliefs. When their intellects are working on a mathematical structure like this, they may feel they are working alone - they feel the need to maintain consistency and precision in order to achieve their goals. In contrast, deity intellects simply express their sense of thought freely and without any pretense.

Of course, the mind of deity intellect can easily be changed when its rules and conventions change. Sometimes, even when deities are following a set of rules and conventions, their daily lives will not be the same. For instance, a deity with a high IQ (such as a high-ranking deity or a deity with a very high intellect) may consider that all her "mathematical structure" and "mathematical function" is consistent. In contrast, a low-ranking deity may think that the same "mathematical structure" doesn't mean the same thing, and thus that it's important to try to follow her own rules instead of following the ones set by her high-ranking peers.

Similarly, deity intellects sometimes have to work in groups (like in the above example above). In contrast to working alone, it is in these groups that deity intellects try to find answers to complicated questions and solve various problems. The reason why deity intellects work in groups is that, as deities are higher ranking than other humans, they have more power over their peers (which often consists of other deities). A deity intellect would prefer to work alone than to be constantly trying to work with people who do not care much about her - to the point where she could even be frustrated because of this. This is the reason that high-ranking deities would prefer to work with other high-ranking deities rather than with others who have lower ranking than them.

I also would like to provide a quick review of the main ideas that deity intellects utilize when working on a mathematical structure. For instance, an intelligent deity may formulate an equation that describes the relationship between the variables - say x and y - that represents the equation between a deity's own intelligence and another deity's intelligence. While other deities might think the mathematical structure is valid, an intelligent deity may think differently.

Another example of mathematical structure that deity intellects utilize is a mathematical equation describing the relationship between two variables. For example, a deity may formulate an equation that tells us the relationship between a deity's own intelligence and another deity's intelligence, when both deities are intelligent. Similarly, a deity may formulate a mathematical equation that describes the relationship between a deity's intelligence and the deity's deity's intelligence. In this case, deity intellects may think that two different intelligent deities can't be identical. They will then try to solve this mathematical structure to determine whether both deities are the same or not.

Finally, there are also deity intellects who will formulate mathematical equations that describe the relationship between two variables. For instance, a deity may formulate an equation that describes the relationship between a deity's intelligence and the deities own intelligence. This relationship will help us identify what kind of intelligence deities have, whether it

To better depict the mind-body dualism, let's assume we already have a good idea about how physical objects work. However, what we don't have in our minds is information about how they work inside of our bodies. Instead, we are left with a series of stereotypical images. For example, we all tend to perceive objects as having sharp, cylindrical shapes. And we may even think of a ruler or a piece of glass as having the same form! How does this get us any help for learning what makes physical objects work?
Let's begin with the most basic cognitive function in our lives: seeing.

We all have some notion of what a good-looking thing looks like. One of the most famous characteristics in art is aesthetics, which describes how beautiful or aesthetically pleasing a thing is. Let's take the term "aesthetic" in a slightly different way: it describes a quality or feeling that people derive from something - this is how people are able to enjoy the things they perceive as beautiful. What is a good-looking thing?

Well, most people tend to think of things as having a certain aspect, or quality - things that we tend to perceive as beautiful have particular characteristics. What are these characteristics? Well, for example, a person's favorite color can be considered to be the kind of color we tend to derive most pleasure from - and people with an eye color like blue are more likely to derive pleasure from blue things. Similarly, a person's favorite flavor can be a specific flavor we derive pleasure from. This is what makes people taste food differently! And what is this flavor? Well, it is the flavor that allows people to enjoy a certain fruit or vegetable! What is this fruit or vegetable?

It turns out that this is where science comes in! According to the laws of physics, all objects are made of matter - specifically energy - but when our eyes are in contact with these physical objects, some energy is released into the air and the body - this is called vision. And what is the energy that enables us to perceive objects as having various shapes and characteristics? Well, in order for our eyes to interpret the object as having a particular shape and color, it needs to come from certain energy sources. If we put some water around a bottle, then this water will expand and become more translucent, but if we put a bubble around a bottle, the bubble won't expand because the bubble has to absorb more water as its volume increases. And that is the energy that lets our eyes perceive different shapes and colors!

Let's imagine that you are a scientist trying to understand how certain scientific objects are made. For example, let's try to understand why there is water around a bottle, and why a bubble doesn't have a chance to appear. Let's try to imagine a piece of paper, which has an energy source that lets the paper appear and glow. But what if we try to put a piece of paper around a bottle without adding any water around the bottle! Now suppose we add some water to the bottle, and then put the bottle around a piece of paper! Now the bottle would expand into a tube, as in the picture below! And why did this happen? Well, because water molecules surrounding the bottle have become entangled with water molecules around the paper in such a way that the water molecules around the bottle are able to pass through the paper in order to be able to float. Now this means that the energy from the bottle that enables the paper to appear and glow, has been absorbed by the water molecules around the paper. In other words, water molecules around the bottle have become entangled with the energy in the bottle in a way that the paper can pass through it and glow. What happens to this entanglement once it passes through the paper?

This picture shows a typical picture of entanglement that occurs when you place a piece of paper or a glass around a bottle. This entanglement is what allows water molecules surrounding the bottle to pass through the paper, allowing the water molecules around the bottle to float between the paper and the bottle. The reason why this happens is that the water molecules on the bottle, at the time of the entanglement, are all in a single molecular chain, which is a long, thin, straight, and dense strand of water molecules. When water

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of "intelligence" we will use concepts from cognitive science to describe the way in which different subjects learn and remember. Let us use some of the principles we learned in previous chapters to start thinking about how intelligence might be expressed and measured.

A subject's intelligence is represented by a mathematical concept called "intelligence quotient (IQ)". IQ is defined as the product of two separate variables: mental ability and memory ability. In addition to measuring intelligence using the IQ formula, many cognitive scientists use the Q-figures in order to help identify which subjects learn and remember information best.

Consider the case of a student who is learning from a teacher in math. The teacher gives them a mathematical problem to solve, and the student uses the mathematics to solve the problem. Now suppose the teacher takes the students on a field trip to find some answers to their questions. Now suppose the student is interested in math questions that they haven't heard before! As they go through the field trip, the student might try to find more math problems. At some point they might get the answer they were looking for, but at that point the student might decide he doesn't know enough math to answer the question.
For now we assume that there is no other explanation than the student's lack of experience and the difficulty of the math.

Let's say the student finally finds the answer to his question, and at the end of the field trip he gives his teacher an assessment of his performance in math. Now the teacher will want to know how this student performed when faced with these same questions in a math lecture! In this case we can use the same concepts we learned about mathematical questions from previous chapters to answer this question. Assume that there is no problem in our understanding of concepts from cognitive science, so let's just say that mathematical questions can be answered by remembering the concepts themselves. But what about when the student does not remember a concept? Suppose the student cannot recall the concept, and doesn't know how to retrieve it from memory! How would the student be able to understand math problems?

In this situation we can assume that there are two different types of memory. First there is a type of memory that is called "constructive" memory, in which the subject is able to construct a new concept from the existing knowledge. In general, constructive memory is a good memory for learning, but it's a bad memory for understanding things that require the application of prior knowledge. This is because when we make a new concept, we have to remember the concepts that we have used previously - so we have to make sure that we understand what we know before we try to apply it to new situations. This is just like when we are trying to remember the information in a list before making a new list. So, if we were to ask a student to remember the list of words that we used previously when making the list, we may be able to make a better list for them to remember.

The second type of memory we have to consider is "episodic" memory. This type of memory can only be used to store information that comes from one moment in time. For example, if an entity were to get a lecture in history, they would have to remember a few things about the past to remember what they were going to be taught in history. What if they were to get a lecture in physics? They would have to remember that the law of energy describes the way objects move and how things change in time. This type of memory is just like how a movie is usually stored in a movie drive - the file is a sequence of frames from the movie. So, how is the student supposed to remember the sequence of frames from the lecture when he can't even remember the concept of the frame?

As we continue to learn about cognitive science and math, we will be able to understand some of the other types of memory that are used by subjects to store information.

The last thing we learned in previous chapters is that the subjects' ability to remember is related to their ability to apply their knowledge to new situations. Thus if a person can accurately make math problems and remember the answers, then they are capable of learning math - assuming that math can be learned! But if they can only recall what they had to learn, that would mean that they

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how we use information (as opposed to just seeing something) we can use a mathematical diagram. Intuitively, a mathematical diagram is the idea of a piece of paper laid out as a set of lines and points. And each line represents a different concept that we would be able to use to solve a problem.
We can represent one concept by laying out a straight line, a curved line, and a triangle. In mathematics, curved lines represent functions and objects that have their own properties or properties of different shapes. And the way we represent this is by drawing a curve around a straight line to tell us something about it.  Imagine placing a small ball on the top of a large rectangle, representing the idea of the ball moving upward in relation to a large space and space filling up. This would be represented by a curved line and a circle which represents the ball as a circle of fixed radius! The straight line would represent the space around the ball! For example, imagine a circle that is around a basketball. Since a basketball bounces on top of a rectangular space, the rectangle would have a circle on top of it, representing the rectangle as a circle of fixed radius (think of a spinning wheel). Now if we take this example further and put the basketball at the base of a triangle instead of at the top, then the space around the triangle would be much more circular than it would have been at the top because of the rotation around the base of the triangle. This would be represented by a straight line and a triangle.
However, in many real problems, not all objects have to travel through one particular path. So you might have noticed that in most problems, when you put together a mathematical diagram you will sometimes see a line that goes through the middle of two or more curved lines.
It's an interesting fact that a straight line has a length of zero and a curved line has a length that is equal to the length of the straight line multiplied by the ratio of their lengths. For example, the length of a straight line is zero and the length of a curved line is 1.618 times the length of the straight line. And these are just some of the different ways of representing straight lines and curved lines.

But what exactly does a mathematical diagram represent?
Now let's look at a mathematical diagram where a straight line represents the length of one of the four sides of a triangle - and we might use it to represent a curved line. Let's say the area of the rectangle was 2 times the length of the rectangle multiplied by the ratio of their lengths (3/4 for the rectangle's length). The area would be 2 (2x)/(4/2) = 2.5. And if we use an index like 1 to represent the horizontal side of the rectangle (so the left side is labeled by 1), and another index like 2 to represent the vertical side of the rectangle (so the top and bottom are labeled by 2), then when we use the mathematical diagram, we use the index 1 and use the curved line to represent the length of each side of the triangle. And since this is not all we would want to do in most real problems, we would use a third index in order to represent the intersection of the two sides of the triangle - this would represent the curved line. Let's say we used the index 3 and used the intersection to represent the length of the curved line and the straight line. And when we use the mathematical diagram, we would use the index 1 and use the straight line to represent the length of each side of the triangle and the index 3 and the intersection to represent the curved line and the straight line.

What is an example of a mathematical diagram?
And what's the difference between a mathematical diagram and a real problem?

As mentioned in the previous chapter, we would often see mathematical diagrams to represent real problems - for example, in the problem depicted in Figure 1, you might see a straight line and a circle. And in this problem, the straight line is used to represent the length of a segment of a circle (the straight line goes from the top of the circle to the bottom of it - this is the part of the circle in the diagram that you see and use in the problem) - and the circle is used to represent the area

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way in which mathematics helps us to understand physics, we will present a few examples. The first one is the idea of parallel lines. Here we will be comparing how mathematics can help us understand a concept like speed of light with how the concept of parallel lines helps us understand speed of sound.

Imagine a ship travelling at different speeds through different levels of space. Imagine also that this ship experiences different amounts of acceleration along the track due to gravitational fields. Is it possible for the ship to travel through all of these levels of space, without experiencing any sort of acceleration or force from the other ones? Let's look at some questions that might help us answer this problem...

What is the speed of sound of this ship? Is it a straight line or a curve as described by the equation of parallel lines?

We can visualize these questions as drawing an ellipse on the space-time graph - one that is tangent to the speed of sound line at all times. The first question asks how the ship experiences acceleration along the speed of sound line - since we already know the amount of acceleration along this line, the second question is completely irrelevant and is simply a mathematical exercise.

How can we calculate the speed of sound of this ship given the speed of the ship and its starting point?

Let's say we know the initial position of the ship. The equation of parallel lines tells us how long it takes the ship to go from one point to the next when driven forward by one of three different gravitational fields. How long does it take to go from one point to the next for the ship to travel parallel to the speed of sound line? This is the question we want to answer by comparing the amount of time it takes to go the ship from this point (1 in the formula for the speed of sound) through all of these layers of spacetime to a point at which this ship was in the beginning of the speed of sound line (3 in the formula).

We will use equations for the speed of sound and a calculator to do this calculation. Now let's say the ship is traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour. The problem here is that we don't actually know how long the ship was traveling during this period of time - let alone what it's speed was at any moment! This is why we cannot calculate the speed of sound of the ship by simply adding up the squares of the three components of the acceleration. So, let's look at one way to determine the speed of the ship.

Imagine that the ship was travelling along a horizontal line. This is where we would imagine the ship was in the beginning of its speed of sound line, when it began to experience gravitational fields. It is at this instant that it would experience an accelerating force, since the distance between points at which the ship is travelling along the horizontal line and the beginning of this speed of sound line is just one of many values that can be chosen for this question. If you are traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour, then you would find yourself just at the beginning of this speed of sound line - the horizontal line - and you would be able to calculate the speed of sound of the ship from the equation of parallel lines for this instant:

If you want to be able to calculate the speed of the ship during other times, this is where the equations for time dilation come in. Because the ship's acceleration and time dilation are different for every moment, it doesn't make sense to take the squares of all these components of acceleration and calculate the overall time duration of the ship's acceleration as time dilation - this would only give you a gross idea of how the ship would have to accelerate between the three different times that it was in the speed of sound line - which we don't actually know and can't even calculate!

So what would you recommend if you were going to do this calculation? It would be best if the ship was travelling along a straight line at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. But it might be more convenient to calculate the ship's speed of sound by using time dilation instead.
Hopefully this example helped you understand some of the concepts behind mathematics. Now that we have a better grasp of how the concept of parallel lines can help us understand what it means to travel across and through space, we

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the theory of cognitive function we need some introductory background. There are two main areas of mathematics that do play an important role in cognitive science. The first is set theory, which is concerned with the formalism of mathematics and the mathematical structure of theories. For more information on this topic we refer you to the Wikipedia article on the subject.

As a general rule, any real, set theoretic object can be described as a collection of elements with a number of relations between the elements (and/or the relations between the elements and other objects). For example, a circle or an ellipse can both be formally represented as collections of points, and the points can be represented as sets. The mathematical structure of theories (or "logic theories") are collections of axioms and equations that govern the theory's logical structure; such theories can be seen as sets of axioms and relations. Such theory can be represented mathematically using sets, such as mathematical formulae.
Another area of mathematics that has great importance for cognitive science is the theory of mathematical representation. This is concerned with the mathematical formalism that makes up a theory - such as set theory. While mathematics has two primary areas of interest, such as sets and structures, other theories can make use of both. Thus, mathematics can be described both as an abstract domain (or "mathematical field") and a set of mathematical formulae (or "mathematical system").

For the sake of this discussion, let's focus just on sets. We will not discuss mathematical formulae or other mathematical structures outside of set theory. For a detailed review of mathematical structures we refer you to Wikipedia article on mathematical structure, and for set theory we refer you to the Wikipedia article on sets.

We will now look at some examples of mathematical structures that can be represented as sets of elements.

The first, and most commonly used, mathematical structure is the set of real numbers: $R=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$.

R is the smallest collection of real numbers that can be represented as a set (the cardinality of $R$ is one). The set of real numbers can be used to represent any other collection of numbers, and it is easy to show that $R \neq \{1,2,\ldots\}$.

When people describe numbers using symbols like "zero" or "four", they're simply representing elements of a collection, rather than representing sets. This is a well known mathematical trick, called cardinality reduction. For example, we can think of $0$ as being the element that is represented as $-1$, and $\frac{1}{2}$ as being represented as $2$. Similarly, we can think of $f,1,2,3,\ldots$ as being represented as $f,f,f,\ldots$. When we express something as a collection of numbers, it's often convenient to keep each number (or set of numbers) in its own set.

Let $A = (A_1,A_2,\ldots)$ and $B = (B_1,B_2,\ldots)$ be two sets. Consider the following set: $$(A,B) = \{\varnothing,A,A,\ldots\}$. Then $$A = \{a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots\}=\{\varnothing,a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots\} = B$$

So if $A = (A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots)$ and $B = (B_1,B_2,B_3,\ldots)$ then $\varnothing \in A$ and $\varnothing \in B$. So a set contains just those elements that are represented using its symbols.

A group is a set of elements that can be combined and arranged into a single set in such a way that their elements form a single set. Let's take the set of integers in $R = \mathbb{Z} = \{0,1\}$. If we add another set to that set, it would be the set of integers in $R\cup{∞}$; that's why numbers greater than $1$ are represented with an asterisk (*) or a plus sign (+). Let's consider the following group: $$(R,\ast)= \{\varnothing,R,\ast,R\cup\{∞\},R\cup\{∞\}

To better depict this process, we can think of it like trying to make a picture from scratch - only a few of the features you see in our physical world are actually present in our brain! Here's an example of the brain and mind:

Now let's try to imagine our brain and mind working simultaneously, so that we can better understand its interaction with the physical world. Here's how this process might go:

Now let's consider the brain as a collection of neurons. These neurons have some form of electrical synapses with other neurons. And a neuron is connected to another neuron through its electrical connections. To make this clearer, imagine two neurons in close proximity. The two cells are connected through short, fast electrical impulses that carry information between the two cells. Now let's imagine our brain as a collection of electrical contacts between neurons. To be more specific, imagine the connections between the neurons as being the wires that are used to build up a picture - only a few of the features we see in our physical world are actually present in our brain! Think of the neurons in the picture as the wires and the connections as the wires connecting the neurons, creating the picture!

Now let's imagine how our brain connects neurons to each other and with other parts of the world. Let's imagine that this information is stored in a very large memory. For each connection, neurons would form a unique array of synaptic connections that store this information in a tiny array called a synapse. The synapses store every electrical connection made between any two neurons. Let's say we have a picture of a cat. Now imagine that a cat and a monkey are interacting by trying to catch a ball. As we can see from this picture, each cat has a unique connection - the connection of the cat to the monkey is a unique number. So if we take a random picture of cats, every one of these connections will have a unique number! Now for the monkeys to make a picture, they will have to make connections to all of the cats (all the unique connections) - just as the cats made connections to all of the unique numbers.

Now let's imagine that all of the unique connections we made between cats were stored together and that these connections were made to each other using the synaptic connections formed by our brain. And then, all of these unique connections were sent down the wires - just as the wires connect the cat to the monkey! Now all of these connections would go down the wires and it would take several more days, weeks, or even months for us to form a complete picture of our world!

Of course, the synaptic connections our brain makes between neurons also create new connections within the brain! For example, let's imagine a neuron that is connected to many neurons in our brain. If these neurons are all connected to each other, this neuron would have to create new connections to every other neuron in the brain to create the picture - just as a cat would have to connect to every other cat in the picture to create the full picture!

Of course, this new connection formation is only possible because of the electrical synapses that our neurons form with each other. And we can understand these synaptic connections by imagining a giant force field - each neuron is a tiny part of a giant force field. This giant force field pulls and binds the neurons together, forming these electrical synaptic connections that make up the synapse. And each of these synaptic connections creates a new nerve impulse that connects neurons together, bringing them closer together. And these nerve impulses come in from all of the neurons in the brain - they travel through the giant force field towards the synaptic connections that form the synapse, and they then leave the synaptic connections that connect neurons together in order to travel between neurons and the rest of the brain (the connections we made up earlier in the brain!).

Now imagine that our brain stores a part of a picture in this giant force field that is very similar to our own brain! This picture is then retrieved from the giant force field (and all the connections from the giant force field towards our neurons as well) and the parts of the picture that we store become part of the synaptic connections forming our brain! This process will repeat many more times, as we all continue to grow and develop in various ways

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea of cognitive functions in physics, we'll use an example that is familiar to all physicists: think of an airfoil. A airfoil is a flat piece of cloth with two or more blades, each of which is attached to a stinger. Each blade's location (the position of the point it touches) is a parameter that determines its power, and a combination of blades on a particular airfoil will produce a particular function.
How do we use this analogy to model mathematical functions? Well, by thinking about a particular function F(x,y) as a mathematical model of an airfoil, we can think about mathematical functions as mathematical models of objects in our universe.

In a sense, an airfoil can be seen as a set of mathematical functions that represent the properties of the object's movements. Let's imagine for a moment that the airfoil that we're representing is made of the five fundamental mathematical functions: x, y, x**2, x**3, and x**4.

Each of these functions is a model of an individual airfoil in our universe, so what we are doing is making a very general mathematical model of our universe itself and then using the results of this general model to describe the properties of other individuals - i.e. how an airfoil behaves under different circumstances. Now, what if we wanted to use this mathematical model to model the function of an airfoil in other areas, like in engineering? Well of course there are engineers who develop mathematical models of airfoils to model the properties of other engineers. In this case we don't make a general mathematical model of the physical world we live in, so what we really do is give engineers a mathematical model of how the physical world behaves...in other words, an engineering model of the airfoil, and we can then use this engineering model to create other engineering models of airfoils, etc...

Let's consider the functions we described above in more detail. We know that each individual airfoil has its own unique set of parameters - in other words, different blades on the airfoil have different speeds, pressures, and areas. To further understand what each parameter means, imagine a simple mathematical model of the airfoil that we'll call T(x,y) in our example. In other words, T(x,y) represents the mathematical model of the blade set on an airfoil (in this example we think of the 5 blades). For the moment we're ignoring the fact that each blade has it's own unique weight, speed, and power, all of which represent the parameters that a particular blade set on a certain airfoil would have.

Now, to model another function, F(x,y), we will need to model this mathematical model of T(x,y). The mathematical model of an airfoil is made up of five parameters that represent 5 of the 12 functions of the airfoil: x, y, x**2, x**3, and x**4; all of which can change depending on the position of the point on the blade of each individual airfoil. So what do we do?

First, we simply add in these 5 different parameters to the mathematical model T(x,y) of an airfoil to represent the 5 different blades on an airfoil. Now, imagine for a moment that the airfoil we're representing is made up of the 5 fundamental mathematical functions as described above: x, y, x**2, x**3, and x***4; all of which can change depending on the position of the point on each blade of each individual airfoil. But now imagine we want to change the parameters of the mathematical model T(x,y) in order to model a mathematical function that might not only describe the power of the 5 blades, but also how the blade set can vary as the position of the point on each blade moves. So now let's change the mathematical model T(x,y) in order to represent the following mathematical function:

This mathematical function describes how the power of the 5 blades varies as the position of the blade set changes - all of which is determined by x, y, x**2, x**3, and x

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the group has had a good time traveling to the various dimensions. Even if they don't realize it right away, they are in the process of being transported to a different dimension. It's important to note, though, that it will take a while for them to realize that these new dimensions are entirely different! In fact, one of the first things that happens when we exit the group (in this case the dimension we were in) is that we begin to feel disorientated - we feel like we've been transported from our normal dimension, like we are leaving our normal reality...but instead we are transported to something completely new and totally different!

I think the only explanation to what these people are feeling is that they have some kind of "sense of adventure" in them that they are feeling now. Like I said above, it's probably some of the excitement of being in the new dimension - and remember that this experience is entirely new for all of us (except perhaps the people on this trip), so if anything feels strange to you, that's a good thing!

However, I think we can all agree that these people will have some kind of a good time on this trip. I will admit to being a bit nervous at first, but once we start enjoying the trip, it becomes less of a fearful feeling...if anything, it's more of a reliving the past that is now taking place. It's also the fun of getting new friends (and maybe also of getting to know and meet old friends!)  It's also the fun of meeting new people in different dimensions!

If you have any questions about this trip or about anything in general, feel free to ask on this page!

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the human mind is the biggest mystery we can face! To put it bluntly, we are all made up of brains; but why? Why do we need to think? Where did it come from, and how is it connected to us today?

It turns out that the answer to this question lies in our cognitive functions (or mind-body systems). We are all made up of various systems, and every one of these systems has a different function; just like any other piece of equipment, it can be used for different things depending on the purpose.

Before we get into this topic in more detail, let's remember that all of our cognitive functions originate within our brains. We all have one - the same, "inner core" - that is where all of our thinking resides. This inner core is the "core" of our mind, so that when something is wrong with this core, our thinking is also corrupted. And that's why we can't communicate with other people!

As mentioned above, our brain contains a large collection of neurons - each of these neurons is an individual piece of data that has it's own memory and ability to make decisions! These individual pieces of information travel through each of our various sensory channels - our senses are what help us make sense of everything around us. Each of our senses are connected to this core in some way or another - all the same way that a computer contains a large collection of RAM to store various pieces of information!

So if you want to understand our mind, you need to understand our brains! As we've covered in previous chapters, our brain is the biggest mystery that exists - and it's very difficult to fully grasp! We don't just have one brain; we also have many! Each of these brains has a specific function, and as we continue to explore their structure, we will begin to learn more about their mysterious and intriguing nature! However, if you want to learn more about their inner workings, you can use all of the tools at your disposal!

Let's take a look at some typical MBTI models. Each one of these models was designed to help people (and companies) gain more insight into their potential and personality traits!

The Basic Mind Map (the "BM"), also known as the MBTI, was first created by John Gottman in the late 80s. This comprehensive model, which has been updated several times since, consists of 11 dimensions and 2 sub-dimensions. It is divided into five levels according to our personality type (or personality type) - A, B, C, D, and E. The basic MBTI was inspired by the work of Carl Gustav Jung, whose theory of personality is still in use today!

As a guide, let's consider each of these five levels and their corresponding characteristics:

Level A - Kind, patient, empathetic
Level B - Optimist, analytical
Level C - Dramatic, ambitious
Level D - Creativity, explorative, curious
Level E - Dramatic, stubborn, hardworking

The level A personality is characterized by kindness, patience, empathy and open-mindedness. People who fall into Level A are easily able to relate to people of all backgrounds - this is why they tend to be social butterflies and are generally friendly with everyone.

Level B personality is characterized by optimism, analytical thinking, and strong will-power. The tendency to make decisions and take risks is strongly expressed in Level B. As we move up on the MBTI, the level tends to become more optimistic, curious, and creative. The B level people are also more focused on their goals, while the E level is characterised by creativity, ambition, and hard work.

Level C personality is characterized by drama, ambition and strong determination. People who have the C level tend to have the drive and drive to work hard. They may have a great sense of humor, but also a strong sense of independence and need to be their own boss. The C level personality tends to have a positive outlook on life and are optimistic, confident, and confident. They tend to be a bit of a perfectionist!

Level D personality is characterized by the creativity of the D level. People who have the D personality have a strong sense

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict what happens on Baker Street on New Year's Day, we'll use the image below as a starting point:

Now let's consider the situation where the two of us meet in person for the first time and decide to marry each other. How would this affect our lives?

We could start from the point of view of the other person - the other person is going to be watching us from afar! If we would only marry in secret, no one would ever know we were together. The person in question would not even realize there is an actual wedding going on!

To better understand this situation, let's imagine that our own life is currently under some sort of government surveillance! Our lives would be completely turned upside down - our friends, family, and even neighbors wouldn't be aware of our lives! Our children would not even know we're married! 

We would be forced to change our name, our job, and even our political affiliation and we would have to renounce everything we hold dear. And since we're married, no one would really care about us as we would be completely isolated, no one would even know of our existence at all, and we wouldn't even be able to go out for anything at all!

Now that we understand what would happen, let's imagine what would happen to the other person - the other person would notice that we are not married but would still be able to see through the walls that separate us! No one would even notice that we're together if our separation is only the result of a government watch over us!

To better understand this phenomenon, let's assume that we are in the middle of a fight and don't know how to stop it! Let's say we're trying to use a knife to cut someone in half to get rid of them! However, before we could do anything about it, we would have to cut a hole in the middle of our body to let them through! In other words, if we were to break up a fight, we would have to first kill one of the involved party to remove their heads - not to mention cutting open their bodies to take the blood out!

Now that we understand this phenomenon, let's imagine that we are just sitting around drinking tea with our friends - we're all having a good time, enjoying each other's company! And let's say that suddenly someone walks up to us, picks up our tea bags, and makes us eat them! All hell breaks loose and we explode! The person in question immediately starts throwing away our tea bags because they weren't meant for us...yet! At this point, we may not even realize that we have left the room for all of a sudden!

Now that we understand what would happen to each of us as we were just doing what we were originally going to do, let's imagine what would happen to the other person in our scenario as well! The person in question would immediately run to take her tea bags - they'd think that we were going to throw away them, but that was the end of the story! This was exactly what the person in question would end up doing as we all consumed our tea bags and had no idea there was an actual wedding going on.

The first time we met, I thought we were going to have a good time until the end. Then, the moment our wedding day finally happened, we both realized that we're not only married, but actually have kids! We couldn't keep secret from each other anymore - we were being watched! And of course, our friends didn't even know we had kids! The kids would not even know that we were together! 

Of course, we can only assume that things went like that for some reason...it is possible that we are hiding our true identities, but for the most part, it is unlikely that we are really married. This is why we would prefer to stay single, or at least, to hide our true identity in an organization that will only keep us in our privacy!

Well that was all about dimensions, marriage, and how they affect our everyday lives. You know that there is a lot going on right now! We will definitely keep you updated on the rest of this chapter as we continue to explore this fascinating topic.

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict a ceremony we will choose to discuss the Mexican American religion called Manioc and its importance in the local and national culture. In particular, this religion is practiced by people who are called Maniac, or Mayan, in Mexico. This is a religion that is centered around the idea of time and death.
In the past, the Maniacos practiced a rituals called El Cura (El Cura literally means the Curator). In this religion, a priest (or priestess) would go to a place called El Cura, usually called La Gruta del Cura (The Cave of the Curator), and pray to a supreme being, called El Cura, to help them with their spiritual journey. The priest would then perform an oral ceremony to call El Cura and express how important he is to the Maniaco. This would be similar to what we will describe below.
The priests would then prepare a meal that would be shared with their guests. During the meal, the priest would introduce the guests to the sacred objects and tools, which were used during the ritual. Some people believe that by eating at the cave, the guests would be able to gain an understanding of their spiritual path.
However, because the Maniacos are not considered to be very sophisticated, the rituals are generally not followed strictly. And in fact, most Maniaco have nothing but curiosity as to the purpose of the rituals - just to make money out of their guest's curiosity.
To keep up with the day-to-day life of the Maniaco, the priest would prepare a number of rituals that they would perform during the day and evening hours. The nighttime rituals are usually much more complicated and may include prayers to ancestors, sacrifices to the gods, and many other events. The priests also would drink a blood sacrifice called Quetzalcoatl, which is a mix of goat blood and human blood. This is then put into a special jar and given to a special living being called the Qhuil, also called a Quetzalcóatl.
During the ritual, the priest would place a small box in front of the person the priest wishes to bless, and fill it with the blood sacrifice (Quetzalcoatl) and the prayers he would be asking him/herself. When the priest opens the box, a huge red glow would appear from the box which would take up a large portion of the room. During this glow, the priest would have a vision, which would be very similar to what you would experience when you see the sun rise. The priest would then tell the person's name and how the priest desires him/her to respond to the message he sent to him or her. The person would then open the box, and when it is opened, the entire vision that the priest saw would then be projected onto the box, with the priest using his body to tell what the vision said. The person would have an opportunity to respond to the priest by asking the person many questions, either on his or her life or some question that he would be having about the vision that he or she has seen. The priest would then take a picture from the box, and when he or she opens that photo, the vision would appear in that photo, with the priest using his body to tell what the vision said. With each question that the person asks, the vision would take a picture from the box, and then the priest would take another picture of the box, and so on. There would be many questions, and most of the time, the person would be asked very vague questions. The priest would then tell the person what they were to do with their answers in order to gain access to the other world.
Once the priest has obtained the answers from his or her guests, the priest would place the box in front of the person. The box would then be placed on the altar, and the priest would then pray to the Qhuil. The priest would also ask the person to eat his or her food, and also pray to their ancestors. The person would then be given his or her food and be asked to give the priest his or her blessings. The priest would then give the person his or her blessings

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict what happens when you take advantage of your powers and then run out of them, let's say you have an army of 12 robots that can move through three dimensions, one of which is stuck in Dimension Z. It will be up to you to make the army of robots return to the world of life as it exists today, possibly in another dimension of your choosing.

In our everyday life, we use the term "return" to refer to something that takes place after having used up all of its energy - something like a robot returning to the ground after having walked away from a distant planet. However, this metaphor is far too simplistic! Imagine someone running away from something, but only moving a few feet each time. The creature must constantly push itself back out of the way of the object that holds it. Eventually this will lead to it catching up with the object, and after a certain distance it will be too far away to reach it. This kind of return is only possible through use of magical power - our powers make it possible to take advantage of this power and travel back at will!

Let's say we want to run away from Dimension Z by just jumping off a building! Now imagine that there are 12 robots standing atop this building and a few steps away from where it is supposed to be. Let's say one of these robots is stuck in Dimension Z, but they have already run away from it on Dimension X! Now it would be up to this robot to make sure that all 12 of its members (12 * 3) get all of their energy back! How much energy does it take to make this happen? Well, let's say there are 12 units of energy - we call each one a kilowatt! So the energy that it takes to reach Dimension X is 12 * 1000! If all 12 of these robots make this move in their own individual order - the result of this motion would be a total speed of 13,000 kilometers per hour! Of course, this is impossible! How do we explain this strange phenomenon?

What makes Dimension Z's space so incredibly fast for robots to move through? Well, when you think of how the speed of a car increases with the acceleration of its wheels, you might think that this is the driving force behind the rapid motion of the robots on Dimension Z! But no! This is simply because Dimension Z has a greater amount of energy per unit area - as you might have figured out, a higher number of kilowatts per square kilometer gives rise to a faster speed of a car!

What makes Dimension X's space incredibly slow for robots to move through? Well, the reason for this slow speed is because the space on Dimension X is extremely small compared to Dimension Z! Since Dimension Z's space is so much greater than Dimension X, the amount of energy needed to move a robot through Dimension Z is equal to 12 * 1000 / 4, or 12.5 kilowatts per square kilometer! As a result, for robots to move through Dimension Z, they must consume 12.5 kilowatts per square kilometer per hour of energy! This means that for the robots to move through Dimension X, they would need 12.5 * 1000 / 13,000 = 8.5 kilowatts per square kilometer - roughly the same amount of energy as the robots are supposed to consume to travel through Dimension X!

In other words, if you want to travel to Dimension Z, you need to expend 8.5 kilowatts per square kilometer! And as we have already seen, that is actually impossible...so what happens?

Well...this is where Micelia comes in! According to a mysterious scientist named Professor Leigh, it is possible to turn off the self-destruction capabilities of robots - by controlling their bodies' power supplies, they can run out of energy without losing their abilities! This is actually the only way to control the speed of a robot, but how does this work?

We all have heard about how there are no limits to imagination. Imagine what happens when you try to create a space-time that has the same amount of space as a person in our everyday life would have! Well, this is something that is indeed possible, because according to the Einsteinian theory of relativity, space-time is three-dimensional and time is

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the idea that there are higher and higher dimensional spaces is pretty crazy! Yet, there are certain people who seem to believe in that as a sort of natural law - that is, it's really hard to see why anyone would be out to get such a preposterous and unbelievable idea.

I remember the classic film 'The Truman Show' in which Robert C. Cooper (played by Andy Warhol) says that in his perception of life as he perceives it on earth, all dimensions exist in a single space - but that our perception of time and space are different. The time dilation theory seems to work out rather nicely when we consider that time is our main dimension, and so our perception of time is simply how much time we have to experience something. On the other hand, our perception of space is our main dimension - that's the length of the line from the current point of view to its corresponding point in another point of view (in time). Our experience of space is thus how long it takes us to cross that line from one point to another point...and time dilation seems to work out rather well!

In light of this, how do we know if our world really is composed of various different dimensions? Well according to C. S. Lewis, there are plenty of stories in the Bible where there are people who believe that other dimensions exist. For example, the following biblical passage is from the book of Genesis - a well-known story of creation. Here is the literal translation:

God blessed the earth and formed it, and He gave it order:  "Now therefore let the angels gather the stars and the planets in a place called the heavens; for there they shall dwell for ever; they shall know the year and the day by the star, and it shall be very fine days. And God blessed them and said, 'Let there be fruit in the earth for to feed the birds of the heaven, and for a food for the cattle that are upon the earth...I will put a seed in the ground, and it shall give a fruit for life unto the family of the earth; they shall eat it up and live for ever.'

But to be fair, there's something about this verse that really just really doesn't make much sense to me - how could God put seed into the ground? Are these angels supposed to be trying to find some kind of egg or something - or did the creation of the universe just seem to happen in a flash? Perhaps the author of the Genesis story didn't think enough carefully about where to start his story...or could he be simply writing it down like a writer in a novel! Or maybe the story is simply a simple one-man show where some idiot has just created the whole story of creation without thinking much about its meaning. In any case, it's incredibly sad to see that people like Warhol are just sitting around thinking about such a simple and unimportant idea, when we all know that there's really nothing important to think about when we come to the creation of the universe.

As with most creative, mind-melting ideas, it doesn't take long to convince people that there's a better, and more beautiful universe somewhere...only it took Warhol so long to be able to convince anyone that there's actually something there! But to the people who are simply reading this at their leisure, it's still pretty cool to see that a bunch of ignorant, mindless people have convinced everyone else to believe that there really is a better universe, and not just some idea they got through the internet...or maybe the internet...or maybe even just a bunch of YouTube videos!

If you are looking for further information on this subject, you may want to read up on Pyramus and Thisbe, whose story is one of the most well-known in the world of literature. This book is basically the story of two brothers, brothers who think that the sun comes from the west and that the moon comes from the east! In this book, the Pyramus and Thisbe story is told in a variety of different ways, sometimes using different characters and other times using the same characters. Of course, these books do tend to have some sort of magical element...and some sort of philosophical element too! But they do, in

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the only reason I am a scientist in the first place is because there are so many great things I like to do! And science is one of those things that just happens to be my passion. But not all scientists are as passionate about science as me. Some people, like me, have a very narrow view of what science is about and therefore make little effort to learn it. And if I don't learn it, then the person who does know it will have little hope of ever becoming one either...

Now that I have more experience and knowledge of what science is, how important is it to be a good scientist? Is it just so important that when you graduate you will be a world class scientist? It is important for scientists to know how to talk to students about their ideas, and for students to know that they are being listened to and understood, which means that they should learn how to learn. And it is important for students to understand that scientists do not teach the answers or how to solve their problems, they provide the tools and the tools make the task of learning much easier.

But as I said earlier, scientists also work hard. Scientists have to constantly improve their abilities in order to make it more useful and more useful the more they use these tools. And sometimes, scientists need help. It is hard to keep up with the latest research that you could be studying - you probably won't have access to all of this stuff in the academic program that you are enrolled in. So if you need a quick overview of what you're reading, do yourself a favor and go into a library. Or even better, ask your professor for some guidance in class on what you should be doing! He or she is probably already doing this and should know enough about the subject that he or she will probably guide you in the right direction. It is also important to make sure that you check the literature that comes with your research papers and make sure that you are following all of the rules.

Now let's look at some of the other problems that many scientists experience. I know some people don't like to sit around in their offices and do the usual boring research paper writing stuff - this can also be a problem for scientists. If you're a scientist with a paper that you've been working on for a while and have enough information to back up your research, you can always use that information when writing your own paper. However, if your research is in some way outdated or even completely off of the real world, there is no way you can ever be sure that your paper will actually get published.

Another problem often reported by scientists is that they are just not getting enough work from students. This can be frustrating. If you aren't getting enough work to keep up with, it is not uncommon for you to be left to finish your last paper when you have a couple of students coming in on your work. So it is important to be sure that your projects are working and that you are making the most of your students...or better yet, make sure that you are making your students proud!

In some schools, a new doctoral student must take one of the following courseworks:

Cognitive Science - a short course in cognitive science and its relevance to our field
Cognitive Neuroscience - a course in the basic principles and applications of cognitive neuroscience

Basically, this is what a cognitive science student does: they study the brain, brain processes, neural pathways, how they interact, etc... and try to learn more about the ways in which we think. They use this information to try and make themselves more knowledgeable about what happens in the brain and what makes us think. Of course, cognitive science is not the only area that involves using basic cognitive science principles in solving scientific problems. There are other areas that involve using these principles to find solutions to scientific problems, such as the study of the neural pathways of the brain.

So as we have seen, some scientists think that science should help solve problems that are both important and easy to solve, but they also understand that science should not get in the way of solving problems that are more difficult to solve. But it is important for scientists to understand that sometimes they need help to solve difficult problems, and they should get as much help

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict this idea, we will be using an example from our fiction world, the Book of Kings. In that book, kings are depicted as having a number of attributes and behaviors (although I won't be discussing them any further in this chapter).

This is what a kings body looks like:

In the world of our story, Kings are represented in a number of different ways, such as the Book of Kings, the Lord of the Rings, and even our own popular culture. In the Book of Kings, the title "king" means quite a bit to our hero, Sauron. In that book, Sauron is king of a whole new realm, called the Shadow Isle. At one point, Sauron is said to have had an accident when he took over this new world - the world of his ancestors who lived in time travel. So when his friends came to claim him, he was no longer in time travel, but in a real world somewhere.

In this world of Sauron, he is depicted as having a number of different attributes (though the exact number varies depending on the book). One of the characteristics most commonly used in the fictional world of the Book of Kings is that of being a king. One of the reasons why it is possible for a king to have an unlimited number of attributes is because the book was written from the point of view of our protagonist, Sauron. That is, the book was written to show us exactly how our hero is. In this way, the book tells us that, in spite of what many people think, it is very possible that Sauron is in fact not king in the Shadow Isle.

In the Shadow Isle, our hero's body is depicted as consisting of only one attribute: a king attribute. In that realm, it is easy for the world to understand that he has unlimited power as he can do anything he wants to do. For example, he could rule the entire shadow Isle (because, as he is known to be in that realm, he is known to control the shadows), he could be the head of the Kingdom of the Shadow Isle (because he controls the sun) and even he could be the ruler of other worlds (since it is possible to be at the helm of other worlds)! In reality, Sauron could do all of those things, because he is in the real world.
Let's take a closer look at this mysterious power of our hero's...or rather, how his body would appear in this world.

For one, we will be going back to the source of his power, the Book of Kings. In that book, Sauron, who is also the creator of the Shadow Isle, is said to have a sword in his hand. This sword has four fangs and can pierce through every conceivable surface. In many places, Sauron uses this sword in battle, but if he had just one fangs on his sword, he could do the same thing!

In the Shadow Isle, Sauron's body is depicted as being in a state of flux. The only thing that is held constant is his king attribute. This is because, as he has unlimited power, he can "transform himself" (he uses this phrase over and over again in the book) into any desired form, including himself! So when he is not using the sword, he might look very different to us in the reality of the Shadow Isle. However, in the real world, his body only becomes the type of body he is in the Shadow Isle! In reality, Sauron is in his own body, and that means his body is the only thing that is held constant in this realm.

Since it is not really possible to change the shape of Sauron's body, how would this affect his attributes? Because when Sauron is not in the body of the real world, his body simply transforms itself into a different form, as he does in the Shadow Isle. When it comes to the attributes of his body, he would simply have two attributes in this world - two attributes of his body in the real world. In the shadow Isle, Sauron's body is the only thing that is "constant" - his attributes would not change. Because of this,

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict how far back we can go in time, let's do a quick case study.

Imagine you are walking down a dark hallway - a room filled with dimly lit walls. You may even have a dim light to help you see. Now, you stop at a dark door - one that you just cannot see in the dark! This door is one of the many doors in the room, but there's one other dark door as well! If you look through the door that you just cannot see through, you will see the door behind you - one where you've been left! It seems like that door is always one step away from you - but there is a way to get past that door!
Let's try and figure out why.

Think of the door as an object. Think of the dark door as a force. Let's also assume that the door does have a certain force field around it that prevents it from opening unless it is acted upon by a force.

It turns out that the door must have a certain kind of energy density in order to prevent itself from opening - if this were not the case, it could easily be pushed open by anyone, so there could be no physical law that prevents it from doing so! Of course, once this kind of object is pushed open, it is no longer capable of resisting any further attempts at pushing it open.
So how does the door work? Well, it has some sort of sensor attached to it that senses the force - the door just cannot keep up with the force until it stops sensing it! This is just because there is a certain kind of energy that determines how strong the door can be - a certain amount of energy density! If this energy density is higher than the door's threshold, the door is then capable of resisting further attempts at pushing it open - if it wasn't, it would literally be able to break apart! In other words, it is an energy-driven door that allows you to pass through without being noticed!

Let's examine a few different ways that energy density is used.

Forgetting about your power supply, it's worth noting that the door can resist further attempts at opening because when this happens, all of its sensors will suddenly become dead and disable it for all intents and purposes. If there is no power supply, however, then there is no way to activate these sensors - the energy that made the door operate will simply "quit" as soon as you leave it behind! Of course, this will leave the door unable to detect any further attempts at pushing it open and it will cease to function! You might assume that the door could just shut itself down - but it's not that simple. Rather, there is a certain amount of work that must be done in order to wake up the door and let it continue to function!

Let's take a closer look at the energy density that is used to wake up the door and determine how it works. Let's consider a simple 4D box - if you move it one step, its energy density will drop to zero. And let's assume that the door is made of a kind of energy - let's call it energy Density M. When the door is "up" (with an energy density of zero), then the energy density of the box will be equal to the energy density of the box before the door was pushed open. So if we simply move the box one step, then it's energy density would drop to zero. Now, if we move the box two steps, then its energy density will drop to zero too! So after two more steps, the energy density of the box is equal to the energy density of the box when the door was opened! Now let's assume that the box is able to take on a certain amount of energy density; let's say it is able to take on 10 energy density.

Now let's consider another case! Let's say that the door is pushed open by a force of magnitude F that is equal to 10 energy density - i.e., it takes on 10 times the strength of the door's own force field. If we then start moving the box further and further away, at some point the box becomes so weak that it will begin to suffer the same kind of energy density loss as the door. It's still important to note that when we first start moving the box, it's

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the physics behind magical realism, I'll use an old joke from the 1950s called The Magician's Apprentice. Imagine a magical potion made up of all the objects and materials that the magician needs in order to create some magical effect. Now imagine this potion sitting on a large plate and being transferred from one person to another through a pipe.
Now imagine that, suddenly, the magical potion begins to disappear. And imagine that all the people who tried to make this potion start to complain that they just can't make it anymore. Now imagine a few of the people who have failed to successfully create this magical potion trying to look up their magical materials and discovering that they have no idea where the potion was going! Imagine what happens next - the people in despair start throwing things at the person who made the magic potion (or vice versa)!
Now imagine how a few years down the road, people come to realize that what happened was due to the magic potion's disappearing - it was just a matter of time before it had completely vanished!

However, despite all of these mysteries, the most exciting part of the story is the one that took place inside the magic potion. Imagine the magic potion sitting on the large plate with the magicians who made it, on one side, and the people who tried to create the potion, on the other side. It was soon obvious that the plate had been placed at the very bottom of a large vase! But no matter where this large vase was placed, the magic potion stayed intact for as long as people had remained at it! This is where real magic happens; people simply place their hands inside the magic potion without really realizing what they are doing!

It turns out that the magic potion is actually made up of all the materials and objects required to create the magic effect - just like most people create their own magical effects in order to enjoy them the most. This is where the magical realism and magical realists come into play. In other words, people create magical effects in order to make themselves enjoy them the most - but they also want it to stay as long as possible without the magic effect going away!

So how does the magician, in this case, manage to create this magic potion with the objects and materials he has at hand? Well, the magician is quite clever! He just made an entire potion out of objects and materials he can easily find. This means that when someone is looking for a potion, he doesn't need to be looking through all sorts of different dimensions...just a simple looking for and finding will get him the potion! For instance, imagine a potion that contains a bowl, a cup, a bottle, and a spoon. The bowl will be placed inside the potion because the cup is easy to reach and use; the spoon is useful for opening the cup; the bottle has enough room to store water without needing to be emptied again (and since it contains a large amount of water, the container will take up a lot of space, but it will still be able to hold the liquid inside it without actually getting wet).

Then imagine that someone is looking for a spoon. The spoon will be placed at the bottom of the bowl because the bowl and the cup will be placed at the top. This makes it easy for the spoon to be in the middle of the potion, and it will then be able to sit on top of the spoon without being damaged. So people can get the spoon out and use it without any problem!

Now imagine a couple of people are looking for a cup. They first place their hands inside the potion and place it on the plate at the bottom, then start to search for the cup. However, once they reach the top, they realize that the cup disappeared! This is where the magician takes on the role of the magician; he searches for the cup and then places the cup at the bottom, just like the cup disappeared when he placed the potion on the plate.

Now imagine that two people are looking for a bottle. They first place their hands inside the potion and place it on

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the behavior of objects in 4D spacetime, it would be helpful to introduce two additional concepts to consider: direction and speed. Let's first go through the simple example of a particle traveling at velocity vx along a line, as shown in the following figure:

Imagine that we want to study this particle and how it would behave under various circumstances. If we were to measure the velocity of the particle and use it as the basis for all of our measurement tools, this would mean that our observer would be observing the particle at a constant speed of vx! Obviously this is impossible! We would need a measurement device that could measure the velocity of the particle at any given instant, and as a consequence we would need some type of speed or direction measuring device to convert this velocity into an object's actual distance from us! In other words, the particle would need to be moving "slowly" or "very slowly" to be able to be measured at any instant! Imagine that you and your friend were on the train travelling through a train station! We are the train traveling at some specific speed, and we are standing on the platform looking at the train, waiting for the train to reach us. On the train station, we were already at a certain location at that particular time, so we do have a certain direction towards the station. Once we reach the station, the station clock will be ticking, and when the station clock reaches a certain time, that station will be on its way to the train, and we will be able to determine the distance we are travelling in from this station! The point at which the station clock reaches this time is the location at which the train was expected to arrive!

So, what would the distance of the train at any given time be if we started at this location, and moved at some constant velocity vx towards the station? Well the distance we were travelling in at that instant would be:

So, in the real world, it's not always possible to know what the exact location of the train would be, or what the exact velocity of the train would be if we started at a specific location, and started travelling at constant velocity vx towards a particular destination! In other words, it's not always possible to have a precise "state of space" in a 4D spacetime. But, you can't even know the actual distance you are travelling in! However, it's still possible to get a sense of what the exact location of the train would be by imagining that we start at this position and continue moving at a constant velocity towards that location! In other words, you could "see" the actual location of the train at this moment!

So what does this tell us about the movement of objects in 4D spacetime? Well the answer is pretty simple: they follow the line of sight they are traveling in to whatever location they are at! In other words, if you follow the trajectory shown above, you will eventually reach the station where the train is currently waiting for you, but, the real answer about how much time it would take us to reach the station is that, since we are travelling at constant velocity vx towards that station at any instant, it would take us exactly that amount of time to arrive at the station...time dilation!

The following is a more detailed diagram of how the motion of a particle could be determined. The particle would be travelling at a constant velocity vx towards a station. Now we would be able to visualize the path taken by the particle as it travels through the 4D space-time, since we know it's constantly travelling at some constant speed. Let's say we measure the length the particle travels through a unit of time. For example, say we measured the length at a given time of 100 seconds. When the station clock reaches 100 seconds, the station will be on its way to the train, and we'll know exactly where the particle is located, since it will be travelling at the exact distance of 100 seconds along the line that we measured at 100 seconds! 

So we know that the particle has taken a certain amount of time to travel from Point A to Point B, and we've now constructed a graph that shows how this particle has traveled through this time. If we compare this graph to the diagram of the

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the universe is 4D (or more generally 5D). In fact, that is what Einstein's theory of relativity suggests. Unfortunately, as we have seen, it is impossible to enter any higher-dimensional universe without passing through a lower-dimensional one first. And that's why we get a weird feeling when we're introduced to a person who's the height of their physical capacity - as if something is wrong with them, or if they don't feel their way around the universe the way we do!

However, the very next time we meet someone with the most extreme personality traits, their most extreme physical attributes, or their most extreme mental capabilities, there's a good chance that the underlying cause of their abilities, limitations, or disabilities is outside of what we understand, or even that they are being tested using tests that don't properly reflect reality - something that our mind can only comprehend very low-level at best!

So let's begin by identifying a few important people who have never experienced a lower-dimensional existence. Let's make it a little more specific, we'll talk about those people who have never experienced the dimensions 2 and 3. We'll leave out those people who have experienced the dimensions 4 and 5 as they aren't related to either the earlier or later categories we've just described...unless you consider them separately as well!

The first person to meet who has never experienced a lower-dimensional existence is John Myers. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, John's body was built entirely of mass - a typical human body would be made up of roughly the same amount of matter as the sun. However, in our normal 3+1 dimensional universe, mass is measured in units of kg, and not kilograms (kgs is used for that purpose in our country), so John's body would only contain roughly half the mass that a typical human body would contain. And according to science fiction, John has the ability to travel through dimensions and gain access to other dimensions, albeit not directly...

What would this mean for him? First of all, according to the laws of physics, mass travels at a very rapid rate and the speed at which objects are travelling is directly proportional to their mass - just like a car traveling at its maximum speed will travel at a much higher rate than an ordinary car traveling at about 50km/h. Additionally, speed of light in the universe is actually constant - that is, the speed of light is the same in all dimensions, so it doesn't matter in which dimension our object is in, it travels at the same speed as in all dimensions.

Thus, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, John is able to travel through lower-dimensional space-time (the length and speed of light would be the same in all dimensions), but unfortunately he is physically limited to it (the laws of physics state that the rate of change of a quantity is directly proportional to the quantity itself). But while John's physical abilities are limited in a lower-dimensional universe, his mental abilities would go way beyond our understanding - he's been shown to possess some sort of psychic ability that would allow him to understand and perceive certain higher-dimensional realities!

But why is John considered the only person ever to be able to travel through lower-dimensional space-time? Because according to our usual understanding of reality, this would mean that every other person who lives in a lower-dimensional world and can sense dimensions would be able to cross over! But to do so, it would require them to first enter a higher-dimensional world and understand and then pass this ability down to the next generation of the lower-dimensional people. To make this even more convoluted, John is also a physical genius that could actually fly across the vast majority of lower-dimensional realities (because he can sense them!). This means that he could travel through almost all of lower-dimensional realities in a very quick and direct manner! At the very least, however, he would eventually have to gain this ability at some point. That would mean that he would have to learn to cross through lower-dimensional spaces, and that would be a long and expensive process in which he would most likely have to fail. As he can only understand things at a lower level than we do, he's likely going to fail this process!

This leads us to our second individual, who we believe would be able to pass
