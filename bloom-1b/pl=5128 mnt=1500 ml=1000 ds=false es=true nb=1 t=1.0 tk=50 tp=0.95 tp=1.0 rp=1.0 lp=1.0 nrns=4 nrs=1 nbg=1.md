 Of course this is only possible if they are in a higher dimensional universe, but that's not the case for most of us!

So, what does all of this mean for us? Well, it means that we can now understand how objects move through different spaces and dimensions without having to rely on Newton's laws and Einstein's theory. This is a huge step forward in understanding how objects behave in different situations, and it also means that we are now able to predict how objects will behave in different scenarios - which is a huge advantage in the real world!
