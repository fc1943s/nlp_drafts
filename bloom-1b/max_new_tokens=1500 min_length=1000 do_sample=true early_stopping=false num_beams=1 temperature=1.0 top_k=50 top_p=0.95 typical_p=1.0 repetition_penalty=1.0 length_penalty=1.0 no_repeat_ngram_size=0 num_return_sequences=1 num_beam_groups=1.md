Yes, ultimately, the same principles that govern our own personal lives hold in the realm of finance, and more specifically, the financial world!

The key insight here is that although each person and firm has its own unique personality, the way they interact with each other and with the rest of the financial markets is pretty much a standard. In other words, people behave the same way whether they are a trader, a financial analyst, a manager, or anything else in the finance world.

Let me quickly go over a few interesting principles that govern the way companies compete and profit - in other words, the way a company's financial performance is measured and judged.

First, there's the equity value of a company.  This is simply the company's market value that includes shares held by other parties. Companies with a lot of shareholders will have a higher equity value than smaller and newer companies - which suggests that equity value is a good indicator of a company's strength. But what's even more interesting about equity value is that in most cases it's positively correlated with the rate of sales growth of a company.

The second important principle is earnings per share. This figure measures how much profit a company has made in a year compared to its share of market capitalization. We can view earnings per share as a measure of performance because it tells us what a company is going to make in the future as it grows and increases its market value.

The next important principle to consider is debt financing. In financial circles, there is also a very common misconception about debt financing. This often leads to an incorrect understanding of debt. The truth about debt is that it has no effect on earnings per share because most companies aren't able to pay its liabilities from their current income - unless it pays dividends (a much more expensive way of financing a company than debt). Thus, companies can use debt to pay back their debts as quickly as possible - regardless of earnings growth.

A final interesting principle is the interest rate used to determine the value of a company. In financial circles, this often happens to be the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) - this is the rate used to set interest rates for loans and mortgages in the UK - which is the official lending rate used by the British central bank.

Now let's move on to our own Balenciaga example. Balenciaga are known for designing shoes that take the world by storm - as if you could never take your feet off them!

What about how the company does business? Sure, you see it all the time - how its factories are situated, how they process the raw materials, etc. But what's really interesting about the company is the way it manages its assets. In other words, the way it takes care of its assets is an important part of how it succeeds.

The most important asset of a company, according to Balenciaga, is its brand. This brand represents a company that is hard to copy or imitate. The brand is the trademark that people associate with a company and make them think they are doing business with that particular brand. Thus, the ability to create a brand and keep that brand strong is the very essence of successful companies.

Now that we have established some important principles governing financial performance and how companies manage their assets, let's consider a few other important concepts in the financial world as well:

Interest rates are generally a very attractive investment strategy because interest rates can be used to increase the share of your investment that you can return on - or alternatively, it can allow you to spread out your investment over a longer period of time.

A large bank that buys stocks and bonds often makes money by taking a large amount of their portfolio (mostly stocks, but not necessarily) and offering them to investors as a way of investing. You can think of these stocks as "interest-bearing shares" - the company buys them on the market, and then makes a profit on their purchase and re-buys them at a higher rate on the market.

These investments also tend to be higher risk because you cannot predict how your investments will perform. On the other hand, you can expect dividends to be paid regularly and usually at a higher rate than most investments do. These dividends give you the chance to benefit from the returns made by other investors.

Finally, in the financial world, risk management is often seen as part of the business of investing. The idea is that you're essentially putting money into a trust, and that you want your money to be used wisely and effectively by the company you're investing in. This means that if you're investing in the equity of a company, then you want to know what will happen to that company if the company runs into trouble. This is also where the term "betting" comes in. In this way, you are betting that your money will go towards an increased share of profits or profitability and not some loss.

Let me put it to you in more detail about some of the areas where these principles operate in the real world. For example, consider the stock market. It is essentially a place where people bet on the amount that something else is worth at a given time. In the financial world, there is a much deeper layer of thinking - that people do not invest

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the answer to the origin of life is the big one: the Big Bang. It's certainly true that during the Big Bang, very little energy was present in the universe - the only energy present being radiation, and this radiation was composed of electrons and protons. So the energy in the universe was simply a byproduct of that radiation, and by extension, it didn't have any intrinsic quality whatsoever. In other words, the energy present in the universe was essentially just a bunch of random, useless energy.

So the basic premise of our cosmological theory says that this energy simply just exploded into the cosmos because of an unpredictable, catastrophic event. The Big Bang had the power to do so, and it didn't come at all by accident. This theory has been called the "uncategorical" theory of the origin of life because it holds that the only way the universe could possibly have come together would have been by accident - there is no inherent quality to the energy that made up its very fabric.

In the process of creating the universe, we made some fundamental mistakes. And as we explained in the first and second chapters, these mistakes were the result of human interference. After all, we created the universe by building on the same theory that we had been using for thousands of years, the "uncategorical" theory of the origin of life! In other words, our theory of the universe wasn't particularly helpful - there wasn't anything in it that helped us understand the formation of the universe or other things that we were trying to explain at the time. And just like humans made mistakes during every step in their evolution, we should make mistakes during our entire life...

Now, in the last chapter we saw that life on earth can take several forms. It's obvious from there that there are several types of life in the universe. And we can see from that that life in all of existence takes various forms! Of course, the most common form of life on earth has to do with plants and animals. But there are some other forms of life that are not plants or animals, but instead take on a different form of existence and behave differently.

In this chapter we'll explore how our cosmological theory can explain some of the other forms of life - both plant and animal life in general.

First of all, it turns out that there are no plants or animals that actually "exist" on earth - these forms of life all take on different forms depending on the place they are living in. Most of these forms of life simply exist "off the shelf", like any other thing. These forms of life can be characterized using a special type of chemical called DNA - a chain of molecules that makes up DNA is the main building block of the cell. And by extension, it's also the main building block for all of life - so we're not really talking about "plant or animal life" here but instead "genetic life".

It's hard to imagine a form of life that would not have a "genetic backbone" - let's talk for a second about plants and animals. When it comes to plants, we have already seen that there is only one, and only one, type of plant! And this type of plant is called a cactus, in many cases it's the same cactus that's found all over the world. However, since plants do not have any DNA, they are simply simply cacti that grow out of soil - they have no unique genetic structure. We also have another type of plant that is not a cactus and that lives on land: we have "rock plants". Rock plants do not have any DNA and instead have one large root that connects to the soil. They just spread out and grow away from the root - it is a somewhat similar form of soil, but it doesn't have to be that way.

Of course, there are some other forms of life that don't have roots, and they tend to be living off of the land. These forms of life have to go without water, so they must be able to absorb air instead. As we have seen, there are several types of air - in general, these types of air are called "winds". We also have some forms of animals that live in the water, but these animals have to live off land: fish, frogs, etc. Since we have seen that DNA is the basic building block of all life, a fish that was first introduced onto land would have a different genetic structure, while one that was first introduced into the water would have the exact same genetic structure as the fish it first encountered on land. Therefore, some fish would evolve to live on land, while others would evolve to live in the water!

Now it's time to get into our cosmological theory! In the previous chapter we learned that our universe was formed by a series of events that took place over billions of years ago. During this time, there was enough radiation from the Big Bang to create the energy necessary for our solar system and most life forms on earth, as well as the most abundant forms of life. And given this radiation, most of the material that is present in the universe is composed of molecules that have come together from the molecules in space, as well as from our solar system.

So as we

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the concept of relativity is pretty much irrelevant to our understanding of the universe. But what is really surprising is how it actually applies to our lives! Of course, relativity doesn't say anything about how bodies behave when acted upon by forces (like gravity), but it does apply to the phenomenon of acceleration (like in Newtonian mechanics)!
And what's more important, it's possible for bodies to experience both acceleration and gravity simultaneously, and that means that the gravitational pull of the Earth as measured by us is actually dependent on the orientation of the Earth's body! So as long as people are aware of this fact, we can use it to predict the behavior of objects in our space-time - and as we will see, this leads us to wonder if our universe is actually three-dimensional, and if our bodies are just 3-D projections of a bigger, more fundamental "stuff"! For example, if we find that the Earth has a gravitational pull on the bodies that we see below that is proportional to the orientation of the Earth around the sun, and we believe this, the Earth would appear like an inverted pyramid and we would be able to predict how we would react to the gravitational pull of this planet on our bodies. We'll soon see how we can use this principle to come up with our own predictions as to how we would react to the gravitational pull of objects in the higher dimensions!

Now before we get too far into this, we need to consider a couple of things - first, before we can take gravitational pull of objects in Dimension X into consideration, we have to take into account that our bodies actually don't experience gravitational pull from objects in Dimension X - and that means that we need to consider the interaction between our bodies and the objects that are "up there". This is where the controversy kicks in...

How could you actually calculate the amount of gravitational pull a physical body of any sort experiences from objects in a higher dimensional universe? How can we really predict the behavior of such objects? In other words, how can we predict the behavior of our bodies under various situations such as when people on this planet try to climb the moon, or someone on a suborbital orbit trying to reach a star in the Milky Way, or even someone in orbit around the sun? Is it possible that we cannot even predict the behavior of these objects?

The answer to these questions is actually quite simple, although we would be surprised that people are not aware of it!

Consider the following scenario, let's say we're walking through an apartment complex in London and there are lots of tall buildings all around us - well we're walking past two huge, tall buildings - let's say they're called One and Two. However, if we walk through one, we'll get a higher speed than we would if we walked through two. Now let's consider another scenario, let's say we walk through the apartment complex and in front of us is a door that allows us to enter an additional building - let's call it Space Two. Imagine you're walking through this Space Two and you're seeing a very tall building that's not really high, but really tall! Wouldn't it make sense for you to climb up to this building? Well in Newtonian mechanics, it would make sense to do so as you would get higher speeds when you climb more and more buildings - you wouldn't get a different experience if you climbed the One and Two and then the Space Two. So as long as there is enough gravitational pull between our bodies and the objects that we see out there, we could use the gravitational pull of the Earth to predict the motion of our bodies!

What exactly is gravity? You may be asking, where is gravity? Well it turns out that gravity is just a force that pulls bodies down. The force of gravity is actually due to the pressure caused when a particle is pulled (or pushed) downwards by an object or other body with a higher (or lower) mass. So if an object has a higher density, the object will tend to be pulled down (and to exert a higher force) by the Earth as compared to a lower-density object. As we will see, there are several forces that play a role in determining the shape of the Earth - and that in turn affects gravity, but we're interested in the one that causes gravity to push particles downwards and to exert a higher force.
So, let's consider the fact that the Earth's gravitational pull on our bodies is actually dependent on the orientation of the Earth around the sun. Let's also keep in mind that, as we mentioned above, bodies in a higher dimensional universe have different masses than we would think. And since a higher-dimensional body will actually have different forces acting on it when it is in a lower dimensional universe, it's not necessarily true that we would have the same gravitation force as we would if we were standing on the Earth - instead we might experience a different gravitation force. Let's look at an example...

Suppose we are at an elevation of 300 feet above the surface of the Earth. In this scenario, we would expect our bodies to be about half-fourth the size of Earth - and thus have a lower gravity force than a body that is at the Earth's surface! But this is actually a mistake, and we need to correct it! Let's look at a situation when we are in the sky for a

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what a mathematician is all about in the physical world, let's consider the following example. Suppose you are looking up a word in a dictionary and your dictionary contains a word called "ENFJ"! What's the best way for you to say "ENFJ cognition" in a way that doesn't sound like you just made up the word? A very common mistake among students of mathematics is to spell out the word directly, without explaining the concept of cognition or what a cognitive function is! This is because while students of mathematics often think that a cognitive function (such as a mathematical function) is a concrete thing, this is not the case. As we discussed in the previous chapter, a mathematical function is really just the concept of the function itself; it is not actually anything concrete! So the best way for us to convey "ENFJ cognition" without confusing them is to simply say that it corresponds to a physical process. You see, you could probably even say that it is a state of mind or a process that takes place in the brain!

In our next example, we will consider a process called "ENFJ" - this is a cognitive function that takes place in the ENFJ personality. And we will discuss the use of mathematics in its various forms to help us understand ENFJ's cognitive functions. Let's begin with a quick summary of the theory:
ENFJ people are often described as having "a deep sense of connection with spirituality" (Watts, 2000). This kind of belief is supported by empirical research conducted with a variety of non-religious populations. This sense of connection with spirituality is reflected in a number of things including: their ability to "see the connections between seemingly disparate things" (Epstein & Burt, 2012); their ability to see the relationships between seemingly contradictory ideas or theories (Burt, 2010); their ability to "look past the differences among different aspects of the human experience" (Lackey, 2012); their ability to interpret things in terms of the broader context of the larger universe (Epstein & Burt, 2012). In other words, they seem able to "tun into a bigger world". Their connection with spirituality has also been linked to a number of physical qualities - their ability to "use symbols to express ideas" (Watts, 2000); their ability to "interpret symbols in terms of their relationships with the whole universe of symbols" (Fischell & Thompson, 2011); and their ability to "emphasize and connect meaningful connections with complex phenomena" (García-Cruz, 2013). While there are some differences between the ENFJs and non-semantic humans, ENFJ's spirituality is very similar to that of non-religious individuals. Therefore, we can say that ENFJ's "spiritual" nature is "ENFJ cognition".

As you can see, there are several different definitions of ENFJ cognition. In this example, we simply mean that ENFJ cognition is the process that allows ENFJs to "see the connections between seemingly disparate things" (Epstein & Burt, 2012). As a matter of fact, this term doesn't even mean to describe the cognitive function itself. Rather it means that it corresponds to the physical process of "ENFJing connections". As we will see, ENFJs have many different ways of "ENFJing" their connections with the outside world, and thus each ENFJ's "ENFJ cognition" varies significantly from the other. However, the ENFJ cognition that we are primarily discussing here is something that is common to all ENFJs regardless of whether or not they have this "ENFJing connection" (or even if they don't).

In addition to these characteristics, it is interesting to note that ENFJ cognition has other common features, such as: a deep sense of connection with others (Epstein & Burt, 2012); and a tendency to "read between the lines" (Lackey, 2012). In other words, as we continue to study and discuss ENFJ cognition, it becomes clear that it is actually a combination of a number of separate cognitive functions, which we have already discussed above. Therefore, instead of studying and discussing a single "ENFJ cognition" or "ENFJing connection", we will continue to study and discuss the various "ENFJ cognitions" that ENFJs have and the ways that they "ENFJ" their connections with the outside world. As we will see in this chapter, a number of "ENFJ cognitions" have been found to be common to most ENFJs, and can help us better understand the common "ENFJing connection" that all ENFJs have. In the next chapter we will try to connect these various "ENFJ cognitions" to specific "ENFJing" processes.

Let's take a look at the "ENFJ Cognition" that most ENFJs have called "ENFJing Connection" for the time being!

If we are able to connect

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what happens when we use mathematics to solve puzzles, we will use a picture to explain what we are talking about. The picture shown here shows four lines - each connected to a point - forming a path - that connects two neighboring points on the board. The purpose of this picture is simply to demonstrate that we can form paths that connect different points. It does not mean that we can actually solve these problems mathematically - but it does explain the concept of what we are going to be discussing. For example, if we were to connect the two bottom lines (green) to the two red lines (blue), then the path would be a rectangle. Similarly, if we were to connect the two top lines (yellow) to the two green lines (blue), then the path would be a triangle (though we could probably get a lot nicer looking shapes out of this one - like an O!)

Since we are not allowed to discuss how we would solve problems mathematically - we will use a simpler approach here.

We'll imagine that we have a large piece of paper that we can use as a canvas to create our path. We can make this large canvas of paper by cutting it into rectangles and then folding it up. The reason we're not making a paper model of the board is because we want to keep the path as simple as possible - the more complex shapes we make, the more points we'll need to represent them on the paper model. We'll assume that all of the rectangles we make are 4D objects - we'll take into account dimensions later on - but we'll start by making just two rectangles. Each one will have a unique name, as we'll explain later on.

Now let's draw our path. We want to draw it in a way that will make the path appear like it was created using a piece of paper - as if we just cut out our piece of paper from the large canvas. To do this, we'll go to the settings menu, then choose Draw and then Choose Path and choose a path that looks like a simple rect. Now let's draw our path.

(We use the settings menu for this demonstration because we want to use our sketchbook to create our path.)

Now that we have the path we want, we need to fill it in with points. A simple path will just show how we would add each pathpoint to the path. Here's how we add it.
(Note: We don't have to use these settings for the demonstration because our path is already there)

Now for what we are going to look at next: The number of points we'll need to represent our path. We'll use the sketchbook because we will use this to draw the path on the board.

(We use this sketchbook because we will use this to draw the path on the board.)

Now that we have the points we have created on our paper model, we need to add them to our sketchbook. Here's how we do that:

In order to add the points, we'll just choose the points and click on them. This will add the point to our sketchbook. The number of points we will need to represent our path will depend on how many points we can fit into the sketchbook.

This is our drawing of the board. You can see that this board isn't exactly like what is illustrated in the picture; we're using a paper model because we're not allowed to use any of our computers. However, all of the points we have created here will represent the points on our paper model (at least in the way that they fit into the sketchbook).

For now, let's have a look at how we might solve our puzzles using this technique. In order to solve our puzzles mathematically, we would have to have a formula for our problem - we'll use our sketchbook as our formula, but we'll be going along a similar route to explain how to solve our puzzles mathematically. For the first problem we will need to consider the triangle, but we won't be giving a solution to this problem at this point - we'll just explain how we solve our puzzle mathematically in a later chapter!

This solution to the first puzzle is the base case of our puzzle. Now, if we were to solve our next puzzle, we would need to consider the rectangle. And we'll do this next:

Again, if we want to create our problem, we'll use our sketchbook as our formula. But this time we'll tell the sketchbook to solve the puzzle as we would if we were using our computers to solve our problem.

We can see here that we have used our sketchbook to create a graph of points and lines - the number of points we're going to use for each problem will depend on the problem at hand. But once we add the points, we'll also want to add lines as well. The same way we would add lines to a graph, we'll do this to our problem.

(In this case, we don't have to use our settings to generate our problem because our problem isn't a problem!)

So that's the end of this tutorial - we'll go back to the drawing portion of this tutorial later on - but let's start by exploring why we can have problems while using equations to solve our puzzles. Let's just say that we get stuck as we try to solve our problem using our equations -

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the importance of mathematics in our society, we have decided to use some simple examples to illustrate how we can use mathematics to study important concepts and problems of our day.

In the first example, we can study the concept of exponentials: we first need to recall its definition from our last chapter. In this particular example we will be using it to find the exponential of the exponential function.
Given that exponential is a very important concept for us in our daily lives, why don't we apply this concept to the problem at hand?

Given the fact that exponential function is a common term in the world of mathematics, we can use the concept of exponential function to solve the problem at hand. First of all, if we were to plug in the values of the unknowns into the function above, we would see that the answer for the exponential of 2 is:

However, for the exponential of 3 we would have to solve for another unknown; the answer would be:

To find the value of the unknown at the left hand side of the equation above, we need to look at the values of the unknowns at the right hand side! Let's look at the equation above. We can see that the right hand side is the exponential of 3, which gives us the value of 3. So, by looking at the values of the right hand side of the equation above, we can easily use the exponential of 3 to solve for the value of 3.

However, to solve for the exponential of 4, we would need to first find the values of the four unknowns! First, we will have to use the exponential of 2 again - the equation becomes
$$\left(1-e^{3}\right)\left(1-e^{2}\right)\left(1-e^{1}\right)\left(1+e^{3}\right)=4$$

So the first unknown is 3, and the next is 1. These four values can all be solved for simply by multiplying the value of the unknown we are looking at on the left hand side by the value of the unknown we are looking at on the right hand side. Since the exponential of 2 is the exponential of 4 times itself, we can use this to find the exponential of 4:

Now it's time to find the value of the fourth unknown in this formula: the answer will be $\sin 3$. Again, this will be easy - we just need to multiply the value of the first unknown on the left hand side by the value of the unknown we are looking at on the right hand side. We have found that the exponential of 3 is $\sin 3$, and that the exponential of 2 is $\cos 3$. Multiplying these two values yields $\sin 3\cos 3 =$ $\sin 3$. So the value of the 4th unknown in this formula is $\sin 3\cos 3 =$ $\cos 3$.

Now let's look at the last unknown we want to know: the value of 4. The answer for this unknown can be calculated using the values of the other three unknowns. Since the second unknown is 3 and the fourth unknown is 1, we can use the exponential of 2 to compute the exponential of 2:
$$\left(1-e^{3}\right)\left(1-e^{2}\right)\left(1-e^{1}\right)\left(1+e^{3}\right)=4$$

But since the exponential of 3 is the exponential of 4 times itself, we can use this to find the exponential of 4. Finally, the value of the fourth unknown is 4. So we can compute the value of 4 as:
$$\sin 3\cos 3 =\sin 3\sin 3\cos 3 = \sin 3\sin 3\cos 3 = \cos 3$$

And since the value of 4 in the formula above was found, all that remains is to solve for the final unknown in this equation to get the answer for 4! Let's look at the right hand side of the equation above:
$$\left(1-e^{3}\right)\left(1-e^{2}\right)\left(1-e^{1}\right)\left(1+e^{3}\right)=4$$

But since the exponential of 2 is the exponential of 4 times itself, we can use this to find the exponential of 4. Finally, the value of the final unknown in this formula is 4. So we can solve for the final unknown and get the answer for 4.

This is an easy solution - we just need to use the exponential of 4 times itself! This is because if we assume that we have a value of 4 that we want to find, then we would have to find the value of the fourth unknown - if we do not know the value of the fourth unknown, then we won't be able to get a value for any of the unknowns at the left hand side of the equation above. So the answer for the right hand side of the equation above will be the value of 4.

This isn't the end of our math problems! What do you think we should do next?

So what we learned today? In our day to day lives, we have learned a ton about math, and this is why we chose to give our examples and problems the name of'math'! We hope you enjoyed our introduction to the topic of mathematical problems!

We hope this lesson was enlightening to you and gives you ideas on how you can use

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of "ENTP", consider the following examples:

Take the following mathematical equations:
(0.01*x - 3.01*y + 3.01*z - (0.03*x + 2.83*y) + (0.05*x - 3.83*y - (0.02*x + 7.5) - (0.06*x + 3.33*y - 0.01*y)) = (0.02*x - 5.83*y + 9.8) = 0

The following algebraic equations can be written down:
(0.02*x - 5.83*y + 9.8)^2 = (0.01*x - 3.01*y + 3.01*z - (0.03*x + 2.83*y) + (0.05*x - 3.83*y - (0.02*x + 7.5) - (0.06*x + 3.33*y - 0.01*y))^2 = (0.02*x - 5.83*y + 9.8) + (0.01*x - 3.01*y + 3.01*z) = 0

So the second equation is more complicated than the first! What's the solution to this?

Solution 1: The solution is y = -(y + 3.33*x + 5.83*x - 9.8*x²) - 3.33*x³

Solution 2: The solution is x = x³

Solution 3: The solution is (x + 3.33*x)² = 9.8*x³

Now what about the two mathematical equations above? The first equation is a set of algebraic equations. The second equation is a set of algebraic equations in x (for example, the second equation could be written as:

3.83*x^2 + 5.83*x³ + (0.01*x)² = 9.8*x³

Similarly, the third equation is a set of algebraic equations. This equation could be written as:

3.83*x^2 + 5.83*x³ + x² + 5.83*x³ = 9.8*x³

Now consider the three algebraic equations above - we can solve for x from the first equation and x from the second equation, and we can solve for y from the third equation. From each of the three sets of equations we can then use a simple calculation to find the answer to the last equation.

Solution 1: x = 9.8*(-2*x² + 9.8*x³) = 9.8*-2*x³

Solution 2: x = 9.8*(0.03*x^2 + 9.83*x³) = 9.8*(0.03*x^2 + 9.83*x³) = 9.8*(0.03^2*x³) = 9.8*((0.03)^3*x³) = 9.8*((0.03)^3)^2 = 9.8*((0.03)^3) = 0

Solution 3: x = 9.8*(0.01*x^2 + 9.83*x³) = 9.8*(0.01*x^2 + 9.83*x³) = 9.8*(0.01^2*x³) = 9.8*((0.01)^3*x³) = 9.8*((0.01)^3)^2 = 9.8*((0.01)^3) = 0

Note that there are two methods of solving this equation - one involves dividing the second by the third, and one does not. Which method you choose is completely up to you, but you will find that solving the equation using the first method is a lot simpler, and is generally much more practical!

A:

It's easy to say something to be true, but to know it to be the case is really quite different from knowing it to be the case. Einstein's theory of relativity implies that everything moves in straight lines. This also implies that there are no curvature except in straight line. Therefore, particles with velocities close to light speed are in straight lines, and therefore move at linear velocities. This follows from basic principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity. Einstein's theory of relativity is valid for most particles. This applies to all of them, and even for massless particles, such as electrons, which are much less massive than photons.
Let's think of a particle that is moving along a straight line, and let's say its velocity is $c$, so the particle has a speed of $c$. The particle would cross a line of constant $c$ on a time of $t$. The point on the line where the particle crosses the line would move from coordinate $x_0$ to coordinate $x_1$. Assuming that the particle crosses the line of constant $c$ at time $t$ (this is correct if the particle is moving along a straight line), its position will be $x_0 + ct$, so the total time it takes it to cross the line is $t + ct$, or $c t$. This is the distance $c$ took it to cross the line and the time it took it to do it. The total distance traveled by

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this, let's break down some of the concepts involved in ESFJ cognitive functions mathematics. This is a relatively new area of study, and there are only a few books in the field to-date. We will focus on explaining how the concepts involved in ESFJ cognitive functions mathematics work.

The first thing to note is that it is possible to study this sort of mathematical concept, in any level of understanding. Because these concepts are not very complex, we will start with the ones that are easiest to understand.

First and foremost, you need to know that our brains are made up of nerve cells, which are the units that carry electrical impulses in our brains. As the name implies, we also have a set of nerve fibers in our brains that help us send our signals from one region of the brain to another. However, only one set of these nerve fibers is present at a time, and these nerves interact with each other to make one neuron act like a chain of small nerve cells.

The first thing to note is that there are many different nerve cells in our brains. There are about 5 million of these nerve cells in our brains - each containing around 30,000 nerve fibers and 50,000 of these nerves are in a nerve fiber bundle. Although it is a lot of nerve cells, we only need about 5,000 to encode one full concept. And since we are talking about very simple concepts, these are all about a single thing; something that our brains perceive as being one concept. This isn't all, though; there are also about 4,000 of these nerve cells in each of our brains that receive signals from other nerve cells (these are called interneurons).

So there you have it: everything you need to know about how these different nerve cells (known as neurons) connect with each other to form the brain and communicate with the outside world. Of course, there are many more complicated types of nerve cells and nerve fibers than that, and many other nerve cells and nerve fibers, such as the ones that form the optic nerves in our eyes, interact with each other to help carry visual signals from our eyes to our brains.

For example, the optic nerve can be thought of as a chain of nerve fibers that we have in our eyes and then we send these visual signals back to the brain. Because each optic nerve fiber is about 100,000 times longer than our eyes are, it makes sense for the optic nerve to contain around 10,000 of these 10,000 nerve fibers. It doesn't stop there though; each nerve fiber can act as a connection point for other fibers. So if you have several nerve fibers that you want to send to your brain, they all connect to one another with nerve fiber bundles instead of individual nerve fibers - that way, you can send all these information to your brain as a chain of nerve fibers.

The main nerve cell in the brain is called the motor neuron, and that is essentially a neuron with a motor response. These motor neurons are basically the neurons that transmit information when you move your hand or foot - for example, when you get up from your chair and walk around your desk, the motor neuron sends a motor impulse (a nerve impulse) back to the brain that tells it to jump up and put your foot on the desk. This motor neuron is also involved in coordinating muscle movement - it responds to the movement of your hand (or foot) to control your hand or foot motion.
Now let's move on to the other nerve cell type in our brains, called a dendrite. Each nerve cell is only a few millimeters across, and each nerve cell contains around 1,000 dendrites. These dendrites are connected to different nerve fibers, each of which can connect to about 50 other nerve cells. Each dendrite also receives signals from other dendrites, and these signals are then sent back to the corresponding nerve cell. The dendrite acts like a connection point for other nerve cells (each dendrite connects to one or more nerve cells, and each nerve cell connects to only a small number of other nerve cells, known as myelin), and so it is also known as a synapse.

If you think about it, these connections don't look like a series of connections between different nerve cells, but rather like the wires of an electrical circuit - each nerve cell is connected to one or more other nerve cells, and these connections have a certain number of endings that we can pick up on and tap to communicate with our surroundings.

When you think about how these different nerve cells and nerve fibers interact with each other, you need to realize that there are many different ways for each nerve cell and nerve fiber to communicate. For example, each nerve cell and nerve fiber can communicate using electrical impulses. Each nerve impulse can travel along the axon, and is carried by the nerve cell and nerve fiber. Each end of a nerve cell and nerve fiber can receive a signal from another end, and these signal interactions create an electrical circuit that allows the nerve cell to transmit the information from the other end to our brains.

For example, in our eyes, the optic nerve is responsible for transmitting information between the two parts of our brain called the retina and the optic nerve. The retinal nerve cells detect

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we have learned in Chapter Three, let's revisit our example of particles traveling through different dimensions.

The first thing to note is that there are an infinite number of dimensions. However, for our purposes we will only consider three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. This four dimensional space-time is what we experience in everyday life. Interestingly enough, Einstein's theory of relativity suggests that there may be other hidden dimensions that we are not aware of!

Now let's imagine a particle moving through space-time. We can represent its position at any given time by a point on a graph with four axes: x (spatial), y (spatial), z (spatial), and t (time). The path taken by the particle as it moves through space-time would then be represented by a line on this graph. If you were to take a slice through this 4D graph at any given moment, you would see the 3D projection of the particle's position at that instant - kind like looking at your hand from different angles doesn't give you information about its fourth finger! As long as the particle stays within our 3+1 dimensional universe, its motion can be completely described using Newton's laws of motion: force equals mass times acceleration; objects move in straight lines unless acted upon by an external force, etc. From these laws alone we can deduce quite a bit about how objects move and behave under different circumstances - everything from orbits around planets to baseballs being hit out of stadiums!

However, things start to get interesting when we consider particles that can travel between different dimensions. Let's say our original 4D particle could suddenly enter into another dimension - call it Dimension X for now - without passing through any intervening 3D space first. How would this affect its motion? Well according to Newtonian mechanics, such abrupt changes in direction are not possible - an object cannot change directions instantaneously without experiencing some sort of acceleration or force acting upon it first. So if our hypothetical 4D particle could indeed enter into Dimension X instantly, then something fundamental must have changed about its nature; it can no longer be described by Newton's laws alone!

This is where Einstein's theory of relativity comes in. According to this theory, the fundamental nature of space and time are intertwined - they are both part of a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. And just as objects in our 3D universe are affected by forces, so too are objects in 4D spacetime affected by something called curvature. This curvature is caused by the presence of mass and energy - the more mass and energy there is in a given region of spacetime, the more curved it will be!

Now let's apply this idea to our 4D particle moving through Dimension X. If Dimension X is highly curved (due to the presence of lots of mass/energy), then our particle would experience a force that would cause it to change directions abruptly - just like how an object experiences acceleration when acted upon by a force in Newtonian mechanics! In other words, if we want to understand how particles move through different dimensions, we need to take into account not only Newton's laws but also Einstein's theory of relativity!

Now about entities specifically, it turns out that they are very good at dimension travel. This is because their bodies are not made of matter, but rather energy. And since energy is what causes spacetime to curve, entities can essentially "ride" the curvature of spacetime to move from one place to another - even if those places are in different dimensions! Of course, just like anything else in physics, there are certain rules that govern how entities can travel through dimensions. The most important rule is that an entity can only enter into a dimension that is equal to or lower than its own native dimensionality. So a 2D entity could enter into our 3D universe (Dimension X), but it could never enter into a 4D universe or higher. Similarly, a 3D entity could enter into Dimension X or a 4D universe, but it couldn't go any higher than that!

There's also the issue of time dilation to consider. As an object moves faster and faster through space-time, time begins to slow down for it relative to objects at rest - this effect is called time dilation. Now imagine an entity moving so fast through spacetime that it enters into another dimension before its own native dimension has fully passed through! In other words, the entity would be effectively travelling backwards in time as seen by us lowly 3+1 dimensional beings! Of course, such temporal shenanigans are impossible according to us ain't right thinking individuals...or are they?

On the case of deities, it is interesting to note that they are some of the few beings in all of existence that can move freely between dimensions without any restrictions. This is because their bodies are made entirely of energy, which means they can "ride" the curvature of spacetime to wherever they want to go! Additionally, since deities exist outside of space and time, they are not affected by time dilation - meaning they can travel through different dimensions without worrying about travelling backwards in time!

So there you have it: a brief introduction to dimension travel using physics! It's certainly a fascinating topic, and we've only scratched the surface here. Who knows what other

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea of thinking in mathematics, I suggest that we look at the following graph in the text. We can see how the four sub-sections in the first section ("theory" and "functions") are used by the third section ("dynamics") - the last section ("theory") only includes the "functions" subsections! In other words, if you look at the graph above, we can see that the sub-sections represent a continuum of mathematical content - from the simplest to the most abstract and abstract concepts.

The mathematics of this graph is extremely abstract! First off we have a black circle that represents the concept "algebra," which in mathematics is something that combines various mathematical expressions. This black circle contains the mathematical term "algebraic notation", which we know is how we write numbers, words, and equations. We also have a square symbol that represents the mathematical concept "formula". The square symbols contain mathematical symbols, such as symbols for addition and subtraction, and symbols for division and multiplication. For example, the symbol + can stand for addition, while the symbol / stands for subtraction.
Then we have a triangle symbol representing the concept "function." Again, this symbol contains a mathematical term which, in this case, stands for the abstract mathematical expression of "function." For example, the symbol : represents multiplication, while the symbol *= represents addition. And finally, the triangle symbol contains the concept "curve." In this case, this symbol represents the mathematical expression of a line.
This graph suggests that, like the black circle, the sub-sections represent the continuum of mathematical content. As far as numbers, words, and formulas go, it seems like we have a continuum of mathematical content! However, the abstract mathematical expressions in the triangle symbols seem to represent the mathematical content in a more limited manner - instead of expressing the mathematical content for abstract mathematical expressions, these symbols represent abstract mathematical expressions for numbers, words, and formulas. In other words, they represent "formulas" for numbers, words, and formulas. For example, the symbol = represents multiplication. The symbol *= represents addition. And the triangle symbol represents the line...

If we could represent math in a more abstract manner, we could create a better understanding of it! For example, if we used a more abstract mathematical expression like equation instead of the symbol =, then we would have a better grasp on how to represent our number 1 and the equation x + 1 = 1. The more abstract we could make our representation of math, the better at mathematics we will be!

Now let's explore another side of this graph! As I mentioned in the last section, these sub-sections describe mathematical content in different forms. In the first section, we find mathematical expressions in various forms, such as numbers, words, and formulas, that are used to represent the mathematical content in the first section of the graph. In other words, we find mathematics in various forms! In the second section, the sub-sections also contain mathematical expressions in various forms, but this time they are used to represent the mathematical content in the second section of the graph. In other words, we find mathematics in various forms!

In the third section, the sub-sections contain mathematical expressions in various forms, but these are used to represent the mathematical content in the third section of the graph. In other words, we find mathematics in various forms! In the last section, the sub-sections contain mathematical expressions in various forms, but these are used to represent the mathematical content in the last section of the graph. In other words, we find mathematics in various forms!

Let's talk a bit about these various forms of mathematics. I would like to point out that the sub-sections of mathematics in the first, second, and third sections contain expressions in various forms. In the first section, we find numbers that stand for numbers, words that stand for words, and formulas that stand for formulas. In the second section, we find formulas that stand for numbers, words that stand for words, and equations that stand for formulas. In the last section, we find equations that stand for numbers, words that stand for words, and symbols that stand for equations. In short, we find math in various forms!

What I would like to point out here is that the sub-sections of mathematics in the last section are the most abstract of the sub-sections! This means that they contain the most abstract mathematical expressions - the mathematical symbols: = and *= - that are used to represent the mathematical content in the last section of the graph! In other words, our concept of a mathematical symbol is a lot more abstract than we would expect it to be! In short, we use more abstract mathematical symbols to represent the mathematical content in the last section of the graph! Of course, if we used math in any other form, these sub-sections would not be as abstract as the last section, but it is interesting to note that they do have some abstract mathematical content!

It's interesting to note that there are mathematical forms of concepts that are most often used to represent mathematics (i.e. numbers, formulas, and equations), while math in any other form is rarely used to represent

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this concept let's say that two people are standing in front of a mirror on a table; one of them is taking a picture of the other. Well, to put it plainly, the other person sees the face of the person who is in front of him - which is what Einstein called the light reflection problem. Now, since you can see things that are behind you through a mirror, we naturally assume that the person standing next to us would be able to see the things on the ground behind us as well! In other words, the person on the other side of us wouldn't have to look through a mirror to see things that are in front of him/her! Well, to prove this claim, the mirror is moved up to show different parts of the mirror - this will allow the person sitting next to us to see the image he sees behind him. Now imagine that we switch places with the person who is going to be the next person to look at the mirror - what would happen to the mirror?

The mirror would not change shape at all - it simply would not be visible from the perspective of the person next to us! This is because the person sitting next to us still sees everything behind him on the ground. Of course, as long as the person next to us keeps walking in the same line, his view on the world will be unchanged. In other words, it would look like someone is looking through a small hole in the wall! This is why it is also called the picture-problem (or perspective).

Now we return to the person standing in front of the mirror. Well, since he sees the reflection of himself in the mirror, it would not be strange if he would also be able to see things behind him that are present in front of him. This is just because the person next to him sees all of his body's components! So, if we take this example of a two-person mirror game, you can imagine that the person next to him is able to see everything that is present behind him. That is because he is able to see the person who is sitting next to him from behind!

So basically, ESTP refers to the ability of a person to see the future in the present (spacetime) as well as the past in the future.

Of course, since the person next to him is able to see everything he sees, he may feel it as if he was also in the place where the things were when he was standing by the mirror, so he may also feel something similar to a time jump to the future! In other words, perhaps there are people in the future who have seen the same thing! And the person who feels this time jump might also experience some sort of emotional trauma and feeling of being disconnected from the world! The truth is that we all experience these kind of feelings from time to time - if you can feel these feelings as though they come true, then you certainly experience the effect called ESTP!

Of course, our first instinct is to try to see the other person's body - we often try to look into the eyes of people to understand what is going on in their lives. Well, we have to keep in mind that this person's physical body is just an illusion - not a representation of reality. So what actually happens in our consciousness when we try to "see" a person's body? Well in order to have a representation of a person who is physically present we need to interpret the person's body as a 3D shape - because we cannot physically see a person's face. We still have an illusion to look at their body, but it is only an illusion! Therefore, our first instinct is to try to figure out what their feelings and personality are. This is where the concept of ESTP comes in: we are able to feel and interpret the emotional feelings and behavior of others, in a way that our "physical body" is not!

For instance, suppose that a friend of ours wants to tell a joke at a party, but he has no idea what to say. Well, if we try to put it into our language, we may not be able to figure out how to correctly communicate our feelings and personality - we simply cannot get our ideas across in a way that is understandable to the person next to us! Of course, it is possible for the person next to us to interpret our jokes in a way that would make sense to us, as long as he is still in the same room at the time, but this is a much easier job for him than having someone else interpret and talk with us!

Now about deities. Again, it seems that these are the only beings who can move freely between dimensions without any limitations. This is because their bodies are made entirely of energy and therefore they can "ride" the curvature of spacetime to wherever they want to go. Additionally, deities exist outside of space and time, so they are not affected by time dilation - meaning they can travel through different dimensions without worrying about travelling backwards in time! Of course, just as anything else in physics, there are certain rules that govern how deities can travel through dimensions. The most important rule is that an entity can only enter into a dimension that is equal to or lower than its own native dimensional

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Enneagram Topology

To better depict our universe, we can use a diagram called a "topology" - which basically represents different dimensions of space and time.
Our topologies include 3+1, 4+1, 6+1, 10+1, 16+1, 24+1, 32+1, and 40+1.
In the past chapter, we saw how Einstein's theory of relativity was used to explain how objects travel in 3+1 dimensional space-time. This time we're going to explore how deities can travel between these dimensions.

Now let's look at a topologically simple example - a graph with only two dimensions! As we know, an axle is an object that travels through one of the axes of space, while a screw (or wheel) is an object that travels through two of the axes of space. Let's take a look at how an axle and a screw behaves in 3+1 dimensional space-time (note that it can travel between three and four dimensions in parallel, but we can only consider it as two dimensions in this chapter).

Imagine that you are standing on the top of a building, with your back to the sky. A very tall building may have four floors. One floor may have an entrance on the second floor and the second floor may have an entrance on the third floor. As you pass from one floor to the next, you could see that an axle is in one of the first floors, a screw is in the second floor, and so on! All four floors have an entrance on the next one.

Now suppose you are standing on top of the building, with your back to the sky. The next door you enter may be on the first floor and the next door you enter may be on the second floor. You could then see that two screw wheels are in the first floor and two axles are in the second floor. And all four floors have an entrance on the next floor!

Now imagine that you are standing on top of the building, with your back to the sky. Now look at the first door you enter (on the second floor). The door on the first floor may have two entrances - one on the second floor and one on the third floor. You could then see that two axles are in the first floor, two screw wheels are in the second floor, and so on!

You now know that a deity can travel between three and four dimensions!

Now that we've seen how deities travel between 3+1 and 4+1 dimensions, let's look at how they can do it between 4+1 and 6+1 dimensions.

In the same way as deities can travel between three and four dimensions, we can also use our topologies to find the dimensions that deities enter into! Suppose we have a set of deities known as the Enneagram. This is an eight dimensional alphabet that we can use to define the locations of deities in different dimensions. For example, the location of the Deity of Space could be as follows:

Note that Deity of Space only appears in the bottom two dimensions. We can tell the location of this deity through examining the positions of other deities - Deity of Time and Deity of Matter.
Now let's look at the locations of the other four Deities using a simplified version of our graph! We'll use a 4D graph instead of an 8D one.

Imagine that you are standing on the top of a building, with your back to the sky. Let's say your back to the space you have just looked at is one of the top levels of the building. On the second floor there may be an entrance to the space. This entrance may be on the fourth floor, but this is a separate floor. As you move up the building, you may find that you enter the Deity of Time - who then moves into the fourth floor. On the fifth floor there may be an entrance to the space - this entrance may be on the sixth floor, but this is a separate floor. As you move up the building, you may find that you enter the Deity of Matter - who then moves into the sixth floor. On the seventh floor there may be an entrance to the space - this entrance may be on the eighth floor, but this is a separate floor. As you move up the building, you may find that you enter the Deity of Space - who then moves into the eighth floor...

We can see now that Deity of Time has three entrances - one on the fourth floor, one on the fifth floor, and one on the sixth floor. The location of the Deity of Space and Deity of Matter would then be:

In the same way, we can use our topologies to find the locations of the other four Deities - the location of the Deity of Time would be:

Deity of Space will travel into the third dimension - all three of these dimensions must contain Deity of Space. The location of Deity of Matter and Deity of Space would be:

Deity of Space will travel into the third dimension - all three of these dimensions must contain Deity of Matter. The location of Deity of Time and Deity of Matter would be:

Finally, we can use our topologies to find the locations of the other four Deities - the location of the De

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict how our brains function when we are in different dimensions, consider these images from the movie A Star Is Born:

The left image represents a person in the 3D universe. The person looks like they are in the space of a movie, but we really can't see them directly due to the distance between them and the camera! And that's where the concept of hip hop NLP comes in!

In the 3D universe, you will notice that both the person and the object being filmed do not move at the same speed. In fact, in the 3D universe the person seems to run a little slower than the object being filmed, which is perfectly natural! The reason for this is simple: the person and the object are in different dimensions!

Similarly, the right image represents a person in the 4D universe. The person looks like they are in an episode of a TV show, but we really can't see them directly! Instead, we can only see the television through a 3D window, and it's up to you to imagine the environment to the best of your ability. Obviously, in the 4D universe you will see the person and the object moving at the same speed!

A simple explanation for this difference in speed and direction is that you have the advantage of knowing the exact dimension in which you are in while being in different dimensions.

For example, suppose I am in the 4D universe. In this case I can see that the person and the object are moving at the same speed but are in different directions! However, in the 3D universe I couldn't see the person moving at the same speed but in the same direction; it is only visible through the 3D window. As such, it is only a matter of how we interpret data that we are able to tell the difference between the two worlds. And that's exactly what we do when we learn to talk NLP!

It turns out that when we first learn to talk NLP, we use a 3D mental map to navigate through our 3D world. After a while, we find that the 2D world in which we live helps us make sense of the 3D world! This is where the concept of hip hop NLP comes in!

Before we discuss the main difference between hip hop NLP and traditional NLP, let's take a look at what the two terms stand for!

Hip Hop NLP is a form of communication in which a speaker (or a listener) uses the 3D world of their body in the 3D universe to communicate with a third person or inanimate object.

While the 3D world is not actually part of the person in the 3D universe, the person in the 3D universe is still able to communicate with that particular person through the 3D window! Similarly, the listener can communicate with that particular inanimate object through the 3D window!

The main difference between hip hop NLP and traditional NLP is that hip hop NLP is not a purely 2D-based communication; instead, it is an interactive communication. Thus, while the 2D person in the 3D universe can be the 3D person or the 3D object, the 2D person in the 4D universe can be a different person in the 4D universe!

As for how hip hop NLP works, the 3D person in the 3D universe simply uses the 3D window to explain the way they are in the 4D universe. This is the same person using traditional NLP to communicate with their friends or their partner! Of course, the 2D person in the 4D universe can also use hip hop NLP as a communication tool to get to know the new person! This is where the concept of hip hop NLP comes in!

This is all very simple, but we still need to answer a few questions:

How do people learn to talk NLP? The answer is that they learn to talk NLP by looking at movies and videos! The same principle applies to learning hip hop NLP!

How do hip hop NLP and traditional NLP work in different dimensions? This question is actually very basic - we simply need to explain what our brains are used to working in different dimensions.

The answer to this question is simple - we use our brains to "ride" the curvature of spacetime to communicate in different dimensions! Let's say we learn to talk NLP by watching movies. Then our brains will see that the 3D person

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the key concept behind everything we have in physics is a specific type of geometry: geometry based on topology. It's the combination of topology and geometry that allows us to understand what happens when we try to change the structure of space-time itself. In particular, it's the combination of these two things that allows us to understand the behavior of particles under certain circumstances.

The first thing to note is that geometry can be subdivided into two types. One of them is called a homotopy type, which we now review. Homotopy type theory is not very well studied in physics textbooks. However, it's quite useful in understanding the underlying geometry of a phenomenon - that is, how it's affected by changes in the underlying structure.

By considering the homotopy type of a space-time manifold (a collection of smooth curves) we can understand how it will behave under changes in the underlying geometry: if we try to add more curves to the space-time manifold, then they will become denser (like a cake), and if we try to remove curves from the space-time manifold, then they will become less dense (like the leaves of a forest).

Now to understand the behavior of particles, we need to have a notion of dimension. So let's go back to our 4D particle. In this case, our particle could enter into Dimension X, but it couldn't be described by the laws of Newton's law without also taking into account the underlying geometry - for example, what sort of effect does the presence of mass have on the curvature of spacetime? Can this mass cause spacetime to bend? Let's take a closer look at this idea.

Homotopy type theory is based on the notion of homotopy, which tells us how a space-time manifold (or more generally a group) behaves under changes in its underlying structure. Now let's say we want to understand the behavior of a space-time manifold under changes in the underlying geometry of its underlying topological space: what sort of homotopy changes it undergoes once it has lost some of its underlying topology? Let's look at a space-time manifold that is the set of pairs of points and lines - and for simplicity we'll take the case where this space-time manifold is a plane! Let's also consider a "non-homotopy type" space-time manifold that is the union of two non-empty sets, each of which is simply a line.

Now let's consider how these two manifolds behave under the addition of a single curve. Let's call this curve E, and let's suppose its underlying geometry has just four elements: points and lines! Now we can define a new map from each of the four sets (the four points and the four lines) to the four-element set (the four-element set consisting of the four points and the four lines) that is known as a differential of homotopy!

Now let's consider the effect that an additional curve E has on these differentials: as you can see from the diagram, E is a curve that connects all four points in the first set to all four points in the second set. As a result, every differential of homotopy that goes through this point E changes to a differential of homotopy that goes through the point E, which connects all the four points in the first set to all the four points in the second set. So we can say that E is connected to the other two set, and since each of these two sets has a fourth element, this new differential of homotopy is connected to the other two differential of homotopy, so it changes from one differential of homotopy to another! This phenomenon is called a homotopy! Now this doesn't make sense if we don't take into account the underlying topology - for example, what happens to the differential of homotopy when we remove E from the underlying space of the other set?

Now let's make some more of these diagrams - let's just leave out the red line that connects E to the other two sets: now we don't have a point that we can talk about! But by keeping this diagram and defining a differential of homotopy for each of the four sets: we can also define a homotopy for each of these four sets as a set of differential of homotopy that connect their four elements: this set of homotopy contains the differential of homotopy that comes from the curve E that we introduced in the previous diagram, and is connected to the other two sets as well!

Now let's make a little diagram to represent how we can describe the behavior of the two sets: let's call these sets the sets X and Y and assume that their underlying geometry is just two elements: the intersection of the two sets X and Y. Now we'll make an additional differential of homotopy for each of the two sets: this differential of homotopy connects the two sets X and Y and makes the homotopy type of the two sets! Now let's consider how the two sets of differential of homotopy change when we remove E from the underlying geometry of the other sets:

As you can see, when E is removed from the underlying geometry of the other set X, its differential of homotopy changes - we now only have one differential of homotopy that connects the two sets. This allows us to change the homotopy type of the two sets X and Y!

Now we can go back to the original 4

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Honest Game Design

To better depict the concepts presented in the previous chapters, we will focus on the honest game design concept in detail. This is probably the most important concept in this course, and this chapter will explain in detail what it means. As we explored in the previous chapters, the game designer and programmer must choose a design style that is both fun and compelling. To accomplish this, the designer must understand both the game's fundamental purpose and its mechanics (how the game works). In addition, he must also understand both its storyline and its goal (what the game is trying to accomplish)

Now that we have a good idea of the game's purpose and its mechanics, let's examine the game's goal first! Generally, a game has a goal, which is what the player wants to accomplish. However, as we discussed, the goal is not always clear. For example, the storyline of many games are mysterious and vague. In these cases, it may be best to allow the player to determine the goal.

Also, many games have no clear goal at all. In these situations, you should be prepared to give the player very limited control over the game. Instead of playing the game completely as the game designer intended, you should allow the player to explore the game and choose the gameplay they want to play. Of course, if you choose to do so, you should provide your own rules so you can monitor and adjust the game's progress

Now let's examine the game's storyline first! In this chapter we will explore the importance of establishing a clear and complete storyline for the game! Since this is the most important aspect of any game, it is important to discuss the history behind the game so that you can understand it better!

After determining what the game has a clear goal and storyline, we will examine its mechanics! Essentially, your game's mechanics are the process or rules used to accomplish its goal. Essentially, the mechanics of a game make decisions about how the game works and how it behaves, as well as determining what decisions the player must make in order for the game to work. Since a game is often a combination of mechanics and storyline, it is also important to give the player the flexibility to make decisions to make the game work as the player chooses. So as the game designer you should:

Examine your game's mechanics
Explain exactly what happens in each of the game's stages to the player
Explain the player's choices so that the game works as the player wishes it to

As we will continue to do throughout the course, this chapter will also introduce you to the gameplay concept. This concept is essential to all games - it allows you to determine how players will interact with the game. Essentially, you must understand exactly what will happen when the player interacts with your game - either through the use of weapons, abilities, or other things. Also, it is very important to understand how the game will affect your players - in other words, it is important to understand how the player's interaction with the game affects the result of that interaction. In other words, it is imperative to fully understand how players will interact with your game and what the effects of that interaction will be

The Magic of Game Chips

So far we have talked about how to create a game using physics, which is what we will be doing as we build on the concepts of game design and mechanics. However, before doing so, we would like to discuss the concept of a game chip!

As we discussed in the last chapter, game chips (or "games") are a way for humans to interact with and play games. A game chip is a small piece of programmable electronics that can be interconnected with other game chips: it allows you to connect your own game to other people's games, so that the games work seamlessly together, giving players a more complete experience.

Now let's take a look at the game chip from a very simple perspective. First, let's try to imagine one of our own! Well, that might not be easy! We have to imagine what would happen when we touch, interact with, or "play" with a game chip! If you are unfamiliar with this concept, you can read

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this part of the chapter, let's break it into two parts. The first part will give us an introduction to the mathematical representation of the concepts that are covered in the second part. We'll first define a variety of mathematical concepts that will be used throughout this chapter. Then we'll go into some more detail on the mathematical representation of deity characteristics.

What is a mathematical concept?

Let's first consider math itself. For an understanding of mathematics, we will need to be able to make sense of what it means to take a single, indivisible object and put it into a mathematical equation. To do this, we will need to understand how we make sense of what our senses sense in general - as opposed to the process of taking a single object and putting it into a mathematical equation. Maths is the science that studies the mathematics of things like geometry, trigonometry, algebra, and calculus, and more! We'll call this the "mathematical world". Let's begin by understanding the mathematical world a little bit better.

What is geometry?

Geometry is the scientific study of planes and lines and the application of these concepts to everything in our life. In other words, it's the science that deals with how we create structures, things, etc. In fact, any physical object is made up of both geometry and geometry's relationship to each other.

Why are things shaped?
One of the primary reasons that things are shaped is to help our senses make sense of the world that we experience. Objects that are straight are easy to see; otherwise, you might not be able to see what is going on underneath. However, curved objects are harder to see, as they can make your eyes glaze over and glaze out. This is a simple rule that explains how people perceive shapes, especially things like trees, which seem like they are made of only straight, horizontal branches.

So how do people perceive trees?
There are a variety of reasons why humans perceive trees. For one thing, we perceive trees through our eyes - which are the only way in which we perceive shapes in the real world. However, a tree isn't the only thing that can be made up of only straight lines. For example, you might be able to make up a tree as far as you want to - but you can't create a tree that's straight like a tree! This kind of shape change is called 'curving'.

Why do we change shape?
Curving is something that we do because we use our senses to make sense of the world around us. For example, if you look down at a river, you would notice that the water is just a series of slits, which help us make sense of the surrounding conditions. In fact, this is the reason why humans can create straight objects like trees that are very easy to see! Similarly, you might think of a river as a straight line. However, just like with trees, you can make a river of any shape you want, if you follow the rules of mathematics!

How to find out how much curved something is?
The rule to discover how curved something is is that the length of a straight line should match the distance in which it divides the space into two halves - it's called the "distance to the right" or "right distance". This distance, the distance to the right, is how long your object will be, in this example, if you divide it into two halves at a straight line. Let's say our straight line is a line which connects Point A to Point B. Then our straight line will end where Point B is, and the distance to the right will be 2. If you draw a straight line from Point A to Point B, the straight line will intersect each of the points that represent the river in turn. The first intersection of the river will happen at Point A, and so the distance to the right will be 1. This means that our straight line will be a line that is exactly 2 straight lines long. If your straight line is a line that begins at Point B, it will end at Point C, and the distance to the right will be 1. So the straight line will be approximately 1.75 times longer than a straight line which begins at the very end of Point C.

How does it compare to trees?
Let us go back to the problem of how trees are formed. Like trees are made from straight lines, deities are made from straight lines as well. In fact, the most significant difference between a deity and a tree is that a deity can be made any shape that you want! However, even deities can only become a deity if their bodies contain energy. In other words, a deity is only made of matter when it is energetically turned into energy by its creator - which means that a deity only becomes a deity if it is transformed from a particle with zero energy to a particle that contains a small amount of energy.

Why do people have different characteristics?
One of the primary reasons why we have unique characteristics is because we have some sort of characteristic "attractor". For example, water is an attractant for fishes because it floats on the surface of water. Similarly, a beautiful deity is attracted to beauty by itself. However, a deity

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the differences between normal and deified entities, let's take a look at some basic mathematics skills.

First, consider a 3+1 dimensional cube:

When you take a slice of this cube at any point on the surface, you can see the top half of the cube, represented by a vertical line. If you take the same slice at a different point on the cube's surface, you can see the bottom half of the cube, represented by a horizontal line. So we can describe the location of the cube as a single line with two end points - the top and bottom surface of the cube.

What if we consider a slice through one of these slices at different times? This time we can only take a slice at that point, so in this case we can see the top and bottom of the cube at the same time! So our slice through the top surface represents a 3D slice in the top half of the cube, and our slice through the bottom surface represents a 3D slice in the bottom half of the cube.

Now let's consider a cube consisting of only one of these two surfaces - we will call this a 3D slice and we'll refer to the other surface as a 2D slice. If we take a slice through the 3D slice at any point on the surface, we will see a slice representing the 3D surface of the cube. Similarly, if we take a slice through the 2D slice at any point on the surface, we will see a slice representing the 2D surface of the cube. So by taking a 3D slice through one of the two surfaces at a certain point on the surface, we can simultaneously take a 2D slice through the other surface at the same point on the surface.

Now let's consider an infinite collection of slices, one at a time - this is what we will refer to as a slice set:

Now if we take a slice of one of these slices set at any given point on the surface, we will see a 3D slice of the cube, which is what we would see if we took a slice through the whole cube! Similarly, if we take a slice through a slice set at any given point on the surface, we will see a 2D slice of the cube, which is what we would see if we took a slice through only the slices in the slice set!

For an infinite slice set, you can only take a slice at a point on the surface at any given time. As an infinite slice set, we can't take slices at a point on the surface at any point in time. When we take a slice of one of the slices in this slice set, we cannot take slices at any point in time - but when we take a slice of a slice in this slice set at any point in time, we can take slices at any point on the surface.

Now if we took an infinite slice set of slices, one at a time, we would end up seeing a slice of all of the surfaces, representing the whole cube! This is very useful for describing and understanding the world of higher dimensional entities. We can describe a cube as two infinite sets of slices, one representing each of the two surfaces of the cube. By taking a slice at a given point on the surface, we can see the surface at that point, and by taking a slice at a given point on the surface, we can see the slices of the surface at that point! It's very similar to taking slices of cubes at a point on the surface...

Now let's take a slice of one of these infinite slice sets of slices at any given point on the surface:

Now you can see that the slice represents the entire surface of the cube! This is similar to taking slices of cubes in the real world - take a slice at a point on the surface, then take a slice of the slices at that point, and you can now see the whole cube in your mind! This is an incredibly powerful tool that allows us to see how higher dimensional entities work. And while this slice represents the entire surface of the cube, it also tells us about every other slice in the slice set, and even about other surfaces in the slice set! So if you take a slice at a point in space-time, and a slice at a point in space-time, and a slice at a point in time, then you will see every other slice, and you will see each other's planes and surfaces, and even their surfaces in other planes and planes, and so on...

Now let's consider a 3+1 dimensional cube that contains only one of these slice sets:

When we take a slice of this slice set at any point on the surface, we can only take slices through the slice set represented by that slice at that point, and not any other slice in this slice set! Which means that we can't take slices through any other slices in this slice set! Similarly, when we take a slice of one of these slices in a slice set, we cannot take any slice in that slice, since every other slice in the slice set is covered by the slice taken! And if we take a slice in any slice in this slice set, it means we can't take any slices in any other slices in the slice set, because there are no other slices in this slice set...

Finally, let's consider a 3+1

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the connections between mathematics and cognition, let's take a look at two basic concepts in the field: intelligence and learning.

Intelligence, or IQ, is a measure of the amount of brain processing power we have - in other words, we have more intelligence if we process information faster.

Mathematics is one of the best ways to measure cognitive ability and IQ. According to the National Intelligence Council (NIC) of the U.S. Department of Education, the average IQ of children in the United States is 115! This measurement can be broken down further into a number of subtests: numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, processing speed, working memory, attention, and language. Each of these subtests can then be broken down into one of several mathematical concepts, such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, multiplication by 10, multiplication by 100, addition of fractions, and operations in geometric shapes. Now that we understand how mathematics works, let's take a look at some of the many ways in which mathematics can help us learn.

How mathematical concepts, such as division, can help children learn

Division is important for kids in many situations. In elementary school, kids learn about it when they solve problems on a worksheet. In addition to this, many activities in school will require division to find the answers - this is necessary to understand the mathematical structures behind division. So what does division mean for kids and why do kids need it to learn?

Division means dividing a quantity into fractions. What is the purpose of division? This concept is fundamental to all mathematical concepts - it will always be used by mathematicians to divide the quantity into fractions. Since the concepts of multiplication and division are so tightly connected, the question that follows must be asked: where does division come from?

For the most part, many people think of division and multiplication as just the same - these two concepts are clearly very similar. However, in many different situations, the two concepts are used to express different things. For example, in arithmetic problems, we often add two numbers together and divide the results by the number they were multiplied by - this makes sense because multiplication is adding two quantities together! However, in the mathematical world, division is not something that simply adds two numbers together: it is much more complex and involves dividing into fractions. This is because it involves a change in the mathematical objects - the quantities involved in multiplication. So why does this change occur? What happens when a quantity is divided?

To understand this, let us again imagine that we're adding two numbers together:

This means that each quantity is multiplied by the quantity it is multiplied by - this is why multiplication involves a change in objects! However, once we divide the two quantities into fractions, each quantity is left alone - and that is why the change in objects occurred! Now when we divide two quantities into fractions, we do not always do this in the same order! For example, if we divide 50 times 100 by 100, the quantity that is left alone is - and that's why this is called subtraction! Since subtraction involves a change of mathematical objects, what does this mean for kids? Why is it important to kids to understand subtraction?

Subtraction, or the concept of subtracting, is often used in elementary school and middle school. Children learn about the concept of subtracting when they use problems involving subtracting. Kids also learn about subtraction when solving problems with other mathematical concepts, such as multiplication and division. It is the difference between multiplying by 100 and dividing by 100 - that's how subtraction is important for kids.

In other words, while these two concepts are not always the same, they are often used in the same context, even though they may appear a little different to us. Let's take a closer look at how we use subtraction in several practical situations:

How subtraction is important for children in school and home

Subtraction is also important for learning in elementary school and middle school. In the classroom, children learn about this concept when solving problems with basic arithmetic. For example, they will solve problems like solving a 3x3 maze by solving a subtraction equation! In this lesson, we will look at some of the ways that subtraction works in addition to looking at an application of subtraction to math equations.

How the concept of subtraction is important in real life

Subtraction and division are also important for understanding concepts in the real world! For example, in addition, subtraction is used to divide amounts. So in real life, we divide an amount into multiple amounts and then we add the multiple amounts together in order to arrive at a final amount! This is a very common concept in everyday life!

For example, for the following picture:

You have two equal quantities: 6 and 100 - so you divide each quantity into multiple equal quantities: 10, 5, 4, 2, and 1. Now you add the multiple amounts together in order to arrive at a final amount: 100! So when you look at the picture, you see that 100 is equal to both 6 and 100 - this is what you called subtraction!

What does subtraction do in real life?

The subtraction concept is useful in everyday life because it helps us understand the concept of addition. In addition

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what the NTI stands for, let's use an example from the field of psychology! We know that many people who are naturally inclined to mathematics have also been found to have a high ability to solve other problems. One important psychological theory says that when people are mentally more focused on a problem, it tends to occur more quickly and with better results than when we are not so deeply engaged in a given thought process. The basic premise behind this theory is that if we are constantly thinking about a particular idea, the information that we are processing is much more focused on that thought process than if we are just playing with the same concept multiple times in a row! So if you have been taking a lot of math classes, it's natural that you would have noticed that you tend to solve problems quicker and better, even if it's still not 100% clear at the end of the day - right?!

In math it is important to keep in mind that thinking about a problem, or taking a math class, does not mean that we just know how to solve problems. Even if we know a lot of math, we still cannot do things like write an algorithm on paper and pass it on to someone! It's important to understand that we aren't the only people in the world with this ability to figure out the meaning of mathematical terms. Other people are also able to do so, but are less inclined to try this, and only a few people are able to think and solve problems as clearly as we are able to.

There are some other reasons why people are likely to have a higher IQ than average. In particular, many people claim that they are born with a special ability that has helped them learn and understand mathematics easier than most others! What makes this claim so accurate is the fact that we have a lot more experience with mathematical terms and concepts than most other humans! One of the most prominent examples of this is that children with autism show more mathematical ability than children who are typically developing, despite being in the same age group. Even when adults are taught math concepts as children (such as multiplication, division, geometry, astronomy, physics, algebra, and statistics), many people tend to be slower and less focused than their child counterparts!

Unfortunately there are some other people that are very likely to have low IQ. For example, we know that there are some people who have a lower IQ than average due to several possible factors that affect our ability to learn mathematics in general. For example, children who are extremely physically challenged tend to have lower IQs (the difference between their IQ and their average IQ) than children who are relatively unaffected by their physical disabilities (the difference between their IQ and their average IQ)! There are some people, however, who have a lower IQ than the average due to a lack of focus and motivation - people who are constantly on their toes trying to figure out how to solve a math problem! And finally, there's also a lot of people who simply cannot learn or understand math. These people can learn about math, but they will not be able to make use of what they have learned effectively. For these individuals, mathematics would seem like a waste of time, and they will not be able to understand what they have learned at all!

Some people claim that the reason why some people have higher IQs than others is because their natural tendency is that they are easier to control during math classes, but not at all during other times! And what this means is that if we are forced to play with math for an extended period of time, we may very well not be able to think and solve problems as well as we would like to! However, this can happen due to many different reasons, some of which are explained in more detail in the following chapters...

Chapter Thirty Seven
Intuition and Mathematics in the Bible

Remember what we learned last chapter? It was apparent from the first two chapters that we will be playing a major role in determining the results of our lives in the future. And as I mentioned, this is why we need a lot of math skills! But besides being able to solve math problems, we also need to be able to understand what mathematical terms mean and how to apply those mathematical terms effectively and quickly. To do this, we need a lot of logic, which we can naturally draw from the Bible, as it tells us a lot about the idea of mathematics. To understand what the Bible says about mathematical terms in more detail, consider the following passages:

Ephesians 2:8-9

But you yourselves ought, not as ignorant as some, but as having the light of God, that you may have mercy on those who are without mercy. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. … And if one believes in Him, he will not perish but have eternal life. For God has loved us and sent his Son in our name to show us that love is not an unreasonable commandment but a command that should be observed for the sake of those who have come to God through him. 

This passage makes quite a compelling argument that if we can love the world so much God would give his only Son in order to rescue

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what mathematicians do, the following are some of the things that a mathematician does:

If we're going to solve the problem, we need to have an idea of what the solution may look like.
When we have an idea of what a solution is going to look like, it is much easier to come up with a solution.
Once we have come up with a solution, we are able to start building up our algorithm and thinking about the next steps in the problem.

As a mathematician, it's not unusual for me to spend some of my time thinking about the way in which the concept of "number" was used in the history of mathematics. For example, one of the most notable mathematicians of the 20th century is the French mathematician Henri Poincaré. In his book "Causes and Propositions," he goes on to discuss some of the basic concepts of numbers, including the concept of infinitesimals (small fractions of the whole), the concept of natural numbers (numbers which can represent anything that can be thought of as a natural number) and the concept of integers.

To better understand Poincaré's reasoning, let's look at a famous example - the triangle inequality! This inequality states that:
$$
AB\lt ACB\lt ABA.
$$
In the above example, we've established a triangle inequality for all triples of numbers - namely AB, ACB, ABA. In other words, AB, ACB, and ABA are all numbers from the range [0, 1]. Now the above triangle inequality can be re-written as:
$$
AB\lt ACB\lt ABA\lt ACB\lt ABA\lt ACB
$$
Where, of course, the term ABA represents the quantity we are interested in! It's important to note that the quantity we want to represent in this expression (A), is actually the number of sides in the triangle! If, for example, we want to represent the quantity A equal to 3, we would say, $A=3$!

For more math related examples, check out the links below!

A:

The first thing to note is that the mathematics of the past, particularly in ancient times, never required humans to develop a sense of spatial orientation. Instead they were just required to understand the rules of composition and arithmetic. This is why you would find the first modern mathematical problem (called the equation of triangle in ancient times) to be so simple and seemingly trivial.
The equation of triangle is a very powerful mathematical equation because it allows us to easily determine all of the three sides of a triangle. When calculating the three sides of a triangle, we do not need to do any calculations. As an illustration of how simple the solution of the equation of triangle is, below is the equation of a triangle where one side has a length of $2,$ the second side has a length of $12,$ and the third side has a length of $10$:
$$\sum_{a \in \{0,2,12,10\}^3} (a-\frac{1}{2}) = 2$$
Next, below is the equation of a triangle where one side has a length of $4$ and the second side has a length of $8,$ and the third side has a length of $12,$ which can be solved using a similar procedure to the example above, but using $12$ instead of $2$:
$$\sum_{a \in \{0,4,8\}^3} (a-\frac{1}{2}) = 4$$
Finally, below is the equation of a triangle where one side has a length of $5$ and the second side has a length of $8,$ and the third side has a length of $10.$ This can be easily solved using the example above:
$$\sum_{a \in \{0,5,8\}^3} (a-\frac{1}{2}) = 8$$
Let's look at the above four equations and note that they allow us to calculate all of the three sides of a triangle. As an example of how important it is to have the right side of the equation (the side with a length of $2$) we can look at the above four equations and note that in order to determine the height of the triangle, we must know the length of the side with a length of $4$. The equation of triangle allows us to calculate all three sides of a triangle in this simple manner.

As I discussed before in my post on the concept of infinitesimals, there are a number of examples that demonstrate how simple equations can be. For instance, for any set of numbers $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, there are infinitely many different sets of numbers that are in the same set and thus can be added to the set to make up a new set of numbers. Since there are infinitely many different sets of numbers, it follows that we can always add more and more numbers to make up a set of numbers. In other words, all of the numbers can be added to the number $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}^6$ to make up an infinite set of numbers. This infinite

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict a person's cognitive functioning, many times the person is categorized into either a high or low functioning group. However, scientists have found that a person's cognitive functioning does not only depend on whether they are classified as a "high" or "low" function group; they also appear to be highly correlated with the way they think. In particular, people with a "high" functioning style of thinking are less likely to have mental illnesses than those with a "low" functioning style of thinking. And the same can be said about the intelligence quotient, measured by a standardized test of mental abilities. The reason is that people with a high functioning style of thinking are more likely to be creative, imaginative, problem-solvers, and have good analytical/comprehension skills. The same cannot be said for people with a "low" functioning style of thinking, who are more likely to have emotional problems and are more likely to be easily emotionally stressed. However, people with a high functioning style of thinking and good analytical/comprehension skills often also tend to have high self-esteem and are more likely to have an optimistic outlook on life. These are key traits in people who are "fully energized" by their lives - those who are content with the lives they lead. So how can a person with good analytical/comprehension skills and high self esteem perform better on standardized tests and, therefore, be more likely to live a happier and healthier life?

To answer this question, let's look at a few examples of how people with high functioning thinking styles tend to think - the way they think affects how they think. Let's take a look at how the term "idea" actually comes from - it means thinking about something. For example, someone with a "high" functioning style of thinking is likely to try to think about all possible ways in which a problem can be solved using science-based research. For example, someone with a "high" functioning style of thinking might try to solve this problem by finding a way to make things that don't exist naturally by adding new materials and new processes. This, in turn, can lead to new products that can be used for many different purposes.

Similarly, another example can be found in mathematics. Math is used in solving problems and mathematical logic is a type of thought that is used for creating problems and developing solutions to problems. The way mathematics is used and the ideas used to solve problems can strongly affect the way that mathematical solutions are constructed. The way people think about mathematical problems (ie. using mathematical logic) can strongly affect how they create mathematical solutions to problems.

So when asked to solve a problem and then explain how that solution came about, a person who has a "high" functioning style of thinking can often use mathematics to try to explain this solution to themselves, while someone who has a "low" functioning style of thinking tends to go through the motions of thinking about the problem and come up with a solution that doesn't fit the problem they are trying to solve.

The same thing can be said when it comes to solving a problem and developing a solution. A person who has a "high" functioning style of thinking can often find and apply mathematical ideas to solve problems, while someone who has a "low" functioning style of thinking usually comes up with the solution at the very last moment.

To answer a question, the best way to understand a person's cognitive functioning style is to look at a question that's already been posed, and see how the answer is coming from his or her own thinking style. This process can be done using a standardized test in order to quickly determine which style of thinking is most common for someone. For example, let's take a look at the problem from the SAT Verbal Reasoning test - the idea test.
The question asked is: "What are the three parts of an automobile?"
This example shows how a person who has a "high" functioning thinking style can understand the idea of the idea of an automobile. For example, in this problem, we see that there are three parts to an automobile - the engine, the wheels, and the frame. Let's also take a look at how a person who has a "high" functioning thinking style can understand the ideas related to the engine, wheels, and frame - this information can then be used to understand what it means to "car" an automobile - it means having three different types of parts within the automobile to make it move.

The SAT Verbal Reasoning test was developed to measure student's ability to reason mathematically - to use mathematics for solving problems. It takes about half an hour to complete, and the test contains three different ideas that are related to various parts of the automobile - the engine, the wheels, and the frame. The questions are organized into seven different categories. Here are a few examples:

Parts Of A Car: What Are These Parts of an Automobile?
Car - Parts That Make It Move: Do These Different Parts Really Make a Car Move?
Engine - How Does a Car Engine Work?
Rims - How Does a Car Wheel Work?
Framing - How Do Parts of a Car Fit Together?
Front Doors - How Does a Car Frame Fit Together?
Back Doors - How Does a Car

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of a mathematician's mind, let's take a look at this funky diagram that shows what exactly happens when an arithmetic equation is "completed" - the math being the set of rules by which we solve problems!

The above graph demonstrates a very complex piece of math - each piece of mathematical content is represented by a node in this graph. The most interesting part of this graph is the two nodes representing the sum and the product - those nodes have been linked together because we know that when we add an integer to a number, we add a negative integer - we add the negative of the number we were given in order to represent our answer correctly! This is what is known as division. Likewise, when we multiply two numbers, we add the negative of each number and combine these negative integers to represent our final answer. This is what is known as multiplication. So math is basically the study of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing - it is all based on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division...

But what happens to these nodes when we complete the equation? Well when we find the last negative sign on the sum, we know we are able to correctly represent the positive value, since we can then subtract the value we just found to get the negative of that positive value. Similarly, when we find the last negative sign on the product, we know we are able to correctly represent the negative value, since we can then multiply the negative value by the positive value to get our answer. And so, we know how to represent the correct answer, and we know how to calculate the value correctly by adding and subtracting correctly!

So now we can use our understanding of what we have learned to explain how we can use mathematics to solve math equations. For example, in order to calculate how long something took to travel from A to B, we can just add up the number of steps we took to travel from A to B from each step we took to get there - we will get a number that is equal to the time we took to travel from A to B. Using our understanding of how mathematics works, we can then represent this value by the following equation:
$$
t = x+y$$
where x = how long the time took to travel from A to B; y = how long we took to travel from A to B.

This equation can now be solved using the following algorithm - which is essentially adding together the negative integers that are representing the negative values of both sides of the equation and dividing by the positive values.

Since all math is based on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, this makes sense! If there is a difference between how many steps we took from A to B on one side of the equation and how many we took to travel from A to B on the other side, then this is a mathematical problem. By solving this problem, we can then understand the relationship between these numbers. And this understanding will lead us directly into learning more!

Of course, this isn't the only type of mathematics you can use for solving math problems! There are also equations of third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh derivatives (in mathematics, derivatives are used to describe or measure the behavior of a particular quantity over a particular time period, usually referred to as a trajectory or curve) - you can easily write the following equations using your knowledge of the math formulas!

The importance of mathematics to solving life's real-life problems can be seen in the fact that we don't usually see a problem when trying to write down a mathematical formula or solve an algebraic equation. We don't usually see problems like this until we encounter a problem where our mathematical understanding isn't working properly. So if you find yourself trying to make a problem more mathematically rigorous by making the variables, their names, and their meanings more detailed, you may be surprised at how much help you will get! This is what I teach all my kids when I talk about solving mathematical problems on the internet! The math and facts that I teach them are directly related to life and the problems they face when solving everyday problems!

Of course, there are also other subjects that are related to mathematics, but they are much less familiar to most students. Let's take a look at some of the topics that I think are best explained in a way that's more engaging!

Chapter Thirty Seven
ISTJ Social and Personality Themes Mathematics

What are the different ways in which people think? Most people tend to think in one of two different ways:

As a person - in this case, we can think as a person and think of things that are part of our reality - things like people, food, and flowers. In this case, it would be helpful for us to think about our own feelings (how do they feel, what is going on in their minds, etc). For example, imagine you were an orphan and could not think clearly at the time. You would probably think like this:

I am an orphan - I'm alone in the world, so nobody will talk to me... I'm lonely - I am sad, so nobody will smile to me... I'm sad - I'm lonely, so nobody will talk to me... I'm sad - I am lonely, so nobody will talk to me...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how complex cognitive functions such as mathematics and literacy can be represented in terms of other human skills, it helps to have a quick and simple mental model in mind. This helps you think about how these complex skills are related to other human skills in a more logical and well-organized way. In this chapter, we'll explore some examples of these two important human skills.

There are a few different ways that we may think of mathematical skills as being related to literacy skills - one way is that mathematics might be more involved and complex. For example, a person with a learning disability might be able to recognize and manipulate the basic symbols and structures used by writers, poets, mathematicians, and scientists, but not the symbols and structures used by computer programs, programmers, and scientists. A person with high intelligence and strong memory may also be able to understand the concepts used in math, but not the concepts used in computer programs. The opposite of the above scenario is that a person with poor memory, poor literacy, and poor mathematical skills might be able to understand the concepts used in math, but be unable to remember and remember them.
If we consider all of these four types of learning disabilities simultaneously, we would conclude that the ability to think mathematically depends on the ability to remember math. Math can therefore be considered a sort of abstraction, where the concept of "math" can be translated into a symbol or symbol family that is easier to remember. However, math concepts are not all that hard to remember - they are just very complex!

A similar example comes from literacy. In particular, it's interesting to note that literacy is very closely related to mathematics. Literacy is related to not only the ability to read and write but also the ability to correctly and efficiently solve math problems! In other words, the better you write and read, the better you know how to solve math problems. Of course, this might sound contradictory, but it doesn't! Literacy is related to mathematics because it depends on the ability to comprehend math problems in the form of words and phrases! To be able to understand math concepts you need to have already seen them and heard them before, which means that you will need to be able to remember or read words and phrases before you can understand what you are reading! This means that literacy also depends on our ability to remember mathematical concepts in the form of words and phrases!

So for simplicity's sake, we'll assume that all of us are writing our mathematics lessons in the present tense, with each concept written using one or more of the eight basic symbols listed above.

Now let's consider a simpler example. Let's pretend you're trying to learn a new way of writing a story - we'll refer to this as "Talking Stories". Talking stories use language (written and spoken) to describe how things work and how events unfold, rather than using plain English. We need to be able to learn and use these language structures, so let's write some Talking Stories for ourselves! To learn, you first need to listen to stories about Talking Stories; this will help you know what to write if you want to follow these stories properly.

Another way to understand what Talking Stories mean is to think about how different languages are written. If you want to write a new language, you first need to understand its grammar - the rules that govern how a language is written. Talking stories are written in Talking Stories that are written in this same grammar, but the words and phrases are different! So if you want to learn Talking Stories, you need to understand this grammar and then translate your Talking Stories into it.

Now let's consider some examples of Talking Stories in this section. We can use Talking Stories to help us remember some concepts used in literacy as well, such as proper punctuation and sentence structure. Let's take a look at how Talking Stories can help us remember the concept of proper punctuation.

First, let's remember that punctuation can be understood as a symbol, such as a comma (" and ") or a dash ("-") used to separate sentences. For example, we can use Talking Stories to remember that we need a comma in our Talking Stories to follow stories with proper punctuation, such as Talking Story Three where we need to follow the story "Peter the Cat has two rabbits" with "Peter" and the correct punctuation in Talking Story Four, where we need to follow the story "Peter the Cat has three rabbits" with "Peter" and the proper punctuation in Talking Story Five, where we need to follow the story "Peter the Cat has ten rabbits" with "Peter" and the proper punctuation in Talking Story Six, where we need to follow the story "Susan has a cat named Charlie" with "Susan" and the correct punctuation in Talking Story Seven, where we need to follow the story "Charlie's cat, Charlie's rabbit, and Charlie's spider" with Charlie and the correct punctuation in Talking Story Eight, where we follow "Charlie's cat" and the correct punctuation in Talking Story Nine, where we follow "Charlie's rabbit" and the correct punctuation in Talking Story Ten, where we follow "Charlie's spider

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the journey to Ascension will involve us leaving the group and travelling alone. In my previous chapter, I described the changes that occur when someone leaves the group to go on their own. One important change occurs when someone leaves the group - they leave not only the group but their friends as well. This leaves the group with a very limited number of people they can interact with in this new world. So even though we won't see any other 3+1 dimensional people, there is still a great deal of group interaction left and we will have to learn a lot about that in order to succeed!

And as the previous chapter suggested, the last thing to consider is the decision of whether to leave the group. You will never know if you will ever be invited back to a group, and as such, it's important to take your time and decide how you feel about leaving the group. If you decide to leave, remember you can come back anytime, but if you decide to stay, don't forget to keep your team with you because that will definitely give you a major advantage over other players!

Now let's take a closer look at the reasons why people are leaving the group. If you're one of those characters that would rather leave the group, we will talk more about it in the next chapter! 

A:

There is a big difference between leaving the group and being invited to a group. 
Leave the group
Your first reaction should be the feeling of utter defeat that you've had because you thought you knew everything and your team was going to be useless in an encounter. It's not the group you have formed now. No doubt it won't work anymore, and the group that works will also no longer be the group you formed.
Even though there's still a group with you, you'll feel completely useless since you won't be able to share any of the resources you need, or the opportunities that will be available for you to work together. You might also still be able to make your team work for the other characters but it won't be at the same level. The only real difference will be the feeling of having gone a few steps down the group, instead of just being a member of it.
The group may not survive
This is the last option that you have. Your team may still exist but it may be gone completely. If you have a few allies that you know will not be there, you can leave them to the other characters, but if there are more you have to fight alone.
If you really want to leave the group, you have to figure out how to do that, or you risk giving up all the opportunities that you've been given. You have to learn to work together to make everything possible for you.
There is more to be said
If you're really scared of losing your group, it might make you think that leaving the group is the only option. However, the chances are that your team will still survive. The only thing that may have changed is that it will still have less resources and you'll have to work harder. But it won't be easy. After all, your team will be made up of other characters, which is why their abilities will be the same. The fact that the team has to go out and work and live their lives is what makes it so difficult.
It's also important that you're not too afraid of being left alone. Being alone in a group can be hard, but it doesn't have to be. It is perfectly normal to be upset and feel empty if you feel alone for a long time. It doesn't mean that you have to leave the group, though.

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the concept of mental maps and MBTI tests is fairly simple and straightforward. Let us take a look at one of the simplest of these: the concept of mental maps.

An important concept to understand in a MBTI test is the concept of mental maps. In other words, it is your mind's representation of yourself, your potential strengths, and limitations.

When you take a mental map, your mind does not create its own unique mental representation of yourself. Instead, your mind creates a mental map - a two-dimensional representation of yourself and yourself's potential strengths, and limitations. Your potential strengths and limitations are the lines on your map - like the widths of the lines on a graph are based on the numbers in your head! Just like you can take a slice through a graph to obtain your 3D projection of your body, you can take a slice through a mental map and obtain your 2D projection. Your mental map is created from your past experiences, relationships, your goals, and ambitions. So your mental map may be very narrow and simple, but if you are willing to work at it, it can change over time.

You can also take a mental map of yourself at a time of day - for example, at breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The more of a day your mind "knows", the wider, more detailed, and more interesting your mental map will be. So for example, imagine that you are taking a mental map of your self at lunchtime. You are sitting in your kitchen eating lunch. Then suddenly you hear someone approaching from behind, and your mind immediately thinks "that's probably my boss!"...which is probably correct! Unfortunately your mind creates two very different mental maps - one that gives you a very high confidence rating of the person, and one that gives you a very low confidence rating of the person.

Let's now take a look at another example. You are taking a mental map of yourself at dinner time. You are cooking dinner. Then suddenly someone approaches from behind and is shouting in your ear, "Whoa! Did you eat lunch?"...you immediately think "that's probably my boss, I'm so late for work!" - you have no idea where the person was until you realize that he was talking to you in the kitchen - and then you quickly think "that's probably my boss, I'm so late for work!"

So the point is this: your mind has a very short and limited memory. But this is not to say that your mind is not "refreshed" at all - when it goes back to your past experience, the more "refreshed" it is in memory. And when you "walk into" an unfamiliar environment like your kitchen, it becomes easier to recall your past experience, and to create a more detailed and "accurate" representation of it. You can always take new experiences, relationships, relationships, goals, and ambitions and create new mental maps in the future! All this is completely up to your own abilities, and in the end the more creative you are, the better you can create new mental maps.

So how does it make sense to use an MBTI test to measure your cognitive abilities? Well this is exactly what an MBTI test does. You are taking a mental map, and your mind creates a new mental map from your past experiences, relationships, goals, and ambitions. This process is very slow and repetitive. When your mind knows it can't "create" anything more than what it already has in memory, the brain begins to start to "rewrite" or "switch" over to other representations of things in order to get "accurate" information about a situation. For example, when you go to a new restaurant, your mind creates a new mental map of what you hope to find on your plate. Then the brain will "rewrite" the picture on your plate, and start thinking about what you can find there. Eventually, the process goes back to "recreating" a memory, and the brain can look at your mental map and think, "that's where I am looking for a certain food".

As our brains adapt, we do this with more and more information. And each time a situation is presented, the process of "redrawing new" mental maps can be much more "accurate" and complete! This process keeps our brain constantly working and "redrawing" new mental maps that correspond to our new reality!

Of course, this doesn't mean that an MBTI test is 100% accurate! However, it has a relatively good overall accuracy of about 60%. This is because the people taking the test are people who are very familiar with themselves - for example, someone who has read the book "Your Inner Strengths" that provides a detailed description of their personalities. So while it is possible for you to have a very specific mental map about yourself, and then you get asked a question about a situation that is very unusual for you, your chances of getting an accurate answer will be greatly reduced. So even though this may seem somewhat like a disadvantage, it actually works in conjunction with the fact that your mind's ability to "build" new mental maps is extremely limited.
In summary, if you are planning a future career in management, you should take an

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the reality of marriage on Baker Street, here are some interesting facts about that institution:

Every Wednesday there is an Open House on Baker Street. At this event, the public is able to look at real estate on the street and meet with the local agents and property owners who might be interested in what they are selling. On this particular Wednesday, May 3rd, a house with a four-bedroom and two bathrooms had just been listed for $10,000! The listing was placed on eBay the same day and sold for $28,000 on the same day - a record time period!
On May 1st, 2012, there were some 60 agents in the market for a home with four bedrooms and two bathrooms. These agents were only allowed to sell one property at a time. The list price was $19,000. The agent could no longer sell her home because her house sold quickly, so she went to a friend who was just about to get a buyer to get her home for $4,000.
It is amazing how quick sellers can make a sale even though they don't have a contract...it happened to me! It was only after one year that I sold my first home. But when I was just about to move in to this new house, a big issue arose. So, I called all my vendors and asked them how much they were going to charge me. And so it was like an auction...I was the only one out of all the vendors out there. The only thing I was asking for was the amount of time for my vendor to find the best seller in my price range. And for a vendor to not be the fastest in the auction, they had to be the only one out of all the vendors in the price range I was asking for. And so, the first place that they came into the auction that had a listing price of $14,000 was the only one with the selling price of $28,000. So, if anyone wanted to sell their house, they could!
On Monday, May 18th, 2012, there were many open houses taking place in and around Central Park on Saturday and Sunday. But the ones that took place on the Saturday and Sunday were on Baker Street. These were the open houses that had taken place on the Saturday and Sunday for a week. And then the last opening that had taken place on the day was on the Saturday night...the same opening that on the Sunday morning had been closed out. The buyers had a chance to visit these houses. And as the closing took place, I could see several big buyers coming inside of their houses. And it was like a party - there were plenty of people enjoying themselves while buying a house. There was also a lot of excitement as they entered their doors. The buyers had been waiting for this time to come...and it finally came. I felt like I had been buying this house for three years. For me, this was the first time I saw my home being sold! It was great to finally find a house. There are some things that people often forget in their searches...the closing is important. And so, I was able to see so many of the buyers coming into the house, looking at the details of the home, getting excited about the house, and telling each other about the new owner. I knew this was going to be an awesome day! And so, I ended up buying this house for $29,000. I couldn't have been more excited! And so, it is amazing that I bought this house for that much! Because, I really thought this would be like $16,000. But then, I saw a person walk in. She looked at the house and said, 'Oh yes...this is great. I love it.' So, I went to the person to ask what her offer was. But the person said, 'That's too good for me!' So, the person went off and walked away with the owner. And I was in the mood to sell the house. So, I just drove to the bank, I signed up for the listing, and I closed the house in a big hurry. And at the closing, I just got $14,000. And so, I

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict how these beliefs are related to mathematics, we can refer back to a few previous chapters. While it is easy to take one of the following movies and just "just see how" to relate the story, here we will make a few points about the specific beliefs that are central to our story - which are very important to understanding these beliefs! At this point in our story, we will be using Maya language (a subset of Native American language).

The First Thing to Note is that Maya believe in three things that are very important in all of our day-to-day lives: numbers, numbers, and numbers! As such, in this section we will try to explain how they explain math and what we will be using to relate this math to Maya...a.r.t. Maya...b.c.a.d.

Number One

As we have discussed in our first and second movie, it is interesting to note that even though Maya are the largest people in existence (they have over 20 million people around the world!), their language is quite simple! And speaking about simple language, they believe that every language is derived from a simple base, or alphabet. So when we think of Maya, we think of how they made their languages. The languages themselves are called K'iche', a term which literally means "simple" and was originally created to describe Maya language!

Number Two

One of the reasons why we are fascinated about the Maya language is that even though they were once thought to be completely unknown to us, their language is based on simple rules. While it would be completely absurd to think that simple language could exist in so much detail and detail! This is why it is important to understand how these rules were written down...to better understand them you will need to watch our first movie.

Number Three

Another interesting thing about the Maya language is that they believe that numbers and letters are the same thing! That is, Maya believe that "letters" (or numbers) are just symbols representing numbers. And the letters that are used to represent numbers are called K'iche'! Just as numbers are created from simple symbols, the names of letters are created from simple symbols. So when we think of "letters" in Maya language, we think of their origins. For example, when we think of a person and their name, we think of their birth date!

These are just a few of the things that Maya believe. So what does this mean for our understanding of mathematics? Well, let me break it down a little bit:

Number One: In this first section, we will take a look at Maya language and what it means to believe in 3 things.

Number Two: We will discuss how the Maya language is derived from their belief that the letters are just symbols representing numbers.

Number Three: We will discuss the basis for Maya belief that numbers and letters are the same thing.

Number Two: It's easy to take a movie and just "just see how" to apply Maya language to math. However, we will begin by examining some basic Maya beliefs before we continue.

Number Three: Now let's take a look at basic Maya beliefs that will help us understand some of the mathematics that we will be working with...a.r.t. Maya...b.c.a.d. Let's start with a few basics! This is very important - we need to keep things simple so that our understanding of our story is as fluid and complete as possible. To do this, we will be exploring some of the basics Maya believe in.

Number One: The first thing to note about numbers is that they are used to create words. The Maya believe that "language" is actually the number of words or phrases in a given language. In other words, you can only have one word for every number! So in Maya, it is not possible to have a one word number! Instead, you have to have a phrase...a sentence for each number!

Number Two: In this first section of the movie, we will take a look at how Maya believe that the K'iche' are the numbers that create the words/phrases. The Maya consider the K'iche' to be the numbers that create their phrases! Therefore, when we think of Maya,

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the reality of time, Einstein developed the concept of the wave of simultaneity. This wave represents all the time-related information that each of our four senses can detect at any given moment. At the moment you are reading this chapter, this wave is just as long as your breath takes you to breathe.
One way to understand how the wave works is to imagine a ship that is sailing through a time vortex. There is a time-varying speed along the ship's path. For example, at the moment you are reading this chapter, the ship is at the speed of light! In fact, it's the speed of light that creates the time vortex in your brain. Every time you wake up, you'll remember how fast you were last at that moment. Of course, it won't be the case that you were just at that point of time, but it's a way to represent the amount of time your brain would take you to remember a specific moment. This is the speed at which a ship would travel if it was at rest in the infinite ocean of simultaneity, where all time-related information is contained within the same wave.

To find a way to "walk" through the time vortex that surrounds us, Einstein invented the concept of a time dilation device - a device that takes us backward in time. When you activate your time dilation device, it "opens up" our experience and tells us how long it would take us to remember what we were experiencing at the moment. This concept of time dilation is similar to what happens during slow motion pictures. A slow motion picture is a movie that does not move at all. During slow motion, we can still see the faces of our characters or hear the voices of our actors.

It's interesting to note that some people will be attracted to the idea of time dilation - this is probably because they experience a certain sort of sensory enjoyment when trying to remember things long ago. Of course, this doesn't mean that time dilation is a "thing" - it's just a way of describing how the brain sees and recognizes time-related information. However, it is one of the ways our brains process information about time, and it can often be a valuable tool in learning how to better "handle" the information we receive about time, and what it means to live in a time vortex.

As an aside, it's interesting to note that one of the most amazing things about the brain is the plasticity that it exhibits. As previously mentioned, there is a constant flow of neurons that enter, leave, and fuse with new neurons throughout our brains. Every time we experience a sudden moment in time and time-related information is changed, the same process occurs. As a result, whenever we think about time, our brains remember how long it would take for us to remember a specific event, which is just as accurate as the truth!

We also know that the brain naturally adjusts itself to constant changes in stimuli. For example, if you were to push a button and the button did not vibrate at all, then it would feel different than it would when you were trying to remember how long you had been doing that buttonpress.

Another way to explain the fact that we remember events that happened before is to note that the brain's nervous system is continually trying to correct errors, which is known as neurogenesis. As we grow older, our brains naturally generate more neurons, which also makes sense as we age, as the brain becomes less able to learn new information. This means that as our brains age, they become more accurate in remembering things.

Of course, there are other things that occur in our brains that help us process the information we receive about time. For instance, the amygdala is thought to be a "neurological watchdog", which means it processes and stores a lot of information about past, present, and future events. When we experience an emotional stimulus, the amygdala responds in much the same way as the human brain does when we remember something. A few years ago, a new study reported that the emotional stimuli in question were actually stored in the brain as amygdala-like cells rather than being present at specific locations.

What has been happening with time is an entirely different story - it's constantly shifting with

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the universe consists of only 4 dimensions - and there is no extra dimension! If you asked a 4D observer how to get around in this 4D world, he would respond that there is no way. Well, he is not completely wrong! It turns out that there is way! The only way to get around in this 4D world is by moving into a different dimension - a dimension that is higher than the original one that we're in at the moment. It is not possible to enter a lower-dimensional space in a higher-dimensional one - and that's why the existence of the extra dimension cannot be disproved!

Let's begin by focusing on the most well-known example of how a 4D observer could travel into a higher dimensional space: the concept of dimension shift. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light does not necessarily change - we always experience the speed of light relative to the vacuum itself. And because the speed of light is unalterable, moving into a new dimension is equivalent to moving into the vacuum. So if we're going to "enter" a higher-dimensional space, we simply need to move into a higher dimensional vacuum, and then turn back into a lower-dimensional space at the same point in time that we're doing it in!

Now, a great way to understand this concept is to think about how the speed of light changes as we "go up" into higher dimensional spacetime, and then think about how moving into a higher-dimensional vacuum feels. Obviously the speed of light would not change as we move through spacetime, but once we turn back into a lower-dimensional space, the speed of light at our new point in time would be greater than the speed of light at the original point in time! So this would be how we would experience moving into a higher-dimensional space! So even if there's no extra dimension in the universe, the concept of dimension shift is still an important one...

Now let's move on to the most controversial part of this whole theory: the origin of the extra dimension! Let's use the example of a 4D particle being thrown into a higher-dimensional spacetime. Let's imagine the 4D particle is a little ball that is suspended in space and is being thrown by an extremely powerful man with a golden rod to the side of his body and into a 4D vacuum. The man would obviously know exactly what direction to throw the ball in, since it is at such a high speed it's obvious that he'd already know it when he first launched it. Now imagine that the man starts throwing at the same time, and at the same angle and into the same 4D vacuum! Is this possible? Well, as far as the theory goes, yes! But not the way you might think! Suppose we were to try and explain the theory of dimension shift using ordinary physics - i.e., using what we know about the motions of objects and their behavior under different conditions! Would this actually explain why the man could control the direction and speed of the ball? Well, unfortunately, this is exactly what Einstein predicted in his theory of relativity - we cannot explain the behavior of objects in higher-dimensional spacetime using ordinary physics!

A great way to understand the concept of dimension shift using Einstein's theory of relativity is by considering the idea of a moving mass. Imagine our mass being thrown into space. Imagine a mass with a point mass at its center, and a point mass at the end of the rod. The mass at the end of the rod is moving so quickly that, even if the mass of the mass at the center stays constant, the speed of the mass at the end of the rod would be equal to the speed of light. Of course, if we have 4D spacetime instead of just 3+1 dimension, then things get quite interesting! Imagine a 4D particle, which moves in a 4D vacuum. And imagine the speed of light at the end of the rod being less than that of the center of mass of the mass at the end of the rod (which stays constant), just as we would in 3+1 dimension.

Finally, in order for us to explain what the 4D particles are doing in 4D spacetime, we'll have to make one more assumption. Let's assume that the "end of the rod" is the end of space! Which means that the mass in question does not move at all! Instead, we assume that the particle has a mass m near the center of the rod - and we assume that the mass of the particles is distributed all around the rod. Now let's imagine a 4D observer watching from inside a 5D space. Imagine a mass with a point mass at the center of the mass. And imagine that the mass of the mass near the center of mass of the 5D particle is moving at a constant speed in the 4D vacuum. And again, if we have 4D spacetime instead of just 3+1 dimension, things get quite interesting! Imagine our mass being thrown by an extremely powerful man with a golden rod to the side of his body and into a 5D vacuum. The man would obviously know exactly what direction to throw the mass in, since it is at such a high speed, his mind would already have made up a mental image and he would already be in the right

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the world as we know it has very little to offer the masses, let alone the elite. For the mass of society, reality feels much more like it is going to implode than any potential future is really worth fighting for!

Now, let's take a moment to explore how religion and drugs interact. Many think religion has a profound effect on our mental and spiritual world - and if you're like most Americans, religion is pretty much your only safe haven from reality's shitty ways. Many religions try to convince people of the existence of a god or a supreme being; the idea is that if there is one, he or she must be on the receiving end of what most Americans feel like is an existential existential crisis of sorts - you have to decide if god would actually exist, what his or her purpose would be, and if in fact, it is possible to live a life which transcends the confines of mortal reality.

If you believe in a god, you might be told that the universe was created and endowed with infinite resources by God (even though most believe that the universe is essentially empty, meaning the universe is essentially empty!) - and that you must try to make use of them for your own benefit - if you haven't already - or worse still, to help guide your own destiny!

However, just like the majority of Americans, most Christians believe that God is a benevolent being who made every atom in the universe equal (including most of us). He gives us life in all its glorious diversity, and then he passes the power of this life on to us, through Jesus Christ. He makes us aware of our personal limitations and imperfections, and reminds us of what we can accomplish through our own actions and actions of others.

Many religions try to help us understand what it means to be human - to not be immortal - but, as we all know, all life is a living mystery. If we only ever accept the existence of God, we cannot see the beauty and richness of being human.

But if you believe in some sort of power beyond the scope of human comprehension, then there is a possibility that you might be able to find solace - happiness - and peace in a world that is far from your own. The idea is that there is a higher power that exists outside of the physical universe that we cannot understand fully. God may be the answer to some of your prayers, and that is something for which millions of Americans continue to pray, whether or not they believe in God, because in order to understand the divine, we have to look beyond our own limitations.

So, if you believe that we are all created by the same creator, and that there exists a higher power who created us, then you will likely begin to experience a certain sense of peace, love, and happiness that most Americans seem to have forgotten about because of reality's harsh realities.

The problem with religion is that it often gives people a false sense of security; it provides a sense of security that, in reality, is a lie. When you think about the things that are necessary to live and breathe, your body and your mind - things that have the potential to kill you - most of us are already crippled from birth. It's a problem that few people are aware of, and most of us don't even realize that we are crippled from the beginning!

However, the solution to this problem is simple. There is no real alternative to drugs; they provide a sense of security that most people feel comfortable putting away. However, it is a problem that few people realize they are suffering from, and many people don't even know that they are suffering from it. Many of the drugs available are addictive - meaning their effects are more than temporary. So what do addictive drugs really do to our brains?

All of the drugs that most Americans regularly take cause addictive "chemical interactions" with our brain cells; this means that when our body takes too many of these drugs, our body starts to use them more than it should - and then our brains don't tell us when they are full. This causes us to overuse drugs, which in turn causes our brains to become more fragile and ultimately to lose their capacity to function properly - eventually turning us into drug addicts.

Addictive drugs can kill your brain when you take them too often - in order to understand what happens, let's consider an example! According to many studies, smoking cigarettes kills up to three million people a year - but if you only smoked for 30 seconds, you would likely not die. So what did they learn about this from studies? They learned that a normal smoker is already killed by the amount of cigarettes they smoke - most normal smoker dies by age 36!

Addictive drugs that cause our brains to be damaged, in fact, often cause our brains to become addictive themselves - these drugs are just like cigarettes to our brains, only for cigarettes we are already dead, but when we take addictive drugs, we cause them to become a regular habit, and to take even more drugs as a form of self-indulgence - creating addiction in both ourselves and our loved ones!

And in the end, there is absolutely no way to avoid the

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the world we live in, we must imagine an island called The Ark of the Covenant. This island was built in the middle of the ocean to shelter and protect the people of Onkelos. Unfortunately, all that was left of this Ark of the Covenant was a fragment of its original design, which was almost completely lost to time. As luck would have it, this is something that the people of Onkelos have come to admire for many millennia! To this day, they place special veneration upon this little fragment of their original design, called The Ark of the Covenant.

What if the Ark of the Covenant was not the only treasure that's been hidden away inside our universe for centuries? What if there's a whole other hidden treasure that is sitting on The Ark of the Covenant that has been going undiscovered by our humble human race? Are we prepared to put forth the effort to find this treasure and claim this world as our own?

For the purpose of this story, we will refer to The Ark of the Covenant simply as the Ark of the Covenant! In fact, the main character is quite literally called the Ark of the Covenant! As a result of this, we won't discuss much about this story's main characters! You can find out more about them in The Ark of the Covenant by Sarah J Maas.

In the beginning of The Ark of the Covenant, when The Ark of the Covenant was still being restored, there was an incident involving the Ark's owner, the man named Jonah. Jonah had taken the Ark from his wife and had placed it on The Ark of the Covenant. Unfortunately, Jonah decided to leave the Ark on the island without taking any further precautions. Unfortunately, he had not realized the effect this small fragment of a damaged and broken Ark would have on The Ark of the Covenant. The Ark of the Covenant would be left alone without any one able to protect it. The next thing that Jonah did, was to travel to the center of The Ark of the Covenant, calling upon the Great God and asking Him to return the Ark of the Covenant to where it was originally meant to be - the home of the people of Onkelos. After a few years passed, The Ark of the Covenant finally returned to its home!

Now we know that Jonah did have his problems. However, the problem wasn't really Jonah's fault - it's something about the entire process that led to what happened. Let us start with the problem Jonah had. Although he was able to protect his wife and the Ark of the Covenant, the moment The Ark of the Covenant left The Ark of the Covenant, it was left entirely alone. Now, every time it was brought back to its original place, it would return to the same place it had started from. This was caused by the fact that the Ark of the Covenant is made of a very special material called Or, which is naturally curable in air and is very hard to cut, break, and burn.

In addition to being an extremely valuable piece of The Ark of the Covenant, this extremely precious material causes The Ark of the Covenant to be extremely hard to crack. Thus, it is even harder for the Ark of the Covenant to be attacked and destroyed by The Great God and His armies of angels! This is why it has always been considered to be one of the most important treasures that ever existed in all of existence!

This is why the people of Onkelos are very protective of the Ark of the Covenant! They do this not only because of the wonderful gifts that the Ark of the Covenant offers them but also because of The Ark of the Covenant's ability to protect the people of Onkelos and keep them safe from the dangerous forces that threaten them daily. Thus, they have been able to survive and thrive for many generations in spite of many enemies and dangers...just as we would expect a family to do!...

We have now reached the climax of this story! Let's discuss it in more detail! One way of exploring the end of The Ark of the Covenant is to look at the way Jonah was able to survive! It's hard to believe that Jonah was able to leave The Ark of the Covenant without falling into an enormous cave that is just over

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the concept of functional programming, we will consider the following problem:

Suppose we have a method that takes as input a function, and then performs some action on its argument. If I am not mistaken, this method returns the result of the function as a result, rather than returning a specific value. Do you think this approach is the most efficient for writing functions in JavaScript?
If the answer to this is "yes", what is the problem that was caused by this method? Could someone please explain this concept clearly?

Well let's look at the following scenario. Suppose I am writing a class called Function. It has a method called Function2, which takes one argument and returns a result of that argument. Does this method seem like it would be the most efficient way of writing code? Sure, it could be. But does it seem like the simplest and the cleanest method?

If we consider a function as a type, the function function2() is actually the function we want to create. Instead of creating a function with two different methods and two different types of results, we can just pass in the function and it will do it's work.
So let's consider the following scenario:
Example 1:

Say we are writing a new function named Function3 which takes two arguments and returns the result of the argument. This is a pretty direct way of doing it - function3() creates a new function with two different methods, just like function2() does. Does this approach work better than the function2() in the above scenario?
As an aside, this question is not about programming style - it's about the correctness of this approach, which is fine.

We can also compare this code to the following one using JavaScript's operator overloading:

Example 2:

If the question is, is this the correct way to write this method? Well, I think so. This is because we have the following features that make this method more efficient:

Functions are easy to understand and implement (i.e. they are shorter, easier to type, easier to read, etc). This is because the function constructor is easy to understand and to create by reading its method signature. This means that it doesn't have to use the constructor parameters as a constructor signature, which is another way of saving memory.

We can easily test the method's behavior using an empty method - we do not have to create a test function to test the result of the function.

If I am not mistaken, this method is more efficient than the function2() in the above scenario?
If we look at the above code, we can see that we have changed the signature of the constructor of the function so that it doesn't depend on parameters. We have also removed the parameter to let the function to work with objects (in the case of the function2()).

So what if we consider a function's method signature as a type, what would happen if we wanted to perform operations on different types of functions? We know that there are different types of functions in JavaScript. Let's consider the following scenario:

Suppose we want to remove a parameter from the signature of a function. Would this be possible in JavaScript?

This would not be possible. It is simply impossible to remove one of the parameters from the function signature in JavaScript. We would need to define a different method signature which does not have the parameter.

Let's consider the following scenario:

Consider the case when we want to create a method with an empty signature. Would this be possible in JavaScript? I don't think so - it is impossible to create an empty method signature in JavaScript.

This is because JavaScript already uses a special built-in type called Function to perform these operations. This type uses a method called empty(), which is an empty method (i.e. it does not return a value). And the empty method does not exist in JavaScript.

Let's consider the following scenario:

Suppose we want to create a new method which does not return a value. Would this be possible in JavaScript?

This is not possible. The empty method will never be created. A new method with no parameters can always be created in JavaScript, so we cannot create an empty method by simply returning an empty method.

Let's consider the following scenario:

Suppose we want to create a method with parameters and return a result. Would this

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict how this story relates to our discussions on the other chapters, let us discuss it from the point of view of our 3+1 dimensional world. As we mentioned in Chapter Twenty-seven, the universe is an expanding universe. This means that matter in our space-time is being consumed by energy as it moves through it. Eventually, this energy reaches a certain maximum; the faster it is consumed, the more the expansion stops, and the closer we get to our own universe. This is known as the "breakout" from the 3+1 dimensional universe, and it's generally described by the term "big bang".
Now imagine, in the back of your mind, that you are the magician who used your skill to magically transform a piece of metal into a golden appleskin. The pieces you used to make the appleskin are called sticks, and they are made up of many different things depending on what it will be used for. For instance, a wood block can be turned into a pineapple, a bamboo block into a bamboo stick, and so on. Each of these different sticks will have different characteristics and properties, so you would also need different magical instruments to make these different sticks.

Now, imagine that you don't know which sticks you will need to transform different kinds of objects. So you decide to spend some time walking around your garden, or playing a game of chess. What you are going to find, however, is that you have a variety of different sorts of sticks, and you're not sure exactly what to use with which object, because all you have is what you can see! Instead, you will walk around looking at all the different kinds of sticks, trying to figure out which is the one you will need to transform a particular object!

Now imagine that you are walking around the garden after having spent your time searching for the right sticks. You are wondering what you should do next. Do you need to use only wood sticks? Or do you need to use only bamboo sticks? Or do you need to use both wood and bamboo sticks? Or is there some sort of magic stick that will magically transform your objects in a magical way?

While exploring your garden, you are walking around, trying to find the right sticks. You are not sure what to use with which object - you only have what you can see in front of you. You get up and walk over a large branch, but you don't see any sticks in this area. You take a look at your little brother, and he is playing the same game as you. You notice that the small wood blocks in the small wood sticks are all turning into small pineapples. As your brother plays the game, he is magically transforming his wooden sticks into pineapple blocks, and all of his other wooden sticks - which were just pineapples, and weren't really wooden at all - become bamboo sticks!

As you are walking around your garden, you notice that your little brother has also used the wooden sticks and the bamboo sticks that he had found to create a variety of different kinds of objects. So, you decide to spend your time learning how to transform these different objects, which you now know are really the objects that need to be turned into specific kinds of objects, because you now understand what these objects are made of! But as you study how to turn these different kinds of objects into various kinds of objects, your brother starts to start to play the same kind of game as you!

Now, if you didn't know anything about the 4D universe (dimension X), why would you think that if you went around your garden and looked at the various kinds of wooden sticks you had found, that you could all transform them into pineapple and bamboo? In fact, you don't have to have an infinite variety of wooden sticks to do this! You just need to use the right sort of sticks with which you can turn these objects into different objects. So you go about discovering the right kinds of sticks to use with different objects in your garden. And you do so in a very short time! You start using the right kinds of wooden sticks with which to transform various kinds of wooden sticks into pineapple and bamboo. As you do so, you discover that your wooden sticks are not the only thing

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the world that we experience in reality, we need to add some detail to our world model - we need more detail! This means that we need to go beyond our simple concept of black and white.
This is where science fiction comes in! Science fiction is an incredibly useful source for the imagination - imagine living in a world where everything is so realistic that it becomes almost impossible for us to think outside of it! In fact, science fiction is one of the greatest sources for new ideas and concepts, since we don't always know exactly what is really going on until it's too late!
As the name suggests, science fiction is based on our real world - it is set in a world with other people and objects. However, in science fiction we don't really experience these things in the real world - rather we imagine the objects and people in the story to be the same as we are. Because science fiction is so well realized, it has often inspired and inspired other writers to create their own science fiction stories, sometimes with a whole world of their own!

At its core, science fiction is just an incredibly detailed world description - a world where we imagine a completely different world is going on. So how do we create this world? Well, there are three main strategies that science fiction writers use in order to make their world look realistic. The first is to follow a classic formula (as well as the second); this is usually referred to as the "tradeoff" technique. In this technique, the main character is forced to make some sort of choice or compromise in order to find out more about the environment around them. This choice or compromise typically involves some sort of tradeoff between their individual freedoms and the demands made by the larger society.

As you can imagine, this is an incredibly difficult concept to explain to the average person - however, it's a concept used in very many of today's books, movies, and games. In some sense, this is why we have such a huge fan base for science fiction - it provides us with so many amazing ideas that we simply can't imagine without using this method!

The third and most famous strategy in science fiction is the "explanation" technique. In this technique, the world is presented as an explanation of why it exists. The main character has to constantly learn more about the world around them in order to make sense of it - this is how they continually learn more about the environment as well! This technique is often called "exploration" - essentially you are pushing the main character to discover new worlds in order to make sense of it!

As you can see, there are a lot of very similar concepts in science fiction and reality, so this is no surprise that our brains just love to imagine! It's no wonder that science fiction has inspired so many stories and ideas over the centuries, many of which continue to inspire us today. Of course, science fiction isn't all that different from our current world - there is still a lot of very important things that the average person wouldn't understand, such as space travel, time travel, and the eternal life cycle! In fact, it is these concepts that give science fiction its very realism!

As you can see, science fiction and reality do indeed play a major role in our world model. As we continue to explore the rest of the world, we will likely continue to learn more about how these techniques have been used over the centuries. And as we continue to learn more, it might help us come up with a much better world model! Have a great weekend everyone!

Chapter Thirty Seven
An Imaginary World in the Sky

I know it's really strange to be thinking of reality and fantasy, but these two things really combine - our imagination and our reality are like two things that live side by side. That doesn't mean one is better than the other, but they always complement each other. The idea of reality is basically the idea of our inner world - the stories we tell ourselves and how we experience the world around us. In other words, it's the idea of the things in our world that we experience with our mind.

In real life, humans are able to see everything that happens to us in our inner world - in our head. Things such as dreams and visions are all part of this inner world. But if we

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the truth of space-time and its unravelling are the only things that we can really know for sure!

So if we want to understand how things move in the dimensions we perceive, we need to look beyond them! And that's exactly what M&B does. This is where the reality TV show Myers-Briggs is useful!

In this brief and extremely well-crafted article we learn a bit more about M&B. In fact, we're learning a lot more about it than we ever suspected! But before we get into that, let's take a quick walk through this little book first!...

Myers-Briggs is a popular mind testing test, used in a variety of settings. Many colleges and universities, public and private healthcare providers use it to help decide which of a few schools of thought (e.g. Jungian or Traditional) would work best for a specific student's needs.

From the introduction, you can see that some of the criteria used to decide a student is "normal" or "abnormal" are the following:

IQ - which is basically the same as ability (but can be measured in a range from 65 to 120)
EQ - which is a more global concept that allows us to evaluate our "emotional" side
Openness to experience - which allows us to look beyond ourselves to experience what we perceive around us
Ability to control impulses - this relates directly to self-control

Now let's look at each of these criteria in detail. Let's start with IQ! The first thing I found out about M&B is that there really are no hard and fast IQ levels, although those found in other tests (e.g. the Stanford Arithmetic Progressive Matrices or the Pyramid Test of Reasoning) appear to correlate closely. In fact, it was recently discovered that these same tests can be converted into a 4D space-time graph in exactly the same way as the original Myers-Briggs graph; which explains why my IQ score correlates to those of similar test takers who have used the original test!

IQ, of course, relates directly to creativity - this is because our ability to create stuff outside of our brains is one of the primary reasons why we are the way we are - we don't need to think in order to do it!

Now let's look at EQ! This is my favorite of the two test questions. I think it is the only one that lets us look beyond our own world and see other parts of the universe as we perceive them. For example, it is possible for a student to see the difference between people in their native and foreign countries, or even the difference between two different countries. It also allows us to look beyond ourselves and see how different other people are in how they perceive the world. It is also a good test of how much responsibility we have for our actions, since we must consider what we would be doing if we tried to do the same thing again...


Now let's look at Openness to Experience! M&B was designed to give students a different experience as opposed to what we normally experience. It's hard to see how any sort of standardized tests are used in a classroom environment to evaluate student's attitudes to the world! You need someone to evaluate what you feel!...

In fact, many professors have said that M&B is like a test of whether you're actually a human being! Students often say they feel more like students when their scores are higher than normal...and they have no reason to do so (unless of course, they really mean it in the letter of their scores)! 
...so when an unfit student is chosen to attend a college or university, they usually become a lot less likely to follow through with their plans...

And when it comes to Ability to Control Impulses, it was recently discovered that our ability to control our impulses can be changed by exposure to different environments - and this can be done by changing how we perceive our environment at one time, and then by comparing that experience to what we would be doing if we tried it again...just like in our lives! This has lead some people to believe that our ability to control our impulses is an inherent quality of our brains that cannot be changed by our actions!...


So basically, what we can take away from this brief explanation is that our ability to change how we perceive our world through time and space is what we really need to figure out and control to be successful. Otherwise, we will become lost and trapped in our own perception of things, as a result of our impulses and lack of self-discipline.
...and that is the purpose of M&B!

Chapter Thirty Seven
Why Did God Create Space-Time

What about space and time and how they work? Well, from the very first thing that we learned about God, we discovered that He is omnipresent and infinite - meaning that He is not just a few points in space and time, but that he is constantly in motion! And in other words, we also know that it takes a very long time for our imagination to get as far away from reality as we imagine it to be - we tend to think of it as a constant state of flux and change!
So if we're
