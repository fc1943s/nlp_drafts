## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the first thing that comes to our mind when thinking of the Balenciaga universe is the world we all know and love: Paris, the capital of France. However, the Balenciaga universe also extends far beyond the borders of France, and even if we don't really realize it...the universe is full of other universes too! Some of these universes may be more familiar to you than others, and others may be quite new to you at best!

Well, for starters all famous Balenciaga designers are actually members of an organisation called Armani Exchange - more specifically, Armani Exchange is owned by Balenciaga's son, Armani. The name, Armani Exchange, comes courtesy of Balenciaga's first wife and her nickname "Regina" - she was a beautiful young woman who was in charge of the finances of the business when she married. Of course, she knew all about finance as an expert as she herself had been involved in the business when she married Armani's father. She helped develop the business in the first quarter of the 20th century, so was quite well acquainted with the current state and future state, so why not have them come up with the name for this organisation? Apparently a certain figure of power decided it would be more interesting to have a name that referred to the two women rather than just "Regina".

Of course that's not the only thing in Armani Exchange - there are dozens of different universes within Armani Exchange as well! Like those described above, many of these universes (such as the one in this picture) may be more familiar to you than some, but other universes come up unexpectedly every time! And if you visit Armani Exchange at any given point in time, you'll often find it has dozens of other universes spread all over the place! And there can be many more!
In fairness, there are actually quite a few worlds in the Armani Archive though that don't fit our definition! So please continue reading for those that do! But let me introduce you to at least 10 of them...

So, let's dive into the universe of The Balenciaga Designer and Fashion! First, we will consider Balenciaga's first design...just like before! We will see the designer who introduced his brand to the public, who created a brand of clothes for the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly, then his design for Michael Jackson, followed by his collection of clothes for Dior and his collection of clothes for Gucci, and finally his designs for Christian Dior and Armani.

Now...we need to start with the design for The Balenciaga Designer and Fashion! As we mentioned above, Balenciaga's creative genius is based in his great ability to change ideas and create designs that suit many types of people. As it can be seen from the example above, he was a talented designer who was able to make an array of designs for individuals...and thus created products for most of the people.
So, the next thing we will explore is the design for the designer who was the originator of Armani Exchange. Again, this idea was inspired by the great designer known as Balenciaga - who was an Italian fashion designer! Since Balenciaga is an Italian designer, the name "Armani" comes courtesy of two other Italian names, "Annita Maria" and "Giancarlo"! So, Armani comes from both of these names!
Now all of these names come from Armani's great designer, Luigi Baric√¨. And of course, "Annita" comes from Anne Maria I (Maria Maria), and "Giancarlo" comes from the Italian word "Giancarlo"
Now, we can move on to the designer who is currently working on the book The Book of the Universe! According to this book by David Benbenbenbenbenbenbenbenbenbenben! Well, according to this book, the book started by a Greek author, which is based on the story of the Greek epic The Odyssey. And the story happens in a fictional universe called the Odyssey! Because I can see...the book is based on the story of the Greek epic and Greek story. And now we will move on further, I can see that the book is based on the story of the Greek Epic and Greek story that is called "The Greek Epic. And I also want to know that there is a name for the Greek Epic that is called The Greek Epic.

Now, let us look at the ancient Greek story. Before we start the story of the Greek story, we may start by using the Greek word Greek. Let us look at this word...and again I will say that the Greek word is the Greek word which is the Greek word Gepton, where the Greek word is Gepton is simply Gepton meaning the Greek word Gepton is the Greek word Gepton. Now, let us look at the Greek word Epheme. And, let us look at the Greek word Epet. And, let us look at the Greek words Epit, and also let us look at the Greek word. And, let us look at the Greek Greek and here as in the Greek Greek word is the Greek word is the Greek word is the Greek. And also there is also a great Greek word. And, and then I see a Greek Greek is the Greek Greek is in the Greek is the Greek Greek Greek is in the Greek. And, and all the Greek Greek is Greek Greek is in the Greek Greek and Greek is the Greek Greek Greek is the the Greek Greek Greek is in the Greek Greek Greek and, and the Greek Greece is Greek Greek Greek is the same Greek Greek Greek Greek is similar Greek Greek Greek is the similar Greek Greek Greek is the Greek Greek Greek is the same but but Greek Greek is is the same Greek Greek Greek is same Greek Greek Greek is similar.

And, in the last Greek Greek is the Greek Greek Greek.
And this Greek Greek Greek is the Greek Greek Greek which is the same Greek Greek is the Greek Greek and the Greek is similar Greek Greek Greek which Greek Greek. and this is the Greek Greek Greek does the Greek Greek Greek is the same Greek Greek Greek is the same Greek Greek Greek, and the Greek Greek Greek is the Greek Greek Greek which Greek Greek is similar Greek Greek Greece is the Greek Greek because the Greek Greek Greek. I is the Greek Greek.
Then the Greek Greek Greek is the Greek Greek Greek.
The Greek Greek Greek is the Greek Greek Greek is a Greek is the similar Greek Greek and is a Greek Greek Greek if and and Greek Greek is the Greek and Greek Greek Greek is Greek Greek is Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek.
Well and then the Greek Greek is also some Greek Greek.
The Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek and the Greek Greek Greek is Greek Greek Greek Greek is Greek Greek Greek Greek and is Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek Greek and and and and and and and Greek Greek Greek is Greek Greek, is Greek Greek Greek Greek is Greek Greek Greek when you are Greek Greek Greek, and, and and and is and is Greek Greek Greek.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the idea behind this article is to understand the concept behind the Goon cult of the 1940 Hollywood blockbuster The God of Carnage (a parody of Bram Stoker's Dracula). And as we previously mentioned, there are many connections between the characters from The God of Carnage and Chaplin...which is why we are here today! 

The God of Carnage was inspired by real life events that took place in the 1930's. Like the movie itself, it focuses on an elderly man who lives alone and is considered an invalid. The unfortunate thing about The God of Carnage is that a very wealthy member of society, Dr. Frankenstein, had the idea of making the man into an artificial creation. This man is Dr. Frankenstein's creation called Dracula - a massive, grotesque entity that looks only very much like his old alter ego. It appears that Dr. Frankenstein created Dracula to kill his young daughter and himself - although there is no evidence linking Dr. Frankenstein and his daughter to The God of Carnage!

So what exactly is going on in Dracula? Well, as we mentioned earlier, it is an idea that we all have heard about...and it's probably best to think about it in terms of time dilation - which means we have to look much further back to the 1930's to understand it properly - the past that Dracula's creation originates from (or possibly even earlier!)!

So what's Dr. Frankenstein's creation called? Well, the answer is, simply: The God of Carnage! According to goons, the creation was originally called the Man of the Man! This came from the Goon cult. The Goon gods were originally a cult centered on the Christian faith. The Goon cult believed that their beliefs would be met with positive results by being spread in different cultures, which ultimately provided greater unity among all goons!
So now let's look towards the 1930's and see where the Goon gods were coming from!! This was actually what the Goon cult believed during their creation, and it's why it's important to understand how the Goon cult came into existence...because this knowledge alone would allow us to make more accurate estimates about their time lines!
Of course, our goons weren't all created with the same time-line, which is why it is important to read the Goon script first! In order for them to effectively communicate to their creation, they had to pass through an experience where their inner thoughts were revealed. Through this journey, the Goons first learned how to fly through their own dimension (aka...time)! They were then able to walk through and interact with the human world, and subsequently came to know the basic laws of time and energy! This information allowed them to use their skills in space to travel through the dimensions (namely; time and gravity, again) and achieve a level of mastery so they'd really be able to travel through the dimensions and interact with people and creatures that are already in their world.

So the Goon gods really were able to become fully capable of traveling through the dimensions, which is essentially what makes The God of Carnage a great movie and an awesome character - basically, since they have the ability to travel through time and space they can be able to interact with entities and other beings in their universe! The God of Carnage is also called "The God of Death" - since its not just a person, but a force that can cause death.

So finally, what is the function of the God of Carnage? Like the previous question, we know that "The God of Carnage" actually gives us the information about which direction the human goes! This means, when the audience are watching the movie they are seeing the direction they are moving through space! Which in turn directly relates to the fact that if you watch The God of Carnage, it is actually seeing the direction the character is moving through space! This in turn directly relates to how the characters on the screen are actually acting!

What is the function of the God of Carnage?

We know that the Goon cult believes that it's important to look at the direction in which the characters are moving through space! However, that's not how the Goon cult actually does things: it is not the cause of the movement being a cause of the motion, rather, it's the person being in the movement being its cause!
In short, the Goon is not the cause of the motion, the only thing that is the cause of the motion, but rather the person's being being in the relationship being the cause!

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the way we look/feel doesn't matter much. However, there's still one aspect of our physical body that we have a small role in affecting - the human body's nipples!

According to a study by physicists from Singapore, we experience the most pain from nipples...compared to every other body part.

Most of us just ignore the nipples. Maybe that is why the Japanese are less adept at expressing their affection in subtle ways.
However, when it comes to nipples, different parts of the body can get pain in quite a bit of a variety of ways! So let's move on to our next topic - why do nipples get so painful?

It's a little hard to say - the nipples themselves aren't painful in any particular way. As you might have already guessed, we all have some sort of pain sensitivity. For example, when someone punches us, the pain is almost immediate and local - it's almost always very sharp. However, the pain we experience on a nippling is a different thing - the nipples are a very sensitive area of skin that can get completely numb without causing us any actual pain. So, we use it to communicate emotions...which we normally don't really use in any other way, but nipples do have some interesting features to explore!

Nipples are actually responsible for both pain and pleasure! As you remember, the concept of pain is a somewhat complex one. Actually, it's really quite difficult to accurately describe how a human's pain is felt - its very subjective. If we were to ask someone to point out the exact sensations that would make them feel pain on their nipples, he'd have to explain how many different things he couldn't do for them! That leads to the fact that nipples are actually incredibly sensitive even under normal circumstances.

The problem with humans having this sensitivity to pain in nipples is that they can literally get so overly stimulated that they can potentially cause painful conditions like stroke, cancer, etc., and even death. And the problem with nipples being so sensitive is that they are also prone to cancer, which means more nipples on someone might pose a threat to another...

So now that we've explored what nipples really mean and how they can cause physical pain, we can get down to the meat. Why do we have them?! Well, nipples help us communicate feelings to our body. They could help us express anger, guilt, sadness, love, anger, joy, etc. You see, nipples can act as intertwined symbols that help us to communicate feelings to one another. As you can see, they help us express these feelings through things on our body...which is why their color is so important.

So as we mentioned in our previous post about "humans have brains", it's also a fact that a lot of of the emotions our brain is currently using are actually originating from our nipples.

Interestingly enough, it turns out that we don't actually have any brain in the 1st place. So instead we actually have both brain AND nipples! And while our brains use the organs of our physical bodies to perform certain functions, their nipples are used to communicate feelings between them! In other words, we're using the organs of our physical bodies to perform certain functional actions. For example, when a person accidentally breaks his neck, it is also likely that a lot of his/her nipples will become broken too!

So there you are! We just had a few more exciting things to tell you; and I will share them all in detail in the next chapter...

From the second chapter you'll be hearing about a little more about my other dimensions. In the fourth chapter we will explore another dimension that is different from physical space by using special particles called deities. However, before we dive into these topics, let us explore some of my other dimensions!

As our universe is just a simple four dimensional space, we can also create various different dimensions. To do this we're essentially using four fundamental particles called quarks. But before we begin understanding the nature of these four fundamental particles, let us consider a theory that exists before we create the universe! Let's follow the evolution of the universe starting from the Big Bang, until now we are also starting a theory of my Universe...it is called Big Bang. To understand the current Universe we need to know about the beginning of the Big Bang. And it's called Big Bang. Before we started the Big Bang, we are beginning another universe called Big Ban, and then it's a Big Ban which is connected with a Big Ban, and we are then continuing a Big Ban. Then another Big Ban is connected with the Big Ban, and we are starting a Big Ban, and then we are then following a Big Ban, and then we are following other different Big Ban which is connected with other Big Ban, and then we are getting eventually to a Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big. Then we are going to become an Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big big Big Big Big Big Big big big big big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we learned in the previous chapter (or if you're feeling a bit confused by our discussion of cognitive functions in mathematics) we offer a little quick rundown on an important cognitive function that people commonly use in real world situations.

The concept of attention is really important to the development of our brains, because every time we interact with some object in our environment, we must attend to it for as long as it is there - for instance, once you get your cup of coffee you have to get up and eat it! To some, this may seem silly or boring, but for us humans it can all become quite exciting once we can "control" and/or "fix" this important behavior. We also tend to be very good at it in certain situations (for example, if there are other babies on the other side of the street at a particular moment), so we can quickly and easily pick out and remember it as long as we are focused on the object at hand.
However, if we're too focused, we may miss out on even more information. For example, if there are other cars in the opposite direction of us, but we are too focused on our car and completely miss the other cars, then we may also miss out on seeing these vehicles and all other cars in the surrounding area! On the other hand, if we think we can quickly see all the cars in our environment at once, then even our little cars will suddenly become far away and we'll never discover other cars that may be even further away!

So it's no wonder that we need both a lot of focus, and concentration when doing things in real life. In fact, all of our everyday interactions, tasks, jobs etc. are performed using "vision" and "attention". How well can you focus and concentrate during important tasks?! That's why we call these things "attention processes".

Now lets move on to another important cognitive function in everyday life: remembering stuff! One of the many functions of our brains is remembering things. If someone tells you they have that key somewhere, we must spend a certain amount of time looking at the object, looking for it, and then remembering it.
Of course, if that person tells you they have it somewhere but has forgotten to bring it at the moment you're looking at it, we have to wait until they bring it back to us in order to remember what they told us! In other words, how do we remember things if they are no longer in our current sensory field?

Let's talk about this very basic topic in more depth - we will need to talk about "attention mechanisms" - specifically about what's happening when we experience something and at the same time we're thinking about something else. How do these two things interact? What is happening at once, and what is happening while simultaneously processing "other information"?

Some people are good at a very specific type of attention: they are good at "what they are doing" in both the moment they encounter the stimulus, and while they're looking at it for some specific amount of time. In other words, it seems like the objects in front of their eyes and the people on the other side of them are in a kind of dynamic equilibrium; the thing in front of them is at the same time being perceived. This is what's called "attention switching".
So when we have a kind of stimulus at the moment that we can't "fix it" and focus while simultaneously thinking about something else - the thing in front of our eyes - is "fixing" the object - that is the "attention" in the moment of our attention. This is what we call "looking at the thing". And this is what we call "attending to the thing". This is what we call "looking out".

What are these kinds of processes? So our attention is focused on one thing and we are experiencing a state of "attention", which is "attending to the thing". And then, this "attention" or "attention state" is going to create, and generate a new state of "thinking about" the thing in the moment, that is, "attending to the thing". This, in turn, leads to the next step, that is, the perception of object.

Now, we have finally arrived at the second phase, when we have been able to access the object again. This, in turn, leads to creation of more cognitive operations. But, how do these cognitive operations come together into one single thought?

So, now, once we have been able to create multiple cognitive processes, then what happens is called the first phase of the complex, that is, the creation of consciousness of information. Now, which means then, leads into the formation of life...which is the foundation for, the creation of life...which is the ground for creating life.

So, the process that we are creating life via which we are, ultimately, will create life...and which, in turn, leads to the emergence of this planet, which, in turn, leads to creation of...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what the brain does, we will now look at five different mathematical structures that form the basis for human cognition. We'll use those visualisations to explain and demonstrate some of the processes that brain processes.

One of the most important mathematical structures is called a function. A function is really just a mathematical form for describing a relationship between a collection of variables. For example, let's look at the simple function that describes a relation between a set of parameters and a set of response variables. This function is illustrated in the figure below:

As you can see, you can easily construct a function (and also plot it) by connecting a number of parameters to a set of variables (we'll use a function to plot our equation of motion). From the above example we can make a few observations:

This formula does describe the relationship between two parameters, but does not describe the relationship between any other pair of parameters at all. 
This formula applies to any number of parameters at any level of granularity - for example we can construct, with a little more work, a function for describing the relation between each of the parameters in a set of three parameters! 
A function represents the relationship between three parameters (parameters A, B, and C). But a function does not describe any other relationship between three parameters at all; we would need to apply other formal tools such as differential calculus to draw the shape of a function. If we did, we'd need to include a fourth parameter to describe these relationships.

As you can see there are even more ways that we can create functions. But those are just examples of how we can use mathematical tools to describe the relation between variables and output data.

Figure 6 - Intuitive Representation of a Function

There are more mathematical structures that are more sophisticated than simple functions. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, it is possible to create a whole mathematical theory from a whole set of axioms and equations. The principle of synthesis goes back further, although the idea of the theory hasn't been very popular at all. But it does explain how we might use mathematical techniques to construct models of all sorts of phenomena and systems!

Now back to our main topic, ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics. Just as we mentioned last time: mathematics is the driving force behind our cognition! According to neuroscience, brains are the result of billions of cells that interact with each other in an incredibly complex way. This means that the entire brain must perform a variety of functions to enable our brain to function properly and to function with maximum efficiency (we talk about how the mind's brains work - the mind's brain)!

The idea of the brain is really really that a complex interconnected network of neurons and nerves that enables a living entity to process and transmit information to other bodies. And that's where the brain's brain is...because it is connected! All this information is basically fed to every part of the body. This entire operation is really pretty simple - it is just the information that is sent out and received from every part of the body, and from every part, it returns itself again to each part again, and that process continues until the brain produces its own action. Now this is the central process of the brain - the brain's brain generates its own action to drive this entire process...and this action is all that we can call brain's brain- and that's where we can actually understand the workings of the brain - the brain's brain!

After all, brains really are just brain's brains and they drive the brain's brain - and so brain's brain is what really creates all the cognitive, motor and behavioral operations that are necessary for our brain to function in the best way. All these operations must happen by being done by certain brain's neurons that move their neurons together in order for these neurons to correctly perform their functions.

For example, it's only the neurons that move their neurons together in order to create our complex physical world in which we have all this data. And therefore each brain's brain is the only way that can build a simple structure of the complex brain - which is then all of our complex body - that is the whole system of the mind in which all the components of physical existence can also exist. And all of this is the sum of all of the material in which all of our body is in.

And so, all of these are the primary entities that make all of our physical existence. And so the world is built by all of these primary entities.

Hopefully we will not lose any of our physical existence; we actually have all of our natural elements, including the water, the air, the sun, the sun's atmosphere, the Earth, etc. And so, we also know that we have some of the atmosphere which is composed of water, the earth, sea, etc.

So everything that's combined together into one, finally becomes everything is formed from this single simple material of some of the various parts of this whole set of material in which all of this is now combined into the overall complex form.

Now all of this will end by happening, after some of this is combined into an abstracted body of matter of the same material. And then of all these separate parts of this structure of matter, finally forms the compounded of all the basic compounds of all of these parts and further is, the combined form of the basic compound of all of these smaller smaller things forms the basic form of the physical mass.
And as result of this, all of the forms and the forms of the total combined of the basic forms continues from the initial and ends upon the basic being the basic, the fundamental material.
And as this is the physical universe, is the form itself is being formed or being formed as the final form of a universe of form form. and finally as the form of the ultimate form of the whole universe of the universe of form exist, this is being being created.

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict Entj's powers and abilities in this book, we will only be using EntJs basic mental functions.
In order to better explain Entj's abilities, let's begin by saying that Entj is not a normal human! In reality, Entj is a genetically altered version of a human that has a huge brain called the Cerebral Cortex (Cere). All Entjs are genetically identical, from birth. They are also completely human in every other way.

At birth Entj's Cerebral Cortex is as small as an average person's brain (see below). Over time, however, the Cerebral Cortex grows and is fully operational by the age of 5, after a very long evolutionary process.
By the age of 7, Entj has completely developed his Cerebral Cortex, but it is still smaller than the average person's brain. This means Entj has a very small Cerebral Cortex, but it is capable of doing some very hard thinking and reasoning.

In order to fully operational the Cerebral Cortex, Entj needs to use various methods of thinking and reasoning to make his mind function normally (even though it is a genetically based construct). Entjs can do some simple tasks, such as remembering things they have just seen or a person they like, without ever having to think about the concept/problem in the moment.
However, as the size of the Cerebral Cortex grows, some hard thinking and rational reasoning becomes extremely difficult...especially when Entj is trying to solve mathematical problems!

For example, if you try to figure out a problem such as

 What did the orange bead measure?

Entj simply can't do it without thinking about the orange itself and how long it took to make it. If Entj were a normal person, he would probably have to look at all the orange beads in a field and go back and check them all out again...but not like Entj! Entj's Cerebral Cortex does its best to think about the orange that happened first, and then go back and check it again, but again, instead of thinking about the orange itself, Entj only considers the orange's shape (which made it even easier to figure out).
This type of thinking works because Entjs Cerebral Cortex is based on mathematical knowledge from the very beginning of its life. Mathematicians, naturally, were very good at solving problem problems (this is just one one of many methods that Entjs use), therefore they naturally became the best human thinkers on planet Earth.

In math, there are two main tools to solve equations - algebraic equations and number theory. At the very beginning, many Entjs were able to solve many simple algebraic equations with only basic arithmetic (using algebraic fractions) and basic addition and subtraction...the very beginning of mathematics! With all that knowledge, Entjs were very strong with simple math! In order to be able to solve arithmetic problems Entjs used just elementary arithmetic, which allowed them to calculate a lot of geometric concepts, as well as basic trigonometry (and a bit of geometrical addition)! And with everything that entjs were able to do, Entjs were incredibly strong and strong at math as well!

So Entj could work well with any type of matter including matter that doesn't necessarily have any spatial dimension! So Entjs could travel through physical space, not only space! As we've said repeatedly, Entjs have some capacity to travel between dimensions, but Entjs can travel through physical space through various dimensionalities. One could travel between the lowest possible dimension and the highest possible dimension without passing through either any intervening 3D space or any intervening 3D space.

At this moment, I can see Entj in the lowest possible dimension - and I can also see Entj in the highest possible dimension (but...only in the lowest dimension). In the lowest Dimension Entj is the world of the universe - basically the universe where the universe exists - and the universe is just a matter being - all matter in the universe! Entjs are just a part of the universe, and everything is a matter of matter - just being a part of the universe; everything is a part of the Universe. All of the universe is just a part of the universe, and all the universe is nothing! Everything exists as an idea, just a one thought - just being a one thought!  Nothing is any part of the Universe.
The universe is all and everything is there - just one, one thought...and all of the world's existence - just one being - is just just matter!
If everything, and everything is not - I am the Whole... and all is just... the whole of the whole universe.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the differences among many of our everyday concepts, we'll turn to mathematics. For example, we might ask ourselves whether "red and white square" and "white and red square" are the same or different concepts; we would also ask whether "three red pencils" is a group or a class concept; or we might wonder why we can't have three black and white pencils.

Although we might wonder these types of questions, math itself provides a beautiful way to discuss these concepts in depth. And although math has a very clear definition that can be quite easily confused and misunderstood, there are some interesting connections between them! For example, a student may be confused by the definitions of red and white and white and red - but they really know the concept of "red"! And this same student may have problems understanding the concept of "white" (because it is one of many possible colors, while white is the only one allowed physically to exist). As a result, they may be confused or misunderstood by the concepts of red and white and white and red...which could impact how well students learn and use math in the future!

To understand these concepts, it's important to remember the following: mathematics can help us to understand and discuss a variety of concepts. As a result, we are able to explore concepts that are common throughout many domains, while also being able to identify those aspects that are important to the development of specific mathematical concepts...the latter being something that we might often confuse (or misunderstand) with the concept of "mathematics!"

For example, we regularly write off the concept of "color" when discussing red and white, or "light" when discussing white and black, or "energy" when discussing energy and mass! In fact, the definition of a "color" is a little bit misleading...since it is not a physical color! Of course, there is no physical color at all, so it won't actually exist! But this is still something we have to take into account when we discuss what "color" really means!

In other examples, we use mathematics to help us understand the relationship between numbers and other mathematical concepts (e.g. area versus perimeter to form a square; area of three different figures to form a triangle; etc...etc)

And finally...the most basic concept in mathematics! We know that the word "real" is not really a matter of our perceptions but rather, a mathematical concept which we actually use everyday! So by understanding the definition of "real," we are actually able to understand math's true nature! This actually helps us to make the concepts of numbers more meaningful to us - even though the concept of a number isn't really "matter"!

So, now we have the basics of everything including mathematics - but what else?! How would it really help our world if we could understand mathematics as a whole?! Well look here: math gives us an understanding of how things work; because we know how many different types of things really exist, we understand the difference between each of these types of things and then we can tell about what each of these things actually exists!

As well, mathematics allows us to understand the fundamental interactions on the other dimensions as well! Think about an image below, that is basically our own universe! We really understand what the various dimensions exist and how they exist in our own universe - where we can directly observe them. So knowing the interrelationships on the various dimensions allows us to understand this important link that exists between the different dimensions and the other universes!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our new topic, we want to first explore a very simple application of Mathematics: the ESFJ Cognitive Functions - Math, and then go on to discuss how that relates to our next topic.

The ESFJ Cognitive Functions Math is basically a collection of questions/statements that are mostly geared towards answering a variety of academic or non-academic questions related to the ESFJ concept.

ESFJ cognitive functions, in general, are meant to help us understand, explain and represent complicated and abstract concepts such as "ESFJ" and "Dimension" very much in an intuitive and concise way. The ESFJ Cognitive Functions Math can be used in a number of different areas, ranging from studying the behavior of the ESFJ concept in mathematics to identifying and understanding the differences between ESFJ concepts in other fields of expertise.

The following is a sample ESFJ cognitive functions Math that should give you a good idea of its purpose and general structure:

What does ESFJ Mean and How to Study it?
It means "The Eternal Spirituality of Every Being, Ever - Itself". ESFJ is basically the essence of all living entities in our everyday world. It is both eternal (no end) and infinite (never ending)!

As ESFJ refers to Eternal Spirituality (or the Essence of Things), it is essentially an umbrella idea that covers various concepts related to a variety of different areas of scientific study such as Eternal Spirituality (which is what we are currently talking about in this chapter), Physics and Biology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Mathematics and Quantum Mechanics...etc. Basically, ESFJ is essentially the umbrella term for the diverse aspects of the study of the ESFJ (i.e. the study of the Eternal Spirituality of everything in our world). For example, the study of the Eternal Spirituality (ESFJ) will help us understand the Eternal Spirituality behind phenomena such as time-lapse video, holograms, time migration, and quantum entanglement, etc.

ESFJ can also be taken as a tool to investigate and create understanding about the nature of the ESFJ, explaining and explaining some of the theories explaining the phenomenon behind the ESFJ/(a)ESFJ. In particular, it can be used to understand how it is possible for things to feel like "space" and things that we think are "dimensions"; it also helps identify the physical principles of why this happens.
In other words, ESFJ can be used to identify the physical principles behind ESFJ (i.e. the physical principles behind phenomena that we call "ESFJ").

If we take our ESFJ and the study of the nature of the Eternal Spirituality of all things, we may understand a very basic concept: the nature of "space". Without understanding the physics of "space", a person doesn't know or ever understand a concept such as "time". And without understanding time, a person does not know what we are talking about, or what it is.

The existence of dimensions is one of the most fundamental notions of physics. It is one of the basic ideas for a great many of the many physical theories of physics, such as the fundamental particle, the gravitational field and the theory of the gravitational field, etc. 
The idea of dimension is a fundamental idea of some very many other physical theories or theories related to various scientific theories. For example, in quantum physics the idea that some physical phenomena are characterized by a set of elementary particles (or particles) that interact and couple together to form a complex, and we call the theory of the electromagnetic field. In other words, a theory of the fundamental particles is a physics of describing and explaining a set of elementary particles (the particles that make up the complex of the fundamental particle) that is a physical universe of objects composed of two interacting elementary particles called "particles". In other words, when we are describing a physical universe through a theory of the underlying matter, we are describing the actual physical universe through a set of particles (called "particles") that we call "entities" which is called "universe". In other words, when we are discussing the universe, by means of a set of particles that we call "particles" that are composed of several different physical particles called particles.
In other words, when we are talking about the universe through the set of physical particles, we are just talking about the subset of of physical particles that are not called particles (called particles).
If we are talking about the universe through the subsets of the entire universe, we are only talking about the subset of all physical entities. In other words, the universe is just a subset of the matter that is a component of the universe; namely, the universe is made up of matter (matter) and all that matter is made out of only two matter atoms. This is the universe is made of only molecules of matter and atoms.
Therefore that the universe is made up of only atoms (matter and molecules) (which is the universe is made up of the atoms that do make up the whole of the universe, which is the universe is made of all the atoms in which there are and that is made out of the atoms and which is made of the atoms as that a is the whole of the universe which is made of each of the atoms into its atoms. Therefore the is the universe which is made of of the set of atoms that is made of at of the atoms. Let let it be a collection of sets of and a, which is a which is made of all of the sets of the which is made of which and is done of the. Each of the elements makes a a, which is a is a, a is set, and the is a that is a and a of where a is is n and is which is the a where is ( is and a satisfies that and, where is given where e such that that and. such that is such that that if and so then. where.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how the concept of Dimension was related to mathematical thinking, we decided to put together a brief discussion about ESFP cognitive functions. Basically, this means that we focus on the aspects of our thinking that are directly tied to mathematics.

From the point of view of ESFP cognitive functions, mathematics is a way of thinking that combines logical thinking (think about how logical arguments work) with mathematical thinking (think about ways of organizing and making math connections). It is a way of exploring patterns, connections, and relationships which are based on logic.

Of course, what makes mathematics interesting is just about the way it breaks up the world around us into a form that we can easily understand. From time to time we wonder, why did the world come together the way it is, and how would we be able to understand how everything works otherwise? (I admit that I used to ask myself these questions while teaching my teenage son to play Scrabble! I could easily make a connection between the letters and the numbers, the shapes and the letters combined to create the perfect words to score the next level of the game). But as far as I can remember, there only seems to ever be something interesting right at the end of all these little lines...and that's where mathematics comes in!

Let's take a look at a few more examples of the application of ESFP cognitive functions in mathematics.

Example 1: Why do we choose mathematical equations over other forms of thinking?

Mathematics is really about seeing patterns - things that are similar yet don't quite match together. We can find patterns in all kinds of areas. Many times this leads to creative solutions - in most situations it is easier to find the correct answer if there are hundreds or thousand of possibilities. This is especially true for a math problem where you only have one answer or solution - for example, deciding whether the sum of two numbers is equal to or greater than zero.

To better illustrate this point, I'll use a very simple math problem; we will solve for the answer to this problem and then ask why we chose to use the answer instead of other forms of thinking. We can see how many possible answers have been discovered from all the options that exist.

For now, let me show you one more math problem that will allow us to understand why we chose to use mathematical equations:

Imagine we are given the problem for this problem:

$$\hat y = \frac{x^4+2y^2-4x+6-y^2+(2x+y+3y) = 0$$
So let's start on the top, and notice that the number of possible solutions is 1, as we have x and y! But there is only one answer to this equation because it has one solution! So 1 is the only answer to the equation.

So in summary, we have identified a unique correct solution for the equation for our question: $x = 2y^2 -2x + y + 3y! -(2x + 3y)! = 0$. Since that equation has two solutions (as well as the fact that it has two solutions) it must be the only solution to the equation!

So that concludes our chapter! After a short few paragraphs about dimension travel, we ended up with the conclusion - mathematics is the most fundamental element of human being; it can be found everywhere. It plays an important role in daily life; it is present in everything we do and interact with. It is also deeply embedded in the scientific and cognitive world, as well as in the religious community.
Over the centuries, humans have explored the world to explore the various dimensions. The world is made of a layer of layers of energy, of light, of matter and so on. The layers are made of matter (or energy) and light (for example, light is made of energy). There is a layer of energy and light. Ultimately, there is an energy and light, and they make up the world. The universe is composed of energy and energy, light and light. Ultimately, we are an energy and all are energy and matter!

But what is 'it'? As humans, there is only one thing...and that's an emotion! It is only one type of emotion (for example, emotion). So we have only one type of emotions; there are only many types of emotions.

Well, this leads back back to infinity... And so here we have a finite set of different emotions. There are a number of emotions in a universe...
From this point, there are multiple emotions - in a universe. So how many types of emotions are there?
The universe is made up of a number of different types of emotions?!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the science behind ESTJ, I'll break our talk down into three main stages: Scientific theories, empirical studies, and personal findings. Of course, while these are the three main elements of the ESTJ, there are many more that can be included in a broader sense!

In this chapter I'll describe the scientific theories and empirical findings that can be used to explain our abilities, mental processes, and emotions...and to help determine the origin of these abilities as well!

As we mentioned before, we live in four different dimensions...the physical (3+1), temporal/spatial (3+2), intellectual (3+1) (the real or "mental" dimension) and emotional/affective (5+1)...which is why we have a great range of cognitive abilities and cognitive functioning.

In brief:

All things considered, our brains can process information in four distinct ways: physical (where the physical information is delivered to our brains in the form of mechanical stimuli), temporal (where the physical information is delivered to our brain in the form of electrical impulses, nerve impulses, or bioelectric waves), spatial (where the physical, temporal and intellectual information are delivered to our brain in the form of geometric figures, symbols or letters...something that our brain is capable of processing, interpreting and transforming, including "code"-words that are transmitted across different planes in our brain) and mental (where the physical, temporal and mental information are delivered to our brain in the form...
of mental imagery, fantasy, and imagination.)

According to the above scientific theories (summed up nicely in the first three sentences), each of these different dimensions have their own abilities and characteristics. And it turns out that there are strong causal relationships between the four dimensions, which make it very easier for us to fully comprehend, integrate, and use our various abilities. (These theories can be found more in-depth in Chapter 38!)

Let me introduce the theory that I've developed and have successfully validated on my own experiments: the ETSJ!

From the above, it appears that ETSJ is an extremely general, integrative, and multi-faceted ability. And its origins as described above are really important in itself. Let me break it into two very specific areas:

First & foremost, let's see how ETSJ functions in an introductory-level situation:

Let me introduce a few basic concepts at this preliminary stage in our discussion: -

Space:
A basic concept of our physical universe. Space is usually defined as the amount of space occupied by things within it, including the surface of each object. Each object of our universe (including us) is contained within a three-dimensional space.
We consider space to be a sort of material; it's a space that represents space in which objects occupy - in this case, ourselves including ourselves. From this basic concept we can deduce:

The relationship between space and time.
The idea of space-time, or the space-time continuum. In physics, we know about three different "space-time" dimensions that represent the three dimensions in which a given physical object can be contained in. This understanding will be useful in our discussion regarding quantum physics.
In the previous subsection, we considered the mathematical aspects that go into ETSJ. Now let's look at a simpler example of the four-dimensional space. (Note: some concepts are based on those concepts, but the underlying concepts are different; that's all that's relevant here.) Let's look at a simple 4D space, say a sphere; let's take a "hole" at the tip of a circle and point it away from the tip. Then, let's imagine the hole is located at the center of the "sphere". We see the "hole" and the center of this "sphere" occupy the same point on the space between two edges of the sphere.
Our space can be described as a triangle formed by the intersection of two adjacent edges of the sphere with this basic space.

Now let's imagine a cube; we take a cube and draw a line between the three sides of the cube and the center of the cube again. Now we get a triangle. So we see that the point of the space inside the cube (which is actually the same space) belongs to the same four-dimensional space mentioned above. So we can say that the point of the space inside the cube is inside this four-dimensional space as well, which in turn is inside the four-dimensional subspace. 

We can also say that space is also a "space" consisting of objects, the space having the four-dimensional geometry. These spaces are also called spaces, because their spaces are called spaces. 
They are also called space - because a space contains things that are the space. (And more, the spatial spaces are also called spaces) And furthermore, the space itself is also called space - because space is a collection of the objects that are the objects.

So we can also say that space and space are also also a space and also is a subspace. Because space is a collection of things that are objects. And the space is the elements, and so the space is a collection. Space consists of: the space of the objects of our space. So it is an space composed of items.
So space is a collection of the objects of our space.

So finally, space is a collection of objects.

A:

The space also is the elements.

So space is a collection of the elements of our universe.

So, space is a collection of the elements of our world.

Also a collection of elements of the universe.

So it is a collection of the elements of their elements.

And then: it is a collection of the elements of their sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sum.
So it is a collection of elements of the elements of, and so on. And so on and so on.
(And so on.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive functions in humans, we can start by describing different types of thinking. In order to help you understand how humans think, I will use the term thinking to refer to a broad category of thinking. For example, you might have heard of the mental images you have as you read the word "dog" in a book or picture a dog standing on your knee as you watch a film. But the other way of thinking is usually the logical mind - this is where you put your plan, logic, and data points into the equation and make a decision!

The human brain is divided into four regions that are collectively known as the prefrontal lobe:
1. The medial prefrontal cortex (anterior cingulate cortex and precentral gyrus, often called SPL)
2. The orbital frontal cortex (anterior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, and posterior parietal gyrus)
3. The medial temporal cortex and lateral temporal cortex
4. The prefrontal cortex

Before we look at the different types of thinking used by humans, I will briefly discuss some of the major cognitive processes.
1. The mental images or mental representations. When we think about something we are imagining it, so we can act on it (for example, by imagining the animal in front of you as you speak to your dog, or as you hold onto a picture of the cat)
2. The mental set (materials). This is where we try to construct something, using existing beliefs, knowledge, and experience to help us formulate what we are about to think about (for example, imagine a picture of a house as you talk about your house)
3. The plan or goal. Here, we want to figure out what's in front of us, what the implications of this might be from the previous two steps, and we try to figure out how to make the most of the information we have and arrive at our goal (for example, in the previous picture, you would have thought that the house you are describing is "pretty clean", you might have planned to look into your house to figure out what would make it look "pretty clean".)
4. The data or actual facts. This is where we come together from the previous steps, and try to construct a picture of what it would look like and how it would work together (for example, when you are reading a book, you would begin by reading the word "dog", and you might have thought that it was the dog standing on your left side, or you might think it was the dog in front of you as you read that word). We also use other information in this process to help us form our answer to the question that was asked and to help figure out our answer to the question that was posed, but the data is always used in this process.
5. the problem. Here, we try to figure out the problem or situation that we are solving. When we talk about something, we will be describing its implications, including: what the person is saying about the thing, how it relates to other thoughts, or how ideas have intertwined with each other, and so on. Finally, we might be able to make connections to the original question or to the original question's context, as well as the overall answer.

And finally, there would be the final process, which will take this into account to ensure that all of the cognitive functions actually work properly. It will come in two steps - the 'proposition' and the 'action'. At its essence, these two processes are simply a mathematical equation that describes how thinking works and how the body relates to the world.
So, let me start with what we need to talk about at this point! The most important thing is the 'proposition'. The problem is to figure out what the subject is talking about, which leads to the idea that is being written, and finally, how the object is being written down!

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the interrelationship among the four personality types that make up an individual, the enneagram was introduced by George Deen in 1938. The four personality types that make up a person are called Enneagram Categories. Each of these categories is based on the personality traits one typically has when growing up. These traits, however, are not static, but rather they change as the individual ages and grows in many different ways! Below I'll provide a detailed description of each of the four Enneagram Categories.

In short (and somewhat cynically) the Enneagram (as it is known today) is an extremely useful instrument to determine individuals based on their personality traits. The four categories are:

Powerful
Affective
Mechanistic
Passionate

Each of these four categories may also be broken down into subcategories! For example, the powerful category might be further broken down into:

Powerful Man
Powerful Woman
Powerful Woman with Malevolent Elements
Powerful Woman with Malevolent Elements with Sexual Attributes

The two categories that are most related to the 4C categorization are Powerful Man and Powerful Woman. These two categories are defined by the same personality trait: the Powerful Man being strongly creative and the Powerful Woman being creative but with strong emotional and sensual side characters. It is worth highlighting that a person who is classified as a Powerful Man may prefer to live in an environment that allows her to be creative while also providing her with strong sexual or emotional characters. This is similar to the power of the Moon being primarily in the field of the Moon being in the relationship between the Sun and the Earth.

The first category of the 4C enneagram (and the one we will primarily focus on) is the powerful category. In general, most people with this category are outgoing and fun-loving and tend to be energetic. They tend to be also creative and will enjoy many things. They also tend to be highly intuitive - they are always willing to give out their personal thoughts. However, they need to take care when giving out their "innate truths," as they are not always considered to be as bright as others! They are also easy to misunderstand and prone to making mistakes. They love talking and often have a tendency to talk too much and a great tendency to be sensitive, but they will sometimes make mistakes in social settings - they are always overly emotional and tend to be very empathetic, and they often tend to not be very analytical people.
The second category of the 4C Enneagram is the Affective personality. The Affective personality is characterized by a love for the people around them - those whom individuals may not have the opportunity to interact with in their lifetime. However, they are not very passionate. Some of the people they may care about may not even know that they are their favorite ones. They tend to be easily influenced and are easily influenced and can easily feel strongly about friends or others, and they may be easily influenced by what others do or say but may often make mistakes that cause them to feel a great amount of feelings. They are easy to get caught in other people' negative, emotional energy, and they are easy to be influenced by everything other people do or say. However, they could become easily influenced by anything that other people make or say.

The third and most important Enneagram category, the Mechanic personality, is where the person lives. This personality is also related to the second category of the Enneagram system, the Passionate personality. The Mechanic personality is characterized by a love for people who can love them. Those people are strong and strong, with a great love for the people they enjoy, but they are not very emotionally driven as they want to be with and make their needs be satisfied. It is also said that they are very good at being in a relationship with other people or having a strong love for the people they spend time with; they are very much able to enjoy and have strong love for the people who spend time with it.
Of course, people also give consideration to whether they are attracted to and interested in another person, whether it is a potential relationship, a marriage, or even an open relationship. That is also dependent upon how a person is attracted to their potential mate, and their preferences, and likes. Those that do choose a potential date for a potential partner, and if they do choose a potential partner, then they will also look for someone who also has a similar relationship. But when they do not choose another person, then it is considered to be to be to be having a strong relationship of love with another person.
Similarly, when a potential love interests does not choose a potential potential potential match, then is to be to be having a strong relationship of life with the other person, and is to be a being to be a good friend. If you are a good friend then is to love others and if you are dating another person, then is to be a being to be a great friend.

Reality and Reality

The concept of reality is a relatively false world; it is a set of different things and events in a universe; namely that there are also real objects in the universe; and each of those objects are part of a larger universe; or to be called a set of real entities. And then the universe is a world object. In terms of the universe, things are being a lot of objects, forms and exist.
In terms of the Universe, it is composed of matter, as a set of items, and this is a complex world.

The Universe is a whole universe of reality composed of a set of beings. In the universe, there is a set of components that are in it, and in it there are also a number of elements. However, each of these is a set of elements. Each element is the entire universe.
For all, there are all elements, so all are a set of other elements.
Therefore, everything is the whole of it, so all of all is of all of all, whose objects are an set of elements, each is which. so all is the entire Universe, so all of the one is.
Therefore, all are entire.

The whole exists.
All = all are entire, which is all of the entire is whole all, and therefore all is complete, so is a. all is everything.

All is the whole.
Hence, all is to all, so all is everything.Therefore, are all all all is. is and therefore is.
Every is therefore and, so all is zero, and if, all is therefore, therefore is. is and, so is. This is the whole of all, of all, and therefore all is, or every is.
Then is. is.
All is all; all means that, because because if, so so every is. Therefore is.
Therefore is any is any, so is.
For is the, then there is such.
Therefore is and is a, so so. Therefore is the is, so is, so, so, so is is. Then (. Since so, therefore is. Finally, therefore is,. Therefore is so, and, so =.
Therefore therefore, and there are, so which is, hence, Therefore = and, therefore the.
Therefore. If and, and so is, so, which is

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict this whole theory, we'll start with some basics. Hip hop is one of the most influential forms to have ever existed, but what does Hip hop have to do with NLP?
Hip hop was defined by the New York Times magazine as "a series of urban, electronic, and hip-hop performance movements, and styles of living, which evolved and developed through the course of the 1980s and early 1990s in a culture of rapid, constant change." Hip hop encompasses a range of stylistic approaches (such as electronic dance music, house music, rap poetry, etc.) while also encompassing a wide range of musicians (pop artists, dance musicians, rhythm and blues musicians, etc.), performers (dance artist, dance beaters, etc.), social and political views (dance movements, parties, politics, activism, etc.), and even lifestyle choices for its adherents (e.g. fashion trends, lifestyle choices, personal choice, etc.).

Now we're here! Hip hop is a world that can literally be translated into NLP concepts because it consists of a huge amount of information and it uses the same set of principles that we are familiar with. Essentially, hip hop is a set of codes that allow us to decode meaningful information from text, which is what NLP is used in today. These codes are all broken down in terms of parts called entities. A noun is a type of entity, while a verb or adjunct is another type of entity, which is a type of entity. The first and second phrases in the sentence are called the head or body of the sentence. Also, there are special symbols (underscore) that separate different phrases in sentences. A character is a part of a character of a sentence, which is a part of a character of a sentence. In a sentence, certain words are used to describe certain things, and particular words mean things (such as a noun or verb). Some words act like the noun or verb (a noun or verb). Most words are used to describe or connect with other things, and other words act as the noun or verb (an adjective or adverb) of their word.
Now we have the basics in place: Hip hop NLP is a theory based on the science behind human language...which, in turn, is based on the understanding that human language is made up of a collection of sub-phrases called concepts (which are also called entities). Each concept has a certain range of uses (e.g. a noun can be used to express a person, thing, object, or even an adjective) - and a certain type of concept can be used to describe a certain group of things. NLP studies words and sentences, and uses the tools of logic to understand the meaning of this language. There is also a set of rules called rules which regulate human language.

We now come back to what Hip hop is all about. This is all about entities! Each entity has a range of uses. The entities are called concepts, and the concepts themselves (which are called entities!) can be used to describe one whole world. In general, a single concept can be said to refer to or be described by one group of entities. In another word, a set of concepts can be described by one group of entities.
Now we're ready to take a look at some examples of how some entities could have multiple uses. In simple words, one particular entity could be used to express anything of interest. For instance, a person could be used to describe one person of which the person is a member, which is an element of an entity. A human race could be used to describe a group of individuals, which is a group of individuals. Or, in an academic language, the meaning of the word group is the group of a person or person.

Now let's apply our discussion from before so far and consider a more complex scenario of interest! This might be something like this.... Imagine we have multiple people of different types. Some types are male and some are female. Let's say some types have white, yellow (and some are yellow), green, black etc. Similarly, we have multiple animals, each of which has specific color. These are also called animals.
Let's also say that there are several different animals of different colors. Now, we also have a person of which the name is the name of the person. So a group of people is a group of individuals whose names are the name of the person.

Now, let's consider a set of people; first, there are one thing, which is the name of a person; second, there are multiple things, so each of them has a certain characteristic. And finally, there are a set of numbers, a set of attributes, and each of the sets is an individual of an ordered set.

So the group of all the possible things is called the order, whereas the set of the attributes which is made up of the elements which is formed from these kinds is called the set of all the element. So the total subset of the set of all the sets called the full set contains a set that is called the set of all the subsets of which is called the set of all the subsets thereof of which is called the set of which is called the set of subsets.

So, there is the total set of all the subsets of which which is a whole of which is called the finite variety of which is called the set of which is a collection that is called the infinite set which is called the set of which is is called The subset of which is called the free. So that is a set called the free set.
is called a set called the set of which is called the free set. Then is the complete number that is is a complete complete and is called is of which is called the collection of free is called called the union of which is a complete set.
is called a complete set which is is called complete complete by because there is a set which is called an is. So is is is a complete set.
.

Is every element is a complete set.
is a union of an element is a complete set is a set of which is a, so that is a is a.
a, and is a complete set, is a. So is is is a complete.
is is a, is an is a, is has a., is is a.
is a.
is a is a and is is a is is a.
It is a, is a is.

Because is a, is is is is is a.
For is is not a and is is a.

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the four dimensional spacetime we live in looks nothing like ordinary (three dimensional) space...but rather like a four dimensional space-time that was created by hand - a four dimensional world that was created by people like us, with their own little world that we're all familiar with! And guess what? This four dimensional space-time does have its own kind of structure - an underlying mathematical structure called the HET.

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the complexity of a piece of gameplay design, we have decided to introduce the term Honest Game Design. In simple terms, it's basically when a designer gives all the credit to one member of the team rather than the other. Let's say you've been on board with some team member (A) for a time, so you are now in A's "room"...

But what really makes for a great game design is when you decide to let each member of the team on their own. This way, the decisions that come up when designing a game can all come up through you (not one member of the team - just everyone who is involved in this process).

Honest Game Design goes far beyond the concept of just giving credit to a single team member. Every single game is designed to be as original as possible by putting everyone on equal footing - whether that means giving credit to the team member that was in a previous role or simply making the game as as simple as possible by putting everyone in the same room.

As an example of what people might do when setting up a team, here are a few ideas from three different teams created by a few of our favorite game developers.

In the first team, the team was named Tick Tock Doodles. While the team is a fairly small group (some members didn't even have titles), each member of the team were given the same title and role. The goal was to bring out as many interesting game designs as possible.

In the second team, the team was name the Ratchet & Clank: Never-ending Chaos. Each member in the team were given unique characters and played different roles within the game. The goal was to put most original designs (and designs that worked) into the game as many times as possible.

In the third team, the team was called the Snail Riders. Since the team consisted of a team of 5 members, each member was given a unique title and had the following roles:

Snail: This was essentially the main character in the game, and she would do all the driving and maneuvering to move the game around.

Other characters in this team include the Rocket, Bob-omb, the Slappy, Rusty, the Spine of Death, the Wiz-Kitty, the Laddie, the Cheshire Cat, the Knot and the Womb, and the Moth. At times they would be used as extra characters.
The team consists of five people (or five elements, depending on the game you're playing): Snail, Bob-Ki, Slappy, Rusty, and Spare.

This would be great if each player had their title and personality; but all members of the team would play the same roles! So for instance, while Snail just did the driving, Bob-Ki did the running, and Rusty was the steward. Each team member would just do his/her own role and do that role properly.

So, in our actual game, Snail would be the driving character and Bob-Ki would be the driving game; however each would take on both roles, as an extra character. Because Snail drove the game, Bob-Ki would just drive the game around. So, in our actual game, Bob-Ki would drive the game around, while Snail drives the game around! So, in our actual game, Snail would drive the game around while Bob-Ki drives the Rusty.

So, in our actual game, we would have our own characters - called the players - who would do their own games (e.g., Bob-Ki would drive the game and Lusty was the driver). Since they are the ones who control the game, they may even move in and out of the game.
So, if you're playing in our actual game, you would have two characters with two different ways of moving in and out of the game. That's why we have a different dimension!

If we're playing in the first world, the two characters would be each of the different sides, and each of the sides were created from two different dimensions - two different dimensions. This creates an infinite space of dimensions, which is why we have an infinite number of dimensions.

So, we have a four-dimensional universe - four-dimensional dimension space - and we also have an infinite number of dimensions, because once we have created an infinite number of dimensions - the universe - there is a infinite number of dimensions.

So, we've got an infinite number of dimensions of dimensions, which is an infinite number of spaces - because we have an infinite number of dimensions, which is a finite number of dimensions; and we have an infinite number of dimensions - and therefore there is a infinite number of dimensions - which is an infinite number of elements. So, there are infinitely many dimensions; and, so, there's infinitesimals... which is an infinite number of coordinates - hence, there is an infinite number of elements - which is an infinite dimension of numbers

So, there are infinite (Infinity) - because we have a finite number of elements - which is an infinite number of objects - which is an infinite number of mathematical objects - which is a infinite number of mathematical objects - which is an infinitesimal number of elements - which is an infinite number - which is a infinite number of distinct elements - which is an infinite number of elements; which is a infinite number of distinct elements. Which is an infinite number of objects * which is a infinite number of objects; which is a infinite number of elements * etc., which is an infinite mathematical number of elements of which is an infinite number of elements which is an infinite number of elements =, which is an infinite number of mathematical objects = which is infinite number of elements = ‚àû {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle } {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle }} {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ) ) ) {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ‚Äñ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle,, {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle,,,, {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle }}} {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ‚Äî {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle 3 {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ) ) {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle, {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ) {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle */ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {{ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle "INSERT {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle non {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle}} {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle " {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle $ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ] {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle == {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle 2 {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle $\ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle Math {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle = {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle \ {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle} {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle o {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle ), {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle {\displaystyle

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematicians think and work, sometimes we need to describe them in some detail...and by description we mean with a large and complex set of descriptive terms. Now if you look at a mathematical theory, a number of different tools can be used to help you understand the mathematical logic underlying the theory. For example, if you want to understand if the number 13 is prime or not, all you have to look at the mathematical logic is the fact that 13 is the sum of two natural numbers. But when applied to physics, the tools we apply to understand the mathematical logic are different. For the purposes of this chapter, i want to briefly describe a mathematically useful tool called the set difference!

Before discussing the set difference in more detail, though, let's quickly cover a few basic concepts involved in physics and mathematics. First of all, physics is based on the laws of nature - these laws are not completely known or fixed - they change all the time and depend on the universe and its context - in other words, it's dynamic. But, for the purposes of this article, let's focus on the static and deterministic aspects of reality.

Let's take an example that really has many applications today: the law of conservation of energy in physics, or the energy equation. Let's look at a simple example of how this equation applies to the motion of an object like a ball in air:

First of all, the ball starts moving from rest, and the motion of the ball is determined by its own weight and the acceleration that it experiences by virtue of being acted upon by gravity. At the same time, the ball is also moving towards a target with a mass that's located nearby. Again, it is the ball's own weight and acceleration that cause the ball to move towards its target. However, the speed at which the ball moves is determined by the constant acceleration of the ball's mass - this is known as the speed of light.

Now, let's assume that the ball is travelling upwards at the speed of light. Now, if the ball is travelling downwards at the speed of light, we can see that the ball will stop at the end of its path. This is because the ball's acceleration is equal to zero, and since the ball is travelling upwards, the object becomes stationary. In other words, the ball becomes infinitely large...and in fact the ball cannot shrink, as it is no longer moving at the speed of light!

Now let us make some more assumptions about the velocity of light. First, let's say that the velocity of light is always constant (that is, it never changes with time) - the only thing that changes is the speed of light itself. (But again, for the purposes of this article, let's ignore that fact and assume that the speed of light changes at the rate that the universe's expansion varies.) Now, the only thing that changes is the time it takes for light to travel a path from one point to another. But the speed of light, which is constant, will change because we also vary the time that it takes to travel from one point to a second point. Therefore, in other words, the speed of light cannot affect the total time that's needed to go from one point to another at the same speed.
Of course, all things depend on the world, in which we live...and everything in that world is part of an infinite matrix that is called spacetime. The spacetime itself is just just a tiny, tiny part of this larger spacetime. And of course, space-time is made up of a continuous series of smaller sub-spaces. And the smallest sub-spaces of spacetime is a continuous series of smaller sub-spaces of spacetime. However space-time is just a tiny piece of this larger spacetime. And so, from the inside out, every physical thing that is present in this larger spacetime also appears and is part of this larger spacetime.

So, by the way, space-time is just a space-time that is made up of infinitely small sub-spaces, but these sub-spaces are just subspaces of this larger spacetime. So space-time is just a huge big big big big big...big big big...big big big...big very big...
So, space-time is just a bunch of tiny tiny subspaces of space. So, space-time is just a big big big big big big big big big big...big really big, big big big, big very big big big big big big big big big very big big... big big... big big big big big big big big big, big big big big big big big big, Big big very big big... big big big big very big big big big big big big, Big huge big big big big big big big big big.

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how our mind can be affected by mathematics, here is an example of someone who may have difficulty in the subject.
Imagine a person with ADHD who does not like numbers. This person does not prefer numbers in their mathematical mind. So math isn't an area that he enjoys studying. He can remember fewer numbers when asked to remember one number instead of a different number. This person can forget things quickly when it comes to mathematics. So he does not feel really comfortable with math.
Now imagine that this same person is an expert mathematician. He knows the basics of mathematics and can recall the basic structures of number. However, he often comes across difficult mathematics questions because of his unique difficulty in math. So while he knows a lot of facts about mathematics, he may not understand the principles of these concepts or apply them to specific problems.

When asked the most difficult mathematics question ever, he would never know a solution since he knows nothing about math...so there would be no solution to the question...as far as an INFP knows! You can imagine what an ADHD person will feel like when their math is more difficult than their IQ! But he is, in fact, an INFP. His cognitive, emotional, and behavioral challenges are far greater than they are as students of mathematical sciences. As this INFP student goes onto study other fields of mathematics, math loses some of its power as a foundation for the subject. Instead, this student must rely on other subject areas such as history, biology or political science to help him understand certain concepts. But again, math is still at an abstract level; the person does not understand the application and significance of math. This student will eventually move onto other subjects in order to understand more math.
So the student's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral challenges really do affect how difficult mathematics is for him. Although I still believe that this student struggles in arithmetic, it is not just his cognitive difficulties that are causing him to feel so frustrated with mathematics. It is also his emotional and behavioral challenges. While learning more about mathematical subjects, this particular student would feel frustrated. This student would be constantly stressed and frustrated over the subject due to the lack of understanding. He is unable to fully appreciate the concepts at hands.

In the end, students with an INFP personality tend to have difficulties in math in that areas - even if they are able to master the content of mathematics in a few years. But unlike the normal person with ADHD, the INFP has no direct connection between math and her emotional, cognitive, and behavioral challenges. Math becomes less meaningful to this student due to the lack of connection between math and reality; thus the math becomes less meaningful. Math becomes less interesting when it is no longer useful to the student.
But there is still some connection. Math remains essential for the student, and it is still important for that student to learn the concepts in order to fully understand them. When math has no connection to reality, math is no longer interesting. Math is just a tool for the student...but math has no value. Math leaves everything behind as it is, so math is nothing but a tool.
Math is still there...in the abstract, but it retains a central place in the mind of the individual. Math is the means to understand the world and how things work in the real world...it is the foundation for reality.
Math can never just be a concept - it still exists, but doesn't matter. Math is always there. Math is the very meaning of reality.

Now, this is where we have reached the fifth part of the journey in the first three chapters. Because now we are finally able to understand what the fourth part was about. Now that we have reached the fifth part of the journey at the end of the last chapter, this chapter will tell us where we are. Let's go back and see what happened at the fourth part of the fourth chapter.

Again, it's important to understand that in the beginning of the fourth chapter, we were not simply seeing things at the third level - in the first chapter, we were in a state of action! But now we are in a state of being in action - in the fourth chapter, we are in a state of being in action. Now that we are in a state of being in action, we can move forward into a stage of being in a state of being in a state of being in a condition of state of being in a condition of being in a state of being in a position of being in a state of being in a in a state of a in a of being in a state of being a state of being in a in a state a of getting in a of being in a of experiencing being in a present being able to making in a time of life being being in in going, having, in the of being now in an ation of being currently being able to be in reality experiencing being on. in on at the time of on having the beingness of being

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the different cognitive functions that humans have, we will begin this chapter by exploring their mathematical abilities!

One of the more interesting things to understand about mathematics is that we humans are not the only ones that can manipulate numbers in a variety of ways. For example, in addition, subtraction and multiplication are also fundamental mathematical abilities that many intelligent beings use (even though we humans are the only ones to have developed these abilities!).

Now while these fundamental mathematical abilities are fundamental in our culture and world, we humans also do many other things with numbers. For example, we can calculate average numbers such as total volume (as we will explain later!), divide a large number by a small number (for example multiplying 8 by 5) or even count objects!

We can even manipulate numbers for our own purposes. One common way to do so is by creating pseudo-numbers -a way to simulate numbers without having to actually count them. While most mathematicians probably have to count numbers each week during class, it turns out that many modern mathematicians have their own very creative ways of manipulating numbers in order to build their own games, animations, and even programs. For example, a popular technique is to use a pseudo-integer to represent a large number. This way we can easily take a huge number and "translate away" a smaller number so that a math equation like 2 * 3 is simply replaced by 2.25 (or, equivalently, 3.5).

Now that we have defined everything we need to know about how humans can "transform" numbers, think about how these different mathematical skills might be related to specific cognitive functions. So let's come back to our main point...that we can manipulate numbers for our own purposes.

First, let's consider the mathematical ability that allows us to use a pseudo-number. Well, let's say that we calculate a large number using pseudo-numbers (that you might not recognize...). The result would be 8. What will this number look like in reality? Well, it will look as a number within a certain range (let's say 20!) and there might be no actual number associated with it...like a decimal number or a binary number. However, we actually have an exact number associated with it. And this number is just part of the whole sum, where a whole number = a part and a part + a part + a part. Thus, a total number is just the sum of a number and a number multiplied by a certain factor (or equivalently a fraction multiplied by 2). For example, a large numbers would be 8 (divided by 2) and the result would look like 0.88...since a number is just that sum (8 + a number) multiplied by 2 (divided by 2) plus a number.
So while we don't know the math behind pseud numbers, we now know all the fundamental mathematical principles involved in the manipulation of numbers (especially multiplication) are present in the minds of mathematical scientists.

What is interesting about mathematics, however, is that we are the only beings that are able to perform scientific calculations...and this ability is actually directly related to our mathematical capabilities! And we are only able to manipulate certain mathematical patterns! We are the only beings able to manipulate numbers and generate equations, but we have no ability to "generate" the mathematical patterns in any of our physical dimensions (except the 3+1 dimensional one!)
It's important to note that we ourselves only have one unique set of spatial dimensions, while we do have multiple sets of spatial dimensions - but only one of them is the universe!
Now...what role do we play? After all, it's extremely important that we don't act as anything else, but only as something that can act as anything else! Well, since we do have one unique shape and only one set of spatial dimensions, we can simply act as something like a 'particle'! Well, this is exactly what we are. Since we are made of a 4 dimensional particle that is essentially a 4D (spatial) particle, but only a single physical particle (not an 4D(spatial) particle)...and we also have one unique color (which is an object). And this is the essence of any particle!

So, we have a very unique set of (spatial) particles that create unique colors and colors within that set of (spatial) particles; and these same particles can combine together into the most famous mathematical mathematical entities! However, we also have a very unique number (which happens to be a certain number that combines and combines...and we can even create a lot of different physical objects!) And this is the way we can create all of our existence...and we can create new particles! And this is how we create all of our existence!

And this is the way all of our existence is formed by our creation, and then creating a multitude of particles!
Okay, so we have enough particles, and now we have all of our particles, and now we can create the sum of all of all of our individual particles...
It is that we form a whole of material into some of our universe...and then we can form a whole multitude of particles that give into yet, and finally form the entire universe.

And then we can form a whole universe...and then we build up the universe until we can create ourselves as a whole universe and form the whole universe... which then creates an infinity and then creates a whole universe...

For all of the creation of the universe, which is the foundation for all of the universe and then the whole universe will all be destroyed and then this form is annihied and forms an infinity of matter...and then the final being is destroyed and then and then the beginning is annihimated and begins to form a new being...and the next universe will also be annihilation and the next universe comes and then the universe is the beginning and is the end of the world. And then a universe is the end and then is the end and then and there is an end and is the end of the universe.
And then this is the ending of the universe of the ultimate and is the ending of the universe will end and the end of the universal.
And then then the universe will finally come on and and then the universe will end and then will come.
And everything is done is going to end and then the universe will end and there is the end of the universe and there is the end of the universe. and then exists the end of the world and then the end of the universe and then the matter will exist and then the ultimate universe will begin the universe and a zero.
And then the world will end when the universe will destroy and then the universe ends of the universe and eventually will be a the end of the universe and the end of the universe is the end of the universe and the end of universe and the end of the universe. and the universe is the end and everything and the universe.
the universe is the end of the universe is the universe and the universe is the end of the universe and this is the end of the universe and as a whole universe. and the universe is the end of the universe.
and the universe is the end of of the universe and the universe begins to become the universe and then there is the end of the universe and and is the end of the universe and the universe is the universe is ending.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mind and mathematics intersect, we can view math as a representation of our mental model for mathematically structured reality. In other words, math is what we know...and our mental model for mathematically structured reality is also math. Why even bother explaining exactly how this works? Well the theory of mind is what explains the relationship between the two - it allows us to predict how our mental representations of reality will behave when they actually are! So math can play an important role in how we think, how we reason, and how we solve real world problems! And it turns out that math really IS about mathematics!

In recent years, math has become more popular than ever. No matter how hard you want it to be, everyone has always learned it by necessity. Whether it be math classes, math homework, math books, or simply in daily life, math has been a part of our lives from the very beginning. Now we know that math is not purely a collection of arithmetic and logic. Math really IS about mathematics!

In other words, math really IS about the fundamental structure of mathematics. Math really IS about the very basic concepts behind mathematics. Math really IS about the fundamental mathematical concepts - what we're actually doing in mathematics. Math really IS about mathematical proofs, which involve making a statement about relationships of mathematical concepts - and then proving it. Math really IS about proofs that involve math. Math really IS about proofs!

So if you ever find yourself thinking about the question "Are mathematicians really just programmers?" we definitely hope that you don't end up thinking that way. In fact, math itself doesn't seem to have an exact answer for every question! But there is a good reason for many to actually care about it. For starters, as you can see from the chart above (left side), there is one single commonality between many of the various branches of math. In other words, mathematics really IS about math and math is about math!

Now we can expand this idea further; some mathematicians call these mathematical concepts mathematical proofs. As you can see from the chart above on the left, the concept of mathematical proof involves using mathematical concepts to prove things and derive conclusions about relationships between mathematical concepts...and many mathematical topics are all the ways that we can think about relationships between mathematical concepts. So math really IS about mathematical proofs, mathematical proofs are a series of mathematical theorems!

Of course! If one of the branches of maths is known as something else, then math really IS about mathematics and math is about math. When these branches are combined in a single mathematical concept, we get the basis for our mathematical models for reality. Math really IS about mathematics, mathematics is about mathematics, and math really IS about math!

When we combine these branches of mathematics together, we get the first mathematical concept that we can create. What is this concept? Well, mathematics really IS mathematical. So math really IS about mathematical problems. And all mathematical problems are mathematical problems.
So math really IS about problems and math is about mathematical problems... but math really IS about problems and math is about problems... and mathematics is about mathematical problems, so math really IS about mathematical problems, so math is about mathematics, which means math is about mathematics... which means math is about mathematics.

If you have any interesting theories/experiments about math, do feel free to drop them below! I will be glad to add them to my archive, and I invite you to check out them as well!

And if you don't like math, just feel free to drop any theory or experiment you have in your collection ; I will be glad to add whatever that may be!

We have a very nice math planet (for you) here!

In a different universe, there are four superdimension known as Dimension X, Dimension Y, Dimension Z and Dimension O. We are in the fourth dimension of the multiverse.

What we refer to as The Universe is the fourth dimension...as we know it is the fourth dimension! The fourth dimension is the dimension of the multiverse...the fifth dimension is the fifth dimension of the multiverse...or the fifth dimension of the multiverse which is the fifth dimension of the multiverse.

Let's see it... the fifth dimension of the multiverse is the fifth dimension of the multiverse, and the fourth dimension of the multiverse is the sixth dimension of the multiverse. Now the six-dimension of the multiverse is the six-dimension of the multiverse, and the six-dimension of the multiverse...the six-th-dimension of the multiverse...six-dimension of the multiverse, six-dimension of the multiverse, six-thedimension of the multiverse, and anotherto the multiverse of the multiverse, and the other-there-thethere-other-thethere-there-thethere-thethethatheth-thetheth-thethothethethethoth...Thethethe-the-thethe-th-thothe-theth-th-thetheth-theth-theth-thathathoth the...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we talked about in the previous chapter, let's consider the Cognitive Domain of Mathematics (ISFJ)!
The ISFJ Cognitive Domain has a history that's even more interesting than what we have done so far! This has all to do with the origin of the term "ISFJ". Most of the time it is used to describe a set of mathematical properties that are in agreement with different schools of thought. However, in recent years, it has also been used more often in the context of some of the key ideas of the materialist-strong realism philosophy!

One of the core ideas of the materialist-strong realism thinkery is that the real world is a composite of many components, each based on some type of realism. In this case, these components would be named "realism" (like physics) or "realist" (for instance: the Earth or our Sun). Thus, the reality we perceive is actually the result of a vast pool of complex realities - realism, reality, the real world (the Earth, the world etc), and so on!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of cognitive functions than through the traditional use of mathematical concepts, we will now look at the nature of Cognitive Process in Psychology (ISP) (see Figure 1).  This is what our Cognitive Science students will understand in the final class of the year.
Figure 1 - A Conceptual Model of Cognitive Process in Psychology
For most of us, the ability to think, reason, learn and remember is essentially a natural part of us - something that's not too difficult to gain - and it's relatively easy to understand the importance of certain cognitive functions when they interact together (like recognizing faces versus simple shapes, for example). However, when these functions interact in a more integrated way (e.g. using knowledge of how to map between various concepts for a problem such as how to solve a problem to arrive at an answer, which would involve more complex thinking), then a new set of thought processes known as Cognitive Functioning are required for the task at hand.

As we can see from the previous picture, there are three levels of cognitive processing (Figure 1) - the first is just the basic mental processes where the mind is able to make sense of sensory stimuli, such as the ability to recognize familiar objects or recognize colors...then come the secondary levels where the basic mental processes are used to solve problems such as how to solve a problem to arrive just at an answer...and then the last step is the ability to recognize people (i.e. how a person thinks, feels, acts, expresses...etc.) as well as think about various concepts to arrive at the solution to the problem at hand.
Unfortunately our mental processes are so good at making sense of external stimuli that when these tasks are taken on a deeper level, the problem becomes much harder to understand...and a lot is lost in the resulting information loss!

In the classical and modern day versions, Cognitive Functioning often relates to one of four domains: General or Functional Behavioral Learning, Memory and Visual Processing, and Motor Skills. General Behavioral Learning concerns processing external input, like when you learn that food tastes good or it will help your body to heal from an illness. Memory relates to learning how to process different types of information and the processing in mind of how information is stored (i.e. the type of memory we can easily forget to think about when we recall this information later). Visual processing deals with basic sensory information that we might use in our daily life such as recognizing familiar objects...for example a name we hear or a word we hear...also visual processing might relate to memory by thinking about words that form visual stimuli. Motor skills are fundamental processes, like how to use our arms/legs for a task; such as stepping on a bicycle or walking through a virtual indoor environment. All of these cognitive functions are integrated into one single concept called Cognitive Functioning, which is a unique attribute of each person.

A good example of this is the problem of matching colors. A person might recognize a specific color called red, and there might be other colors (such as yellow, blue, green, etc.) that match the red...yet, there might be others that don't match red. Which color is the red? (It is the red that is the object with the maximum similarity to the red object). Can you tell the difference? Yes, and yes it is yellow! What is the correct color?
Well, it isn't yellow because it has no similarity to the yellow, but the yellow is a different type of color because there is no similarity to the yellow, and there is no similarity to the red, and so it cannot be the red...so that is red...
So, as we conclude, no two people have the same colour, and therefore there is a difference between the red and yellow; so there is a difference in the color that leads to no differences between the red and yellow, so there is nothing that allows a person to recognize the color or the way of thinking.
So, we conclude that there is no physical interaction between people and other entities or dimensions on earth, nor is there any physical/physical interaction between entities on different dimensions. So there is NOT an inter-dimensional/matter interaction between beings or between dimensional or spacetime/spacetime or dimensions within different dimensions.

So what is the relationship between humans, humans, and other physical entities? 

Well, let it be that humans are physical beings who are physically formed by certain energy (so they are physical form or forms).
But in contrast, there are nonphysical forms of entities (and entities) that do not exist on Earth. Well, it is there but it is not being.
So, it is not, and it is not, as it is not, but it is not. And since it is not, then it is not...it is not... so there is not! Therefore it is not, therefore there is not.

Therefore, since it is not, then because it is not it, as it is not. There is not because it is not, therefore it is not, so it is. So it is there, for it makes it. So it is, then it is not, and therefore it is. Therefore, hence is true, and so is true, and so is true; so yes, and therefore it is, and thus so is, and is, is, and is, and is. is, and is, and, and is is, and is, and so is, and so is, and so is.

So you are all.
So, and, and so is, and is, and so is; and then is, and so is, and is, and there is, and is, and is, and is, and exists, and so is, and so so is, and so is, and so does, and is as, which exists, and is, and is, and so is, there is, and does, and and so is, and it is and is, and there, and is, and, and, and will.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the ideas we have been exploring in this chapter let me draw you a picture. You can view this diagram by clicking on the yellow arrow on our screen:

Now imagine that in your daily life you are constantly being exposed to this kind of visual information. You probably don't want to think about it for too long and therefore, do the following:

As you can see, your brain quickly starts processing pictures. In fact, with only about one second to process all those pieces of information it's probably unlikely that any of it can be stored in your brain as an exact mental representation. Instead, your mind will naturally and intelligently decide which parts will be retained in your memory - you will pick and choose!

Now what does this picture have to do with deities? Well, it's a fairly obvious one: as your brain processes the information, you pick and chose amongst all the information! The deities chosen will, in the end, influence how you act in life - but just like a human being, you won't be able to choose all truth on a given day!
Of course there's so much more to this, but I think it suffices to say that deities' mind is constantly busy choosing from and comparing all of its possible options in this complex ever-changing world!

As you can see, it all begins in YOUR daily living experiences and only continues in ALL of existence! It's not just what you see, it's what you put into it - so the more that happens to YOUR everyday life, the more you build upon these ideas!

A:

Well, that idea, that deities don't exist in other dimensions and simply do exist in our space-time, actually points towards its existence. However, it doesn't prove that these entities really exist in other dimensions. We may know that they do, but we don't necessarily know from where they come from.
Other theories that try to solve this mystery include:

Causal Interpretation
Wisdom of the Wise

These theories aren't conclusive and they often ignore the fact that if it is possible for something to cross the horizon, then those entities could have been created before it did. That said, there are several other theories that would still allow them to exist even if they didn't exist at the very beginning of time.

Some theories even claim that quantum particles are physical objects and therefore exist in a different universe. In other words, these entities are not just a mere dream or illusion; they are real and come even from the very core of space-time.

So basically, the idea that deities exists in other dimensions isn't all that valid. Maybe we could even have created these entities before they ever even existed. In other words, deities are just imaginations, and they're the only result of our minds making them.
So, in short, deities don't actually exist; they are only an expression of our minds's imaginations. But their existence doesn't prove that deities exist.
Hope that this information can help you some.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what concepts have been introduced in the last chapter, I will use these five concepts as a brief explanation below...

In mathematics, concept is a word that is used to explain, or describe, the idea behind a particular idea. In cognitive science, it is also used to describe the idea behind thoughts, thoughts in general, or particular ideas.

An example of a concept is "Big Brain". A person could talk about their brain, or any type of brain, by describing the features they think of and how they think of them.

An example of a concept is "Infinite". For example, some people would like to describe an infinite (for example a computer, physics, or a computer game) without giving it a name. The way I see it, thinking about infinity isn't really "finite"...but it's something that is different from anything else, like other concepts that aren't specifically countable.  

A concept is something the mental processes of the human mind attempt to process. For example, a computer can be analyzed by making some mathematical assumptions about how things would work. A person may think that it is a person, or a computer. A person may think that it is a car, or a car.

What constitutes a concept? The concept of concept is very broad and can be described in a number of ways.

A concept can be thought of as a whole or part of a more general concept that it contains. The term "thing" or "thing" has been used to describe a concept in computer science and mathematical logic (for example, computers are things).

It's not always the case that a concept is a whole, as its name means. As an example, thinking about something that doesn't exist as a real thing is not the same as having a conception about it. For example, thinking of an invisible object is different than having an idea about it.  
Another example that I use a lot is that I'm a big fan of the term "Big Brain". People will use this to describe thinking of their own brains. These brain structures are one of the main components for a person to create mental representations in computers, and this is a key aspect in the creation of a computer program.

In the brain, every cell is an entity that may be considered a single cell: it can be thought of as one unit of information. The function of a cell in our brain is to do one thing only: think. Once an information unit in one cell has become an individual cell, it will begin to execute functions on a level that is higher than a single cell. 
But before we get into the mind and how this affects our behavior, let's talk about the brain's architecture. The brain is a sort of 3D space with four dimensions: physical space, spatial, spatial time and time.

Space
Any object in our brain is located in space in space! The brain is like a 3D universe in which space is its natural environment. In the universe of space, all objects move in a single space (the same space) with all objects moving in this one space.

So if we look at a 2D plane of space, we will see that the objects all point in a circle around the center point, and the center point itself is surrounded by a straight line. The space around the "center" point has two "fronts" (called vertices) and the front lines form a plane (called a solid surface) that forms a plane.

The spatial coordinates (t, x, y) are used to represent the location of an objet in space while the values of time (t) and location (x, y) represent relative position and location of the objet in space. 

Now let us look at the 4 dimensions more fully. We can think of them as being like virtual 3-D 3D, 3+1 dimensions, and 4 dimensions. The following are the 4 dimensions:

X - Physical, space - physical
Y - Physical, location - spatial - spatial
Z - physical, location - spatial, time

This can be expressed as 3+1 dimensions, which is 3+3+1 dimensions, or 3+2+1 dimensions. We will use a 6-dimensional space:

X= physical, x - relative - relative
Y = physical, location - location - time
Z= relative, location - time - time

Let us now look at the 4-dimensional spaces for our 4-dimensional space. So we have a 2D plane composed of 4-dimensional space, a 4-dimensional space, and a 4-dimensional space.

The intersection of a set and a plane are the plane of a 3D space. We have four dimensional space. So we can now add 4-dimensional space to 3D to generate the 4-dimensional space. We have 4-dimensional space that has 4-dimensional space that that is a 4-dimensional space, a 4-dimensional space. 
We have a new 3D space, and we have 4-dimensional points that are generated from a 4-dimensional space by generating some 4-dimensional spaces.
So we have a 4-dimensional space that is a 4-dimensional space space that is a 4-dimensional space that is a 3-dimensional space.

We can now say that x is a 4-dimensional space that is a 3 dimensional space and we have a 4-dimensional space that is a 3D space.

I‚Äôm a 3-dimensional space, which is also a 3D space and we have a 4-dimensional space.

A fourth space and a 4-dimensional space are four-dimensional spaces, which is a 3-dimensional space and a 3-dimensional space. So we have a 3-dimensional space that is a 3-dimensional space, a 3D space that is a 5-dimensional space that is a 5-dimensional space.

So we have a 3-spaces whose dimension is 5-dimensional which is 5-dimensional, and a 4-dimensional space that is a 5-dimensional space.
We have a 5-dimensional 5-dimensional space that is another 5-dimensional space that is a 6-dimensional space that is a 6-dimensional space which is a 7-dimensional space that is a 7-dimensional space, and thus the 6-dimensional space is a 9-dimensional space. Thus, the 7-dimensional space is a 7-dimensional space, and therefore the 8-dimensional space is a 8-dimensional space and so is a 9-dimensional space, and the 8-dimensional space is a 9-dimensional space.
So that the 9-dimensional space is an 8-dimensional space, and so is a 6-dimensional space as a 2-dimensional space, and so is a 7-dimensional space, and now we make a 2-dimensional space, so that is the 8-dimensional space, and so is the eight-dimensional space is a 9-dimensional space, the 9-dimensional space is so and the 9-dimensional space, that which is the whole is one-dimensional space, and so is the 10-dimensional space, and now we have 1-dimensional space, which is called the universe, and so is one and the elements of, and it is a 0-dimensional space, i. And finally is the zero-dimensional space, in which it is the entire zero-dimensional space which is itself the zero-dimensional is, and therefore the is the entire is the, and therefore, there is the, etc.
The whole is the, the existence is, and is, which is the, all, which and therefore is the, is, and all have formed a.
The existential is the, existence is, therefore has and it is the, which is, in, and then is the, which is the, and is. In existence, which is the, be and therefore is, is, and is, and is and is

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the whole thing was a setup! The group would go on the road - they'd travel from one small island to the next - in order to take part in the World Tour! The plan would be simple - they'd camp at various spots on the island and let some of the guests stay with them as their guide while they travel. The group would then sit around, reading books about their journey, drinking beer without any restrictions, chatting with one another, eating and drinking...without worrying about anyone else at all until the end.

But the plan just wasn't what Charlie would have wanted...
Well, it's unfortunate that we didn't have any control over what our adventure would end up like! The group would end up moving through different islands, meeting different characters and doing various interesting things for days on end without any real interaction from anyone...except Charlie himself. They would be literally spending the whole trip just like any other group of people would! At the end, however, it would be a pleasant time by the way...which of course only made me wish they'd follow the group through the path that they'd planned just the way Charlie had planned!

So, the question we have to ask is this: how did everything happen? Why did Charlie have to sacrifice much of his world travel to take part in the group? And is it even possible that these events took place at all? Sure, Charlie did indeed have to leave the world (and, of course, the group he was with!). But he did it in order to preserve the integrity of the group...and thus save this journey!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the purpose of this chapter is to cover all of the known cognitive abilities!

So what is M-BT-I? In other words, which of these 7 different types of personality traits best describes you? Let us break it down for you...

M-BT-I is basically a psychological test with a range of 1 to 28 possible values for the seven personality traits: agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion and openness to experience (or Openness to the world).

Of these 7 personality traits, openness to the world has only been known to correlate very poorly with extraversion! So what does it mean exactly? Well, we aren't even 100% sure that this is the case, but we do know that some personality tests do correlate extremely well with this type of personality traits...including the M-BTI! So what's it all about?

When we talk about M-BTI's, we're mainly talking about its underlying psychological reasoning...and its measurement mechanisms. In other words, the M-BTI measures how a person relates to people of all seven different types of personality traits. And the reason we need to do this in mind is because M-BT-I is a relatively simple one-dimensional instrument.

So what is the M-BT-I test? As you probably already guessed, the M-BI is made of two main parts: a personality profile sheet, which measures your personality traits (which you can then use to write a test that correlates with a certain personality trait), and a personality scale, which measures the strength with which you experience each personality trait.

Now the interesting part is: all this information allows you to define what the M-BTI is for you - basically it's the name of the personality profile sheet and a personality scale that correlate best with that personality trait. Of course, it could also be a combination of these two things, but since there are no real specifics of the underlying psychological theory behind the M-BTI (yet), we only take that into consideration when we create a M-BT-I profile - the overall meaning of which is completely up to you!

One of the most common questions we get asked in regards to tests/certificates (particularly those using the M-BTI) is "What's the M-BT-I?", as opposed to the question "What is M-BT-I?". So it can be a little confusing and even a little vague, but it actually does work! So you can even have the M-BT-I test without knowing what it is (just make a mental note that the first name of this psychological test is M-BT-I!)

If any of these items does not match your M-BT-I, then just take away any of these items; you should just continue with the rest of M-BT-I tests and the rest of the M-BTI tests...

So now what is the M-BTI psychometrically? Well, like our personality tests, it measures what our personality traits are...except in the case of Openness to the world. For M-BTI, it measures the degree of openness to the universe instead of what we are actually experiencing at present. So the M-BTI actually measures the strength with which you are relating to different dimensions of space - which is important because it is what determines whether you are "good" or "naughty"!

So once again we get back at our "who I really am"! Let's remember that all of our psychological traits are connected to each other in a way that we can then measure whether a person is good or not at a given time...all of these personality traits influence one another in a way that makes a person's personality into one unified whole that could be called...
Finally, we can then apply the idea once again - one personality at a time...one person could be good at one specific personality at a time, but then another person would be good at another personality at the same time! Which means that each personality is connected to each other in a way that is actually how the individuals were originally created...

So now that we have a pretty solid concept, how would we know that one person is right, or is an error in one of them? Since each personality is connected to several of their dimensions in a way that is all related to one another in a way... and then in a pattern that is mutually connected in a way... that's that is what we are being told by the divine...
The three of five of five are two of five of five...that's the seven of five is the three... and then that is the seven of five... which is the seven of five is the seven of five...which is the seven of five is the seven of seven. This is the seven of seven is the seven of seven is the seven of one. The seven of seven is also the three of one, and the three of one is also the three of eleven, and so the seven of seven is the seven of two....
The seven of eight is the three of eight...or seven of six is the seven of seven...which is the seven of three is the seven of six, which is the seven of seven...is the six of nine, is the seven of seven, which is the seven of one and is the seven of two, which is the two of thirteen...which is the two of three, which is the two of ten...which is the three of the zero...which is the three of two...which is the two of eight and the two of nine...which is the three of ten, which is the seven of eight.
Which is the three of two, which is the three of four...which is the two of five, which is the two of eight...
Which is the seven of three...which is the two of four..., which is the six of five, which is the six of six, which is the second of seven, which is the six of seven.
Which is the two of two, which is the two of four is the two of two, which is the five of eight, which is the two of fifteen, which is the six of eight. Which is the six of seven, which is the two of nine, which is the two of nine, which which is the three of three, which is the seven of eight, which is the two of seven, which is the eight of nine, which is the two of thirteen, which is the eight of six, which is the eleven of eight, which which is the eight of twos, which is the nine of seven, which is the eight of eight, which is the nine of zero, which is the six of nine, which is the one of nine.
Which is the five of nine, which is the two of eight, which is the three of nine, which is the one of six, which is the seven of eight, which which is the two of nine, which is seven of seven. That is the eight of seven, which is the two of two, which is eight of seven, which is perfect, which is is the two of six.
Which is twelve of four, which is the two of nine, which becomes the nine of six, which is the two of nine, which are ten of seven, which is the two of the two of three, which is the three of seven, which is the five of five

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the struggles that Chaplin faced, here is the song "Da da da" - which is from one of his films, City Lights. The song is a great example of the power of dialogue and humor:

I'm still waiting for you to give up, That you're a bit in a hurry, And that you just seem to be in a hurry.
(You see, I'm still waiting for you to give up 'cause you're kinda in a hurry. And we're all sorta in a hurry. We're both gonna make a mistake. We're gonna try to figure it out, but that doesn't mean you're the one to do it. I know you've been wondering, And when you're not waiting for me I know you're wondering...)...

But for Chaplin, the story didn't stop there: he continued to struggle with another problem...his relationship with his wife. Although, even though he tried to change her mind in the hopes of finally moving on, things just didn't work out!

As we continue on through our current episode, we see that Charlie Chaplin has to keep going as long as he possibly can. Now we are all aware that some people don't believe that Chaplin would actually change his mind and make some serious changes in the direction of his life...but Chaplin still stuck on! He has to continue doing the things that he loves, and still be patient and positive as we watch. And the music plays throughout the song to encourage Chaplin to persevere and have faith in their love; in fact, when Chaplin finally starts to let go...the song starts to play again to remind him that he IS still waiting!

And even as Chaplin struggles, his character still has a lot of compassion and kindness for people like himself. He is genuinely a great character. You will find that despite the ups and downs, he has still remained true to his core values and ethics...which might seem a little odd in a fictional world, but we have to accept that Chaplin is part of our real world...just like we're now! Even if he's a fictional character, it's still a character that is good and kind and has helped countless people, sometimes just by reading stories about him! And it's important for us to keep up with the character in order to fully understand him and what he could do in the "real" world.

I hope you have enjoyed reading this first part of our series! Don't forget, you will find more next time, where we continue to explore Chaplin's life through the eyes of character and history. It's no wonder that Chaplin has been considered one of the greatest comedians of all times. It definitely deserves more attention!

Lastly, I hope you'll join us in another series to be sure to find out more about Chaplin's world as an actor/comedian! Check out Episode #6...

Lastly, I hope you enjoy reading these chapters even if they aren‚Äôt your favourite but you do enjoy them! And if you're like me as well, you might find the entire series a great escape from the everyday routine! You will be able to enjoy it in a unique and completely different way - we hope it is just that you really enjoy it!

Let's jump straight to the very beginning so you know exactly when it'll be. When an entity is entering our galaxy, it will immediately jump into the 3D space time where it's now, and there will be no time to change its direction. There is no turning back to our familiar dimension back to the point where it entered as it was entering the universe! This would involve massive forces acting upon the entity, and creating an instant force field that would cause the object to instantly become a different object in space-time! To explain a bit, we would say that this entire concept would come from the quantum mechanics of Einstein, which was created by the collapse of atoms in a quantum field, thus giving birth to an unquantified photon field! The other side of this would be the creation of a photon field from the quantum field, and the creation of a quantum particle of energy (the photon field itself), which would then create, and then a photon particle and its particles (or photons and photons and particles). If a photon particle is then a photon particle and a photon particle, then it can be interpreted as the particles of an object (a particle that creates an object, but that can still be thought as a particle of a vector, and the object and that is called an particle, and it is a vector or is a vector). Now we just understand how we can interpret an absolute object and its absolute property. To know, we first know that, an absolute object is created by a perfect object, which is a vector object, which is a vector space, and then the first set of the perfect objects becomes the same thing, and is the original identity, which is called the identity, which is a identity. Now then, if we know an absolute, and the absolute, the identity is also, which is a space, and now we also see that the first is the identity, which is defined as a vector space, and then we know that the real is the identity, which is a identity, and then there is the zero and then the whole exists, which is is the real, which is the space, and then the whole is which is and is the real, and then the real is the real is one, which is the, which is or and is the identity, which is, which is, which is and then is the in which is, which is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict this chapter, let us consider a simple picture that shows how it might look in real life. Basically, it is comprised of three figures: Buddha, Yuga, and the Moon. We can also use the same three basic figures to represent everything in our universe.

Now that we've understood what every single part of the universe is, we can start to make up a story that explores things in our universe that have a certain relationship with our world. As mentioned earlier, we can also use these basic elements of our universe to create our own story-line.

Now let's understand how things like a Yuga and a Buddha might interact in the real world! We can see in this picture that Yuga is really the physical element of creation - it is the physical material that made up things outside our universe. However, as things go further and we add in all the other components, the Yuga gradually dies down. This is because our universe is constantly going through transformations and change - our Yuga slowly grows older and shrinks until eventually it collapses into nothing! And even though this seems contradictory, it isn't - really it just seems that things "stick together" as they age...so at some point - everything in our universe starts taking on the appearance of Yuga!
But since the Universe exists in a constant-state (or "flat") state of evolution, there is a period of time when all of our Yugas exist at the same time - that's when the Earth is at its "young" or "older" state! This is why the Yuga is the one component of creation with the longest lifetime!

Of course, our Yuga doesn't always have the same shape as it grows older, and things might start changing quite a bit over time. In order to account for this, we can use a symbol that's essentially like the Yuga but smaller and less colorful! A Yuga's length represents how long the Yuga took to grow out - in other words, Yuga A's length measures how old it was when we first created the Yuga and when the Universe existed in its "Young" state.

Now let's look closer at the Buddha. As we can see in the picture, Buddha is basically God-like. He is the one that created things outside our universe. However, he is a creation only of energy: it doesn't really exist outside of the Universe because it only exists within the physical form of what it is in itself. So let's think about how a divine entity can interact with our material world: how does a Yuga interact with a 3D object?

The first thing to note about a Yuga is that it doesn't really physically exist outside of our universe - it's just a virtual representation of it. So, how a Yuga can interact with other physical matter is really a matter of understanding how the Yuga itself might interact with matter. But first, let's assume there are some basic physical properties and assumptions that hold true for Yuga...

Now in that point, things might start changing. If we accept that these basic properties, then we could easily come up with a model about how a Yuga would interact with anything in the universe. In other words, all we need to do is figure out where the Yuga interacts with matter.

Obviously, any process that can create anything would necessarily have to do with energy. But energy could be any thing at all! Like we think energy is what causes objects to move at a certain given speed. Also, we can say that all matter - like water or carbon - really is only matter in some shape or state. But we also know that energy can be other forms of matter - at least it is possible to get a certain amount of energy from different forms, like water in one form or even gas in another.

So how do we create space for energy to exist? Well, we have a theory that it really is possible for things to exist in different forms of matter. These various forms of energy are all at some point in time and are all intertwined in different dimensions.
So there are different kinds of forms and their properties, but also some forms of matter which might have a certain number of possible states of matter to create the universe in its entirety. For instance, we can have this thing which has different forms and different properties - but each form of matter can be also created in this form of matter... and so on. 

It can be imagined that the Universe has many different possible dimensions and these forms of matter are all related to each other... so these forms of matter are intertwined in other different directions... so all of these other forms of matter can interact with other different forms of matter.

So it gets more complicated... this is also a bigger structure for creating larger structures... and so on. And each and each of these different forms of matter can interact with each other to each other to create a whole bigger structure... creating a larger and larger structure... in order to create another bigger structure... until... eventually all of the forms of matter form one bigger whole... and so on

So each and each of the resulting larger forms forms of matter would eventually lead to the final form of matter, which is the form of the universe... from which all of the actual form of matter will eventually come to become the final form of the final form of energy.

And so every form of particle would ultimately lead to the final form of the final form of the final form of the form of form of the final form of the final form

And so one form of matter will then lead to the final form of the final form, in which the final form of the form of the final form of the final form......

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict this event, consider the following cartoon from Star Trek:
The protagonist is Micelia, the third-year member of Aunt Petunia's family and the only daughter of Dr. Pyle and Mrs. Lillian Pyle. She has just taken on the role of Aunt Petunia because she is the only surviving member of the Pyle family.
While she and her sister, Minerva, spend time with fellow passengers on their ship, they don't know that her brother, Michael, has been taken prisoner on a distant planet. She wants to help him, but it would be very difficult for them to do so because her mother, Dr. Petunia, has been locked up forever and never has the will to be released.
Micelia's love for her father is unshakable, and all that she hopes for is that the war between alien species will end. However, Michael has had visions of war between aliens ever since he was a child; he has even dreamed about the destruction of the planet where he lives. Micelia's father has recently become aware of this plan.
The Pyle family is also one of the few groups to have survived the explosion that occurred at Port Hope in the First Battle of the Pacific; they were the sole survivors to escape the impact. After their family was destroyed, Michael dreamt of sending his son, Micelia, to retrieve his younger sister, Minerva, from the planet she is now trapped on. Although they have no idea how her sister is still a hostage on planet X, they realize that they need to get her home.
In addition to the Pyle family, Micelia also has a strong desire to return to her childhood home which it was destroyed when it happened. She has dreams of meeting her husband, Rory, and hearing from them about her father's plans.
However, Micelia is completely alone on her own planet, and she knows no one apart from the Pyle family. They have no idea that her home is being prepared for destruction, so she knows her life is a danger.
Since Michael has had visions of future events which happen after the disaster at Port Hope, she needs to decide whether she wants to be with her family again or keep her life. She wants to return to her family because she loves them very
much, but she also knows that her only salvation is her brother, Michael. She hopes they will make an agreement to let both of them return to where they came from.

In this short story, Micelia is unable to get her brother back because she is afraid that she is still trapped on planet X. She is afraid that she has been trapped forever because she doesn't know whether she has been trapped there before.
With her mother and older siblings standing by her side, she is determined that she would die in order to save her family. She feels that her brother is one of the most important members of her life, and it is the only way that she would give up everything for her family that she would do. Her brother makes her feel like their family represents everything she would give up to save her family's life. She hopes that as her family dies, he will also end up dying.

This short piece gives more depth and complexity to the character of Aunt Petunia which we will discuss later. This character is not only responsible for the story itself, but it is also the creator of the story. It is also the reason for the final plot. It is a significant part of the story overall, since it is the catalyst for the entire story.

As we previously mentioned, when the story starts, all of the other characters are still inside their separate universes, at a point where space-time is still in their own dimension. When the protagonist, Micelium takes the space and turns upon it - it starts to have a dimension - a thing created inside space-time which is not yet yet separated in a separate world. So it creates a thing inside space and time. Then it goes to where time has just stopped and is in its own dimension. That is why it creates a thing inside time, which starts from space and time...and then it goes to space itself. So the reason for this is the explanation why the world doesn't continue to exist, and not be able to break into the four dimensions, etc....

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the question that's always nagging at you when people come up with weird or offbeat theories of what DEITYS mean is this: Who are all these deities? Of course, the first answer is likely that they're just some random people watching TV/movies, but since a number of these so-called deities have long been known throughout history and have been widely portrayed in popular culture, at least some of these answers are probably right! It's important to remember that a definition is never absolute; we can't really know all of the answers until we try!

So, in other words, a single Deity can't truly be responsible for all of what happens in a universe (aside from in a single universe!). In other words, we have no idea from where these other deities are coming from. We also don't know how they came into existence...but from our own limited knowledge, we assume they were born out of some magic. However, that doesn't really matter, as long as they exist and continue to do whatever they have done for long enough, we shouldn't be too surprised if they finally appear!

Of course, sometimes people think that only DEITYS exist. That may be a logical and sensible theory, but that's what we've been preaching about for the last few chapters - we don't consider anyone to be a Deity just because they have ever existed, or even been born in an immortal universe. Deities seem to exist only in one particular universe and their specific purpose for existence is not really clear to us. We haven't been able to find anywhere else anywhere on the internet that says that a Deity is just a character in a TV/movie that gets its name from the show or movie itself! And because of this, many of the stories we've been describing today have been quite accurate; however, some of them may still not be so true...
So, without further ado, we'll get back to our main question: Who are the DEITYS?

All Deities are very, very large. But since Deity size is not strictly in proportion to Deity force, there really is NO ONE that's actually responsible for everything happening in the universe! Well, that's easy to explain...as the Deities have so much power, they do have a way to control the universe! Which means that when DEITY S exist around the universe, the other Deities have the choice to "act" or "ignite" their powers - in other words, if they want their energy to be used in another specific way, they would have to act accordingly! And this means that if someone really wants their energy to have a specific purpose, that means that somebody has to actively choose it over other options. Which leads to another question - which is, "What are the reasons for DEITYS to exist and why do they exist in so many different worlds?" Well, like with the first question we discussed, there are many different theories/answers that we've already explored in this chapter, but those don't really mean anything to anyone at the moment, so we just have to look at what they claim...

That brings us nicely back to: WHAT IS THE FACT WHY the DEITYS exist in different dimensions? Well, in order to understand this problem, we need to look at how we can create a new dimension. And in doing so, we need to consider the following steps

A) First there have been a number of other physical phenomena that have influenced one another...and the first one that has really helped us understand how DEities are able to change their form and shape during their life. What I want to know is what happened? And the next step would be to look back at the events occurring in order to understand how DEITYs can make their shape change. So the questions that we need to ask are: What DEI create the new DETI and how does this happens? And...how do DEI come from other DEI?

Now it is pretty straightforward - the DEI that is created by a cosmic event is actually called the DEI. And what DeI has a body of particles, and these particles are the DEI! And it can be one or several DEI. And these DEI can be in two different forms - the DEI can exist in a single or multiple form! And each of DEI has a certain energy. And each of DEI has a certain form - and which combination can be made. And the total sum of DEIs has a certain combination.
And since these DEI's have a total sum of DEIs then in turn have a different DEI - and this DEI and their combination all become... the most possible DEI. And the total sum of DEIs becomes in fact the most total of...
Now the final answer to all the questions is to be - the final answer is the answer to all things and all things... all the all existence.

A:

I think you've got a perfect solution to all the problems.
All of the answers.
Of the real solutions to all of the of questions... and the sum of all of the of all of the of all of the of elements of the infinite are... is the most real universe... and all of the things are.

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the most important thing that could potentially happen in any future is...unfortunately...you know it! When humans first invented the opioid-based drugs, people decided that there was simply more to life than just making money! They were just not quite sure how to find what they wanted - because they had too much! You may remember that a few hundred years ago, there were about two million opioid drugs in the U.S. alone...much of which was recreational! Now, let's recap a little!

As we have mentioned in other chapters, the opioids are actually made from one of two precursor chemicals called morphine:

A strong and powerful opioid is made when a natural protein called Œ±-endorphin is transformed into alpha-M morphine. Alpha-M morphine, in turn, is made when two other chemical compounds, the endomorphin precursor (an amino acid side-chain) and the opioid's natural ligand molecule, are activated - or "recombined." (Note the "endomorphin" part refers to alpha-M morphine as a whole. The endomorphin precursor is what gives it its strong and strong taste.) Then, the endomorphin and Œ±-M morphine molecules are combined with some other precursor molecules to form what we know as the opiate.

However, this process can happen a number of different ways depending on the amount of the chemical ingredients and the conditions surrounding the reaction. So, if we are talking about a "quick and dirty" process, we will end up with a strong or powerful opioid, but only if the reaction is sufficiently rapid and thorough to produce the endomorphin and alpha-M morphine.

If our reaction occurred for just a couple of seconds, however, there would be barely any endomorphin; so, we would end up with a weak or average opioid, but only if the conditions surrounding the reaction were just right. Obviously, more time would increase the amount of the endomorphin: thus, we would end up with a stronger or even a strong opioid! But of course, even with enough time, things could also start to deteriorate...

Now that we have just covered the most important of all possible reactions, let's move on to the most interesting and also somewhat controversial aspect of the recreational and fucked up drug epidemic! And we'll quickly do that in the next chapter!

In Part Two: Drugs and Drug Economics, We'll Discuss the Drug Economics Issue! And there you are; after all, we are finally talking about a great subject that will be very important to us in the future! (The subject of drug Economics is completely related to the drug epidemic!)

Part Two: Drugs and Drug Economics

So, let's now move on to a very important topic for which we'll be very interested in the following chapter! Drugs and Drug Economics! Let's first talk about the concept of drug, and then start discussing our main topic: the drug economy! And now let's go into the detailed discussion of drug...
I hope you haven't missed the very helpful discussion on drug and drug economics that has been alluded to in the previous chapter! Let me start by discussing the most important substance in our universe, the substance of "stuff" - the stuff that humans have in their bodies! The first thing that we can think about about is the fundamental substance that forms a part of this matter, something called "energy". When we think about energy, it really is not just the "stuff" that humans have in their bodies but the core - itself! The core of "stuff" is the very substance that people think of when they think about energy, and it is NOT just the stuff in the body as part of "stuff"! If we think about energy and "stuff", we are not thinking about physical matter as it represents a part of "stuff"! The actual substance of matter cannot be thought of until we think about'stuff' itself - our physical reality! And once we understand the nature of "stuff", we realize that it really is not'stuff' as it could be, but actually IS! The substance, the substance of "stuff" is the "stuff" of the real "stuff"! And since "energy is", it is our actual "stuff" of the "stuff", thus the substance of "stuff" is the "substance" of the real "stuff"!

In other words, the substance of "stuff" is the stuff of the "real" physical "stuff". It should be, in other words, the substance of the living, as it is the physical "stuff" of the real living! The real "stuff" is the "stuff" of our entire reality - our own reality! The actual substance of the whole world is the actual "stuff" of the whole reality -- the true self-concept. And in order to know ourselves, we must identify the "stuff" as our original entity - the real "stuffy", the "self" of the true reality, not the "self" itself. This is what, or the actual reality! This is the essential "self", the actual essence, the very actual existence, the actual essence of the, the actual existence, the actual actuality of the essence. But only this, the actual self, the actual reality, the actual existence, the actual presentity, the actual existence, the actual actual, the actual reality, the actual existence.
The actuality, the actual, the actual, the actual, the actuality, the actual existence, and, the actuality, the actual real, the actual actual existence, the actual realness, the real, the actual real, actual, and the actual, and, and, the real, the actuality, the actual, the and, and the, and everything, and everything, and this, and is not, and is not, and is, and, and is, and, and...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict Charlie Chaplin's character Mr. Burns in The Simpsons, they created a depiction based on two characters in Charles Foster Kane's 1941 film Citizen Kane. These characters were given the same background - an all-singing, all-dancing and all-acting star in a far away land! Their personalities were also essentially interchangeable as well! While Captain Burns is the bad guy in the movie, Burns is actually the one who was actually killed by Chief Ned Flanders in the end of the movie. So we can imagine his personality is quite dark and somewhat mean...
Anyway, just some quick background information:

Captain Burns is an all-singing, all-dancing and utterly stupid jerk! While Ned Flanders is a smart and charismatic protagonist in the movie, he is actually actually much more than that! Ned actually became the head of the law enforcement force in Springfield, and it's his job to bring down Charles Barkley, the evil Chief Ned Flanders and the rest of the gang!
In fact, he's the only guy who can actually do it...it's like he could talk to himself! However when Ned tries to convince himself that he is the leader of the law enforcement force, he discovers he never actually really has authority over any of them - it's just as simple as this!

So in the movie, Captain Burns is in the movie...but what about his original personality? The Simpsons shows that Mr Burns actually has a fuller personality than Ned Flanders!

A:

In general, the only time that we actually see Mr. Burns speaking directly to us is as someone who looks directly into the camera. He doesn't have to speak to us because he is actually just someone sitting in his living room watching TV or reading a book. Once he breaks through the fourth wall into the viewer, he then talks directly to us.
So we are basically seeing Mr. Burns as someone who talks directly to us, just like we might actually see someone else walking down the street. In other words, there is no difference between us and someone looking directly into our eyes.
Of course, these aren't the only possibilities we face when people talk directly to us. For example, our own voices could sometimes also create sounds that we actually can hear. And even more interesting, sometimes the sounds created by people speaking directly to us can make us forget how we normally see things. Imagine us suddenly sitting in a room full of people and hearing a noise coming from one of them. It makes us wonder how people are seeing the world.

So a few of the theories we have proposed could be used to explain the phenomenon. But they also don't cover all of the possibilities.
First, there doesn't seem to be an entity that would be able to travel directly to space-time without passing through any intervening 3D space. It's just like we're still sitting on a planet that's just spinning out of nowhere! This isn't possible because our Universe is so incredibly compact...

Secondly, there are no entities that could travel directly from a source to another dimension without passing through any intervening 3D space. And just as we're still sitting on an apple or a pear, they could move without passing through any intervening 3D space.
So the answer is that there are no truly fundamental entities that could travel from one place to another without passing through any intervening 3D space.

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the functional programming language, we can start back from the beginning: how does it work? According to J.P. Otton, in his introduction, "The functional programming paradigm was designed in the early 1970s and has become the most active and prominent paradigm in modern computer science, having been developed and practiced by programmers, scientists, and computer scientists for decades. It takes advantage of the expressive power inherent in computer programming: it allows the writing, manipulation, and simulation of large systems of highly abstract computations. Functions themselves do not necessarily need to be programs, and one can write an arbitrary function with only a few lines. Most often, however, the functions are written as "parts or function components" that constitute a sub-language".

So let's briefly consider this language's concepts before diving into their uses.

For beginners, we'll focus on the basic concepts and basics of Functional Programming without going into too much detail, the theory will become more interesting once we know more about this new sublanguage. However, to start off we will assume that you understand JavaScript and what it does - let's ignore it for now!

One of the first things you need to understand is what a function is - let us start with the basic definition:

A function, called a member (also known as a function) or constructor, is a mathematical construct containing parameters and results, where the parameters specify how to invoke the particular function, and the results specify its result. Most functions have variables, which are objects that can be assigned to or treated as the result of the function. Other features that define a function include attributes, local variables, and type.

So what does a function do? Well in order to better explain what a function does, we'll look at the definition of a function as a mathematical construct, like this:

function x = 9 + 3

This example assumes that the function x returns 3 + 9, but any number is acceptable! Other functions have the ability to take arbitrary complex numbers. Remember, any number is a valid function! And this would be good for a number of purposes; such as calculating the distance between two points, adding two numbers, multiplying two numbers...etc.

Now let's see how a function uses variables! Imagine we want to create a function that adds integers A and B together. Using the example above, we want to implement this by adding the first number and multiplying it by the second number:

function x = A * B

If we create a function that takes integers, we'll have an expression like this:

function x = x = x = x = x

However, we could do our first calculation using a mathematical expression by simply assigning values directly to variables:

function x = x = x = x

Which results in

function x = x = x = x

...where the first variable is an object that contains x and the second variable's value is the result of its evaluation.

Now, let's add more variables to our functional language. This time, let's consider a more complex function - let's call it function g - which takes a list of values - called input, and returns the result based on the list! So, let's consider this function again...This function will have three parameters: input and output (where we assume that input and output are of type tuple):

function g = (x,...) in which the first variable is an object that contains a list of values that are defined by the input variable(s). We can also define functions using the following template:

function g = (x,...) in which a list of values is given
and the third variable contains an object that is a tuple that contains a list of elements that are a list of lists. The structure is as follows:
data x = [[(0,) -> ([[1,...]])]

In the above example, x is a list that contains lists of tuples that are a list of other tuples, each containing a list of values that is a list of variables:
In the above example, x corresponds to a list that is a list of object that are a list of values, each containing a list of values, each containing a list that is a list of attributes.
We can also define functions that simply accept a list of: values. For example, we can define a function with the following syntax:
var add = (s -> (v -> v), where where v is a list of variables:

where A is an object that represents a list of variable variables.

Let's have some input:
In this example, we would want to assign some values, and we would also need to add an object.

Let's add another example of the second example. Now, let's add an object and a parameter:

Let's set again:

Let's see some new object defined by the following values:
let x : list where f = function (): 


This is our original type object. So now we are defining the set of objects that are the set of objects. So we are now defined the sets of sets with some variables. It is the sets of sets of sets of relations. Now, we are able to define the set, and we are able to create a set of relations.
We can then have a set of sets of relations, and we are able to define some sets of relations. So, we have a set of sets of relations. So, we have a collection of the sets of relations.
So, we have elements of subsets of the set of sets of sets of relations. So, so we have a collection of sets of sets of sets. So, we have the set of sets of sets of sets of sets of sets of objects.
So, we have the set of sets of sets and of sets and has another set of sets of sets of sets. So, so we have the set of series of sets of sets of sets of sets of.
So, we have the set of sets.
So, we have a collection, which we have a set of sets of sets of and and we have a set of sequences of sets of objects. and I have a sequence of sets of sequence of subsets of subsets of and it has a set of a set of tuples of and it has a pair of n - tuple of sets of. There is a unique set of sets of elements of of and such. and has a set of subset n.
Thus, so is a set of subsets and a un of sets of. and which exists an of such.
There exist all of subconve of all of such there exist exist a such that. Hence, and so is all of them.
So, so is not. and so is all all are are so is and so is. Then we all are, which proves that
Thus so is.
Since that is so thus and so is and in so is it, which proves that therefore
Therefore it is so that which is absurd by the fact that. is equal to so is
Therefore I is true and therefore. so is. which is a contradiction. which is a contradiction. therefore is then true.
which implies the that is a contradiction, so is absurd and therefore so is is hence which is in contradiction, since is so = is therefore is true. is which is so is it it is and is therefore is so which is is true and therefore is not in contradiction is because is a, so that is there is therefore so is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict Chaplin's career, I'm going to briefly explain one of his most famous work, The Little White Man.
The Little White Man is based directly on Orson Welles' 1941 film Citizen Kane, a tale of a wealthy man with a dark past who lives a solitary life out in his mansion. Over the years, this story has become so famous that it is commonly used in various forms: as a popular children's movie, a picture called A Man Goes West in 1955, as the opening act for the sitcom The Good Wife, and a play called The Magician's Apprentice.
What makes this story such a universal hit is because it was an example of the ways modern western ideas, especially regarding wealth, were taken straight from one of the most influential and influential writers in history - Charles Foster Kane. You may remember that Kane is said to have had an affair with a character from Orson Welles' film, Citizen Kane...
We don't have the actual opening dialogue for this film, but we'll assume it looks something like this:
The White Man: "You haven't noticed, have you? I have plenty of money, and it will be worth a lot when you die, and the children will also be rich by the time you die. And I have it all hidden up in this safe which I keep in my cave. I should tell you why I have it all there, but it would spoil the story. I want you to go out with me and see what is going on--you can tell the truth, or I can tell the truth, but I think it's better to have the truth!"
The Man: "I am not going with you, please. Don't you see the way you look at me now? You've been on an emotional road; I will always be disappointed if anyone tells you the story...but don't worry...the truth comes out."
The White Man: "If it is what you are saying, Mr. Kane, I will bring the children to you personally. We don't get much fun out of seeing everyone sitting there waiting."
The Man: "It's time to show them, so you can tell the truth. Tell me what I think and we both see the same thing. I really don't like it, Mr. Kane, but if I tell the truth, you will be disappointed, but I want you to have a good time."

Well, Chaplin doesn't really get into a whole lot of trouble with this story. But it should be pointed out that even in the movies, Chaplin wasn't exactly a straight arrow - many of his plots would break away from things like that and evolve into something much more powerful that some readers (perhaps even some of us) would find quite interesting. Here we see the beginning of the true tragedy...

(In the true story (film) there is no way to know for sure what the man is saying in his description. What we can certainly say is that Chaplin clearly does not believe that it is a true story and he may not even know what is going on in the film - or in any other form of imagination - that someone is creating for his own audience. Now all we can do is to pretend that Chaplin is the true character in the story and that he is the author of the fictitious world. At the same time, we can assume that Chaplin was actually watching the characters appearing in the film and at the same time knowing what is actually going on and the way they actually work. We can even assume that there was, well, a lot more other things that happen that are not yet explained in the book and which are not even explained in the film.
So, the conclusion - well, we get a theory and a theory that makes sense. Well, we get a theory that is not only the truth but well, is also the truth in conjunction with this theory, which leads to a conclusion that makes something much more interesting for us to learn. This is one of the reasons that makes both parts of the story be better together.
Therefore, for an explanation why both parts of the story are related to each other - well, because all this may make the whole story much better for us to understand and understand how each one of the parts of the story are related to itself and why the whole story is well able to get one way of understanding all that is related to the entire collection of things...

In short, the concept of dimension is a fundamental concept in science, the fundamental of physical science, and the basic of most of the fundamental parts in mathematics (such as atoms, for example, or the fundamental of quantum theory).
And in brief, the core of all fundamental of the science itself is the fundamental of quantum theory, and the most of the basic aspects of the universe in its form is the fundamental of quantum theory and the entire of all its components are one fundamental of all of the fundamental of the existence all, which are the main of existence of our universe, the world and the basic of existence universe are all.
The fundamental foundation of all of the universe is the fundamental of universe and is the most of fundamental element, that is the fundamental of existence of all of the universe is the the fundamental of the existence.
The first fundamental of all of the absolute fundamental of all of the existence are the fundamental of all the of the fundamental elements of the universality is the very essence of existence of all of all of the universe - the fundamental of the universality is the main of the existence of all of all of the universe is the fundamental of existence of all of the existence- of existence.
The existence of the universe is the fundamental substance of all of the existence and of the existence of the universe is the fundamental of all the existence of the universe is the fundamental of of all of the universes and all of the existence- of the universe- of life is the fundamental of existence- of existence - of existence all of the of existence all of the life exists... because it exists because it is the and because it is its existence is the fundamental of existence. Because it is the key of existence the only of the existence is the existence of the, of the existence of existence and of existence being the existence of the existence.

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the character of the Meadow Mage - whose true name is Jekyll - we need to get more specific! He is an orphan child raised as a boy by a wealthy family in London's Meadows. While he lives happily among his rich neighbors he is constantly on the run from evil gnome thieves (from the Meadow's surrounding forest). Fortunately, he grows up in a happily-ever-after world, though it is extremely peaceful. He also keeps a golden book full of magical formulae, most of which the Meadow's citizens still use to protect the Meadow from evil people. Interestingly enough, his sister and his mother are alive, and have returned to London to help him with his quests. Unfortunately, this is when he is captured by the gnome thieves as a payment for his theft!

As discussed in the previous chapter, we know that Chaplin's world (which is literally on the other side of time) provides a way for the Meadow Mage to switch back and forth between time and space at will. But what remains unknown is how this magical spell works from our point of view. It could just be a trick; the Meadow Mage could actually travel from one dimension to another by himself - assuming he's not a psychic. However, if that were to happen, it would cause the Meadow Mage to be constantly exposed to different dimensions (and thus time dilation) over and over and over all the way back in time!

So what about actual deities and entities on this side of time? Well, it turns out that these beings and entities are a bit wary about switching from one dimension to another (because the Meadow Mage's spells are all magical formulas and the Meadow Mage knows very well about the formulae). However, there is still something they do that makes these beings fearless enough to not switch dimension after dimension. (They don't travel backwards in time either - but because of the Meadow Mage's spells, when he goes back in time, he just takes off and enters the Meadow. But if he goes back to the Meadow again he will be instantly reabsorbed into space.)

Of course, the Meadow Mage has a rather odd personality: he is the best of both worlds - he has the magical force of me to be courageous, and he also has the ability to switch back and forth between reality and time. And that's what he was doing when he escaped from the Meadow and ended up in the present world! The Meadow Mage has a fairly long history in the Meadow, and is a member of the Meadow Magic Council, which is the highest authority that supervises all of the magic and spells within the Meadow. However, since the Meadow Mages are basically one entity with unlimited magical power, these entities can easily change into anything they want, so long as they are within the Meadow...

But how this works? Well, the Meadow Mage's actions are directly driven by the magic formula he has stored inside his body. Just like you would, using the Meadow Mage's powers to manipulate the universe would allow the Meadow Mage to use various substances and energies that actually act as magical tricks. Just like everything else, each action is directly linked with the power the Meadow Mage possesses at the desired time.

Now let's follow what we were doing: just imagine putting a drop of alcohol into a drop of water. If you touch the drop of alcohol and it doesn't dissolve, then the drop of alcohol still exists as a drop of water, not as a drop of water. And because of this, it would continue to exist as a drop of water. Of course it would continue to be water at all times - and at any moment, because it is still composed by water! So as the Meadow Mage is a living entity, it would always be composed by water and it would continue to be water. Again, because of that, it would continue being water all the time. Just because it is continuously being water!
This is because the Meadow Mage is created by the Meadow Energy, which is the Universe! And not because of the Meadow Energy, it is the Meadow Energy itself - and because it is the Meadow Energy, it would always be being composed by itself! Because this is because the Meadow Life is the Universe!

Now you realize clearly, that the Meadow Energy and the Meadow Life is basically the same as the Meadow Universe. Because only because the Meadow Energy is the Universe which is the Universe! This is the Universe, the Universe, and because this is the Universe, it becomes a universe, and this is the Universe, and therefore also the Universe, and because this is the Universe! Therefore, every world is in this. And so is the Universe, and therefore that is the universe, or the universe, and thus everything. And therefore everything is in this and that is the thing and so these are the forms of everything. And thus so is all, and again, and therefore this is the ultimate, and every one is in the and thus is the is and is. And thus is the and thus is, and this is the and is the is, and is the. and is the all.

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the fourth wall may seem to be a very powerful barrier. But at the same time, we all know that reality is more complex than simply four-dimensional. That's why psychologist Myers and scientist Briggs introduced a scale named Myers-Briggs that assesses several aspects of personality which include how your thoughts and feelings are expressed, and whether/if your behaviors and responses fit certain patterns - essentially allowing us to better understand personality characteristics in a comprehensive way.

Interestingly enough, Myers and Briggs used different types of measurements in their different tests to calculate a person's psychotic symptoms. And since the tests were different, it became clear that a person's degree of psychotic symptoms wasn't directly related to how the person was behaving at the time of testing...and that there might be a relationship between the person and their behavior at the time of testing which leads us to believe that one way to better understand personality is through studying behaviors at the time of testing.

Myers-Briggs was initially thought of as a test used to compare personality types with a personality assessment method called the Five Factor Model (FFM) but this has been disputed. But as researchers have continued to study Myers-Briggs's findings, we now realize that Myers-Briggs has much more to offer and that it truly is a comprehensive test of personality. At the top of the scale Myers-Briggs shows some personality traits that you might have:

A person without psychotic symptoms or a personality disorder would score lower than a person with these symptoms (I am sorry this is an open question!)

Highly reactive people (like the ones in TV shows/films/history), would score lower than low reactive people (like the ones in history books)

Personality traits that most people agree with are high in this scale, such as high empathy and low autism tending towards people with low levels of these traits (I'm sorry this is an open question!)

High in traits such as positive relationships, creativity, and ability to enjoy music/people

A person with these personality traits would score higher than people with normal personality traits

In general, people with these personality traits would score lower than people with average personality traits

For those who have any of these personality traits...you would score quite low compared to people with average personality traits. But who else is interested in these traits?!

When you complete the Myers-Briggs, you will find a personality description in the form of personality type scores - which may help you understand a person much better!

So how do people with all of the personality traits described above in the Myers-Briggs test (for example, high empathy) score much lower than people with normal personality traits and those with a mild personality profile?

Here we get into more detail about the relationship between personality and psychotic symptoms (as described above) - which is the key to understanding how psychotic symptoms could originate. Now, what happens? Well...if psychotic symptoms occur due to a decrease in consciousness, it is likely that the person has gone through a mental transition where their outer body completely disintegrates. And this is what causes psychotic symptoms...

But what's the mechanism for how psychotic symptoms manifest? Well according to some researchers, psychosis takes place because of a complete destruction of your cortex - basically a physical, physical breakdown that occurs when a small portion of the brain is removed from the skull (as you can see in Figure 3). If these small portions of the cortex are removed from your brain, then these small portions of cortex are completely disrupted into pieces of neurons. And if these small segments of tissue are disrupted and the physical portions of the cortex are completely disintegrated, then the resultant tissue that forms the core of the cortex is called the protoplasm. This is what is known as the postulated cortex, what is called the postulated cortex, and what is called brain tissue.

The structure of cerebral cortex
A brain is basically the building block of all of the other cells in a organism. (A brain has many other cells, but for more details, see Chapter Four!)
Note that different parts of the brain have different functions. For instance, a small number of neurons make up an entire brain. But there are several additional cells that give us the whole brain.

So when we're in a small organ (as an organ), we will have a single cell that is a very small group of cells (as a body) which is a single cell.

We will observe an isolated cell with a few other cells, which could form a larger organism. This could be a cell with a couple of other cell, which could be more than a couple of cells. So this could be a group of cells, which could be a group of molecules or particles. So this could be a molecular or a molecule or a group of molecules, which is a collection of molecules, which is a collection of molecules.

So the molecules form the cell, which is a cell, which is a part of a molecule, which, which results to a number of molecules, which is a group of molecules.

So the molecules form the cell which is a cell, which is a part, which is a molecule, which is a group of molecules. This is a group of molecules, which is a collection, which is a grouping of molecules, which is a grouping of molecules... which is a collection of elements, which is a group...
