 Of course, this comes with some caveats though, as there are no laws of physics that govern the behaviour of such beings - it's up to the creator of each dimension to decide how they interact with other dimensions!

A:

In my view, one of the most important elements of the theory of relativity is the equivalence principle.  The equivalence principle states that the laws of physics are not affected by the relative speed of particles, even when the speed of the particles is infinite.
The equivalence principle is an important principle in physics, because it allows us to make the following predictions:

If two objects are separated by a distance which is infinite in both space and time, then they will collide at the same time.
If two objects are separated by a distance which is infinite in both space and time, then they will collide at the same time.

In other words, if you and I are separated by a distance which is infinite in both space and time, then we will collide at the same time.

One of the most important implications of the equivalence principle is that the laws of physics are not affected by the relative speed of particles.  It is easy to imagine situations where the speed of a particle is infinite and the laws of physics are still valid, such as if a particle is in the vacuum state and travels infinitely fast.  But if the speed of a particle is infinite, but the laws of physics are still valid, then it is not easy to imagine situations where the laws of physics are still valid.  For example, if a particle in the vacuum state travels infinitely fast, it is impossible for it to collide with another particle.  However, if the laws of physics are still valid, then it is still possible for two particles to collide at the same time.

In other words, if you and I are separated by a distance which is infinite in both space and time, then we will collide at the same time.

But what about other situations where the speed of a particle is finite?  For example, if you and I are separated by a distance which is finite in both space and time, then we will collide at the same time.

However, there are some situations where the speed of a particle is finite, but the laws of physics still hold.  In these cases, the laws of physics still apply, but the speed of the particle is not infinite.  For example, if you and I are separated by a distance which is finite in both space and time, but the laws of physics still hold, then it is still possible for two particles to collide at the same time.

If you take a slice through the 4D space-time graph, you can see that the particle is moving in the x, y, z, and t dimensions and is moving towards the origin. The x, y, z, and t dimensions are the dimensions that you can see from a perspective of your body, but the origin is the dimension that you cannot see from a perspective of your body, because it is the origin of time. When the particle enters the x, y, z, and t dimensions, it will experience acceleration, so it will become more and more curved and accelerate towards the origin. As the particle enters the x, y, z, and t dimensions, the speed of the particle will decrease and the laws of physics will not apply, so it will not collide with another object.
If you take a slice through the 3+1 space-time graph, you can see that the particle is moving in the x, y, z dimensions and is moving towards the origin. The x, y, z dimensions are the dimensions that you can see from a perspective of your body, but the origin is the dimension that you cannot see from a perspective of your body, because it is the origin of time. When the particle enters the x, y, z dimensions, it will experience acceleration, so it will become more and more curved and accelerate towards the origin. As the particle enters the x, y, z dimensions, the speed of the particle will decrease and the laws of physics will not apply, so it will not collide with another object.
