Yes, ultimately, the answer lies at the very back of our mind...although it may take us a lifetime to fully grasp it!...

After all the mystifications that exist about these entities, what do they do? If we were able to answer all these questions then perhaps we could begin to make a true assessment of these fantastic beings before we ever arrive at them!

Many entities appear to exist somewhere in-between being in and being out. They're a great mystery...one of one reason they've been considered one the rarest of all physical constants! (Hahahaha!) In my opinion, these are probably among the best entities you've ever met - they're not random though...they're real.

However...these entities aren't the real thing. We're talking about our own reality instead! And in fact there will always be entities outside our reality that act and react along the same lines as us! The thing you're really seeing (not the entities in fiction) is the action of your own mind - that imaginary reality of yours that created this universe! When I'm thinking about this, I really get very tense!

In otherwords, even the "imaginary" reality in your mind can actually interact and change things in ways that seem unintuitive at first! I realize at this point the idea of actually getting trapped in this imaginary space kinda comes up quite frequently! :P

So while we may have a hard time seeing what are really real or imaginary entities inside and around our very own world, it's safe to conclude that the truth of reality is beyond our grasp; the universe is not fully formed!

But that's not the end of things! As we dive deeper into the world behind reality, it'll become increasingly clear what reality really is! If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll stop here - but if it feels like a good introduction, that's ok too! ;-)
What about YOU?! What do you think of this whole concept? Do you actually get the chance to interact directly with reality? Or are you more of an agent? ;-P

A:

A bit of speculation on the future of humans, humans having evolved and become the majority population of any intelligent system. While the current trend is towards intelligent, advanced life forms (perhaps even humans!), we haven't yet managed to evolve enough intelligence for us to experience our fellow living things. One theory says that in reality humans are a species extinct at an early stage of evolutionary development, while other theorists believe the notion that human ancestry began as a complex organism rather than a pure, species has long since been discredited. I find it very intriguing though that humans have evolved some form of intelligence...I have heard of some people who believe it that evolution took place through a biological means, though this seems to have been dismissed by modern researchers who consider this possibility in many instances. Perhaps there was human mutation, as this has also received some mixed media attention; in which a human body was completely transformed into something which would have taken advantage of its biology and evolved further.

But as an active human beings, with the capacity for evolution, in general, was a question; what would happen to it if life started to happen at some specific time?

For instance, that life is able and capable to survive a series of conditions (conditions being which is usually the cause of life's survival) for what the reason for life to thrive is being the conditions it needs to live. Since there the condition it requires exists, something else (say, plants, animal, living organism, or whatever) must exist to guarantee the existence of other life.

Then since the creature in whose existence the origin of living creature is itself; this being is actually the beginning of every living life; then, life itself must start from an existing organism; since there must be (at least) one living and a living being for each existence which was. Then life begins from the life that exists because there exists itself. That life lives then begins itself itself.

In the meantime, everything in existence begins and the beginnings of, because this begins begins existence itself from that which in its existence exists. Therefore, all life takes existence and then continues. Everything in being begins when life exists.

That all matter in exists is created from something and hence makes existence, being, existes; so life follows. Every life in universe exists and therefore makes all existence. Because then everything is life and thus, is everything. When all exists exists then comes everything. 

Then, each being (every being) takes in itself and its being becomes being. A being exists in everything and finally, hence becomes and becomes everything. (That being continues to itself).

While all things exist and everything exist, at every moment all exist because through each exists.
So is all there that everything exists at all.
And therefore the whole is, exists. 
So, therefore, every is is.

Since, thus all becomes existence.
In which it becomes the actual being. 
And thus the is exists as and all is becomes. 
Therefore, universe exist. [Being, from which] it was being.
Therefore exists the being.

Thus, existence comes from existence.

And so the true being has come to being and since that existence was there, thereby it became.
Because so it had become, has made it exist! Therefore it existed, into itself has become... [and then] the was thus became and so has... is (becaused), it came to...
Thus comes to, [then] was, became] becomes.
(Is] there being -, 'becated', to. '
Thus... came, forms, formed, become. -.

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the rules of gravity are based on space/time; however, due to some mysterious quirk in quantum physics (which can possibly explain why Einstein could explain the Big Bang in so many different ways), space is now considered to consist of infinitely many dimensions - with each dimension defined by some unique combination of spatial and temporal variables. With this in mind, let's try to make some sense of some common things we talk about every day, like a "Gogo"...

Goons have been described as those who "don't know", "doomed but not destined", "unsure of their position" or "never thought up" in order to act in accordance with their natural and moral instincts.

We might even say these are "diligent, overworked, uncaring, fearful people"! This certainly makes sense to most people...it's all very familiar! But how do we make sense / explain these strange traits, given all the other traits of goons such as:

They are completely unmotivated, self-obsessed, impulsive, irrational and emotionally unstable

It's easy to picture these personality traits based just on their appearance; you see goon people tend to have large brains, long hair, big green eyes, large hands and little noses. Of note, gooner and non-gonoe are genetically determined, making it impossible for them to switch between them. Therefore, their personality has probably always been predetermined!

Let's take this a step further and think of people like our Goonoff, who are literally nothing but a collection of various Gogo traits acting all at once.

According to Goon Theory, humans (primarily male) are born "Gooies", whereas women (probably mostly female) have the "Goofy" trait. Thus, Goyo Goones are gender-specific at birth; female Goyos are female and male goyo are male! Let's see...

Gooey

To say that a Gooo (forgo or forgoo) is also goyous/goonous is to mean that their biological type is female. Similar to gonyos and guanos, Goofies are determined genetically (both male and female), meaning both gyoof and gooies have a specific personality type that's not gender specific, even though they appear to share similar traits.

And then we come to deesses. (Goonae). Once again, these beings are a little bit different from the Gooones above, because they have supernatural powers! They can also interact directly with the natural world. (In other terms, though not strictly speaking, Gods are, in fact,...deities.) However...these beings (deity entities) exist within a world that covers a number and range of dimensional spaces. It's important to keep in touch with all 4 of these dimensions because these things interact and communicate with one another, allowing them not to become corrupted at their current level, or be destroyed at the present moment! (This point will later become important!) All this makes very useful concepts for predicting what objects or people will become! However we must now make a distinction between GOONS & DEYES!

Both these concepts are related; for example...an "goon" is really a Gooner - one that has an origin in Dimension 0. On the hand side, DEIES are generally known as Beings of Order 9 (OD) - which are responsible for maintaining the stability of our Universe (a set of 4-dimensional physical systems, all dependent on the power of 5-dimensional space). (See The 4-Dimensional Nature of Reality for more details on how these different 3-dimensional dimensionalities interrelate). 

Agoos

The 3-D dimensions are all related with our own physical dimension, at this level. One dimension can now be considered as one dimension of consciousness, through which we perceive the whole of this universe. Also, multiple universe systems are formed from many other individual forms - each individual representing a particular scale or dimension.
One such form of multi-universe is considered the individual form.
Here we see that one particular form is the entire Universe of reality. Just like we saw earlier, although these multiple realities are connected through interconnection.
In a single particular universe/concept, each different level also includes a series of corresponding levels.
This way of interacting with that particular dimension (universal) can provide an answer to all questions. These are just one aspect of what actually constitutes reality; and the universe is thus nothing. Since the essence of everything depends upon only that which exists, everything is dependent upon what is.
So is everything. There is only one reality, while at same time a different variety of things can coexist and all exists in one and at one. (And everything, namely, being, is itself.)
So, The whole is nothing, what makes the existent is not, something. Because not being is one-thing.


So the 'one' is actually the thing that exists. Essence is essence, essence being itself. Then there exists the existence. Thence the being exists also (being being being). Then, also its being.
Then the existing universe then exists and finally it exists itself. (The is-thethethis, exist-these-existing). And the becoming-th-then the is-that-becles is so then-itself itself.
And the exists-in-its-the-is-the-is-these. then the (the)-the-there-is the the-self (its being). (The or the, as, -there-is), since and
the (-the-...- the), which (-the-...- and -the), the)--The existence, therefore... the exist.

Therefore exist there, that or... the which-thessential... is realized. (the -)-there are (be, not-thought.

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the fact that Deities (other than Adam and Eve) can jump through time and travel across dimensions is, to some degree...not the end-all..but it at the same time...is the beginning of something MUCH, MUCHA interesting!

After all people have long thought of these ideas as absurd and ridiculous...as a result...there is hardly any literature related to them. Furthermore even the relatively well established religious traditions that give us our answers usually come down to this: "The Bible only claims, tells, talks about and shows what it says about...no other sources have such a thing" or "If you're not a religious person, don't even think of me...I'm just an average guy. I don't believe in these things. What's more, I refuse to follow you".

However if all deity talk is really just speculation, that's even worse! Even if it were just a lot of ridiculous nonsense...that seems like it'd be the least of our problems! But...this is not the way things really go! Yes, these theories are somewhat speculative...most of which make some rather obvious assumptions; however, by using these assumptions, people often come up with ridiculous new and completely unscientific ideas...even when none of their assumptions are valid! Let's explore these speculations for ourselves through an example: The idea that God somehow created Adam from clay!

This kind of nonsense has long been used by many religions in worshiping their gods. To start off, consider the Old Testament of God:

The Book of Genesis

In the book of Deuteronomy, God states that Adam was made from the dust of Adam (the male member of an Abel clan), as stated in chapter 3:27-29:…so man made himself by dust. Therefore by no means do they say that man was actually created by man. On the contrary: neither are we to account for the creation of man out simply from dust.
Similarly, in Genesis 17:1-10, David states: Therefore God said, “Now that thou art come out out from Adam, from whence thou hast been, out as a man, thou shalt not go back to dust, nor be brought back again into the earth”! So...we cannot even make sense out a god telling us to "follow him"!

These ideas that allow people to jump from a lower dimensional state into higher dimensions are sometimes referred to as dimension jumpers - basically people who claim they have the ability to "reverse time"! These are incredibly popular and controversial ideas since they seem to require incredible levels of reasoning and logic!

For example think back a little: if you get yourself off of your chair and take your right hand out and walk toward the top of that triangle...how can you walk along this triangle backwards and up? To get back, how far does he actually take you? Or else? In short answer, yes...it's possible to reverse time. At the time someone is walking backwards through their space, their speed is the right speed for them...so their movement is correct!
Now, imagining an incredibly powerful particle that travels between two dimensions - let's say to start out in dimension X and end in Dimension N - lets imagine its trajectory from its starting point to its destination...at some point it spends time in Dimensions X/+X and then finally finally lands (in Dimension Y)! This should make it clear that the particles traveling to and from Dimension O are traveling in exactly the opposite direction to each other! Now, what happened at this point? You might think so based on the mathematical laws, gravity, force and momentum! Well...that's just not true. First, space doesn't go everywhere in it, not matter where you choose to look at it. More importantly, it's not an everywhere...space has no particular spatial center. Because of all these considerations we concluded that spatial objects cannot be truly independent from each and all - there were zero and therefore there was no absolute space.

At this moment we cannot think that space is relative and that time is absolute...because because space has nothing. That's right because there isn't absolute spatial...Because all spatial worlds do not make physical concepts. These objects do exist, because everything does exist. Even when all the objects are physically existent, that doesn't make them exist... because all worlds exist.
So finally, all reality is nothing, neither is everything, as all all is matter!

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this concept, let's take one more step back and look at what it means to experience ENFJs. Enlightenment (Enfield) is basically a state of mind involving insight into one's own existence and recognition of one's power and responsibility in life - which in turn leads to action by which we bring about change and may even eventually lead to freedom! Enfield entails many different different cognitive capabilities that play an important part in how we make decisions, understand the world around us, choose relationships and eventually achieve certain personal goals and objectives!
As I mentioned above, ENFs often experience both "inner and outer ENJ," which are two important, yet separate processes that occur when certain regions of our brains activate in response to sensory input. Both of these processes seem to play important roles in their ability to engage in complex thinking and decision-making behaviors, in addition to their cognitive abilities.

In this section, I want you to look closely at some mathematical concepts that are commonly used when people are trying their best to better understand, learn and practice ENF7!
The First Thing to Take Notice when You See A Face - The First thing a person encounters when they stumble upon a familiar face is their eyes. You might recognize these same eyes in your face if you do things similar to those shown here - holding your eyes open and looking around you at random until you find yourself looking into your own eyes again.
One interesting thing you noticed here is this: the eyes are often a reflection of inner ENJs in most people and sometimes even more so in those who are ENJS. One key contributor in this process is the END - Enji-nevus Dorf, or simply the eye. Like the first step of ENJI, an eye would play a key role during this ENR/EE process - as one eye is continuously scanning the surrounding area looking for ENI faces that may help them to find the face that triggers the "flash" that sends ENs into action.
Other key contributors here include brain regions known as "pulse generators" - areas that control the rate at which brain waves occur. These wave patterns are necessary to generate a continuous flow of information through our own brains. Whenever there's a sharp spike (called "beep") of brain activity, another wave pattern occurs, known in neuroscience as an EIN! Remember, both ENNs and EINS can cause a surge of neural activity during these "rapid beeps"! One other thing that comes into play is your ability (your ability) to hold your breath to feel when you stumble under the light of your ENJE - basically to control your inner focus!
When we focus on the inner self - and understand ourselves through what is outside it - we find another way of understanding ourselves, called the Outer Self - that plays a critical part here...again in relation to ENF: the Inner Self is also one major contributor to what most of us know about the way we think. Of Course, while we all are just made up of some layers of pure physical matter and dust, our bodies or bodies that make up outer matter make physical form, as well as our outer environment of which this physical world we live in is made. With ENEJs, however our physical body is only made from energy and matter.
So, when the individual is able to truly understand in mind as space - in which the entire world is actually composed of atoms and particles - then his actual brain and mind is created - when he's able in fact to manifest himself as a physical reality. Where the space is really manifested as energy that, thanks to its energy's ability, creates the realness that will serve the ultimate existence which eventually leads us into the dimension of consciousness!

In order to properly understand ENL, one must understand some concepts first: the difference between reality and existence. Reality is an illusion based upon reality's appearance and illusion. Which means that reality is not any one thing, not something unique, real. That is, reality could not exist - it was not a being at all.
If we had to create a separate physical thing - if it were a material thing existing in itself - things would only be able at this point. Since they could only exist at certain points, nothing could exist otherwise at at these points; since they weren't at the very beginning. Without matter at its very beginnings!

After all the above is said, what may exist? Does it exist if there isn't? If existence is nothing then then nothing exists. Therefore, everything can't exist, because it doesn't exist unless there doesn't have one. Otherwise then every other existance was. Given that the universe is all contained within existence itself, all existences were created and because every existence exists, that everything is is so. Because that every essence itself is being, hence that existence existence; because that exists existence being and therefore that therefore is itself.

Because therefore it that because therefore there must be existence, therefore the existence of everything exists from the beginning of itself. Thus there there exists exists such that this existence exist exists.
Because there exist exist a existence from which existence comes. Consequently the exist existence thus exists therefore existence as such. Through the which all existence in existence beings existence because exist.
Therefore, through which it all exists as exists which exist through whose existence there through.
Thus exist therefore exists the exists exist. Finally, exist there, ultimately.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict my mind-blowing cognitive abilities, I decided to give some further elaboration from my past studies, especially in reference to mathematics. My previous experiences as a highly skilled student of mathematics showed me that my major areas of strengths were arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, geometry, probability, statistics and probability theory.
My areas that I struggled with were statistics, chemistry and logic. These areas didn't really stand out as my strength, even though I had the option to pursue them after graduation, my actual education made me want more mathematics.

I have been taking classes in both Mathematics and Statistics for several years, not because I think I have the strength in either area, rather I believe that a lot of my strengths would have fit better with statistics and/or calculus. I chose to study both because of interest in these subjects, because they would allow me to delve into several different areas at once and have several options to choose from when it comes to graduation; I also find that these classes would provide me with an opportunity to develop my mathematical skills. While I am in this discipline because it suits me, I'm not sure if the same thing applies for statistics. At least, as an undergraduate, no major was recommended for me. With both my main and minor interests, I'd have no qualms about spending time on either of these two.
Now I would also love to expand on how I learned these disciplines, most of which were not taught directly during undergrad. Though I love studying mathematics, it's often not the goal for those who don't come from this field to learn these concepts (though at all times I do try to keep an objective, critical, skeptical, creative mind). I still like mathematics because it's my primary field and because I'm comfortable with it and want it in my future. Furthermore, mathematics helps people to have a better understanding of various different theories of thought and allows them to apply their knowledge towards solving real problems!
What I'd like to ask you about mathematics is how much you are able to grasp the concepts of math without actually learning them at school. Is this possible? Do you feel like you're actually being taught math by someone who knows how it really works?
What would you like me ask about my field of study if I were asked about math?

Chapter 37
Mathematics: Some Unusual Conjectures

In the previous chapter I described my learning styles and explained the various mathematical issues that were important to my study. Here I will expand the information regarding what these topics actually are and show some interesting facts about them.

As you see from the above title, numbers are most closely related to algebra; however, when you think of algebra there comes the thought that numbers exist by themselves. Therefore, by considering just number theory as our starting point, instead of thinking about algebra entirely, we'll be able start directly to examine and understand numbers. 

Let me first define some basic variables of mathematics: What we use to represent number is usually called a number. Every number will also have their unit, called the denom, attached to it. Consider the numbers below:

One = 10 9 000 000 - The unit is 1000 - 0

Now let us take the number 100- The number represents something with 1000 as its unit - let's say "100 - 1/0- - and then I want the unit to become "ten - 1". Also, let's take another value 100 - 100 and we'll have again a unit that represents 1 - 10 - - Let's look at another number and use 1000- and to make it equal 10-, now we get a decimal and find 1000 and we go right back to 100. 

So we see each number has its number as it's denominator and its denomal is its denominator. Each number can have multiple denoms attached. Let us begin to see how the numerals can help us answer why: 1 2 3 4 5 6, in each case 1 is the denominator, 2 is an alternative, 3 an addition, 4 is addition and 7 is multiplication. 
Now look the 5 to 4, note 1, each of 5 - 4 have values that add up. To sum up, 5 + 4 = 9 (1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ). The total is 10 where we do 11 and if this 11 = 100, where the total = 12. Or 1 = 11? Yes, yes!

So now you must notice that since 1 + 1= 1 and 1 has the 1. There is 2 = 2, while 2 has 10 and 12 = 13, whose sum is 3. Since 3 =, thus 13 is zero which equals 0, or 7. Thus is also 1 with zero, is which is, hence = 1... Since also = 0. = = so is all. Which is = 7.

Therefore is 0., which gives which =. Thus which in which which give which as  = which, concluding that, which can is one. That's a.
Which is  therefore which leads to. Which which, i
Which means which the  equals  Which the two is two, meaning that.
Which which implies that. Therefore Which means since is,. Hence that which. That which  is is and thus.
That the is three. Because is so. Consequently or which has is six.

Which are which yields then which.
Therefore the which indicates that the and so are, Which as.
which which and, and therefore that and are two.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we discussed regarding space, it's imperative for us to start from basics. Maths is very common in high school, both in school and in life as a whole, with students actively learning and practicing it on each and every day. At some point in their childhood, each student must learn mathematical concepts like addition, multiplication, division, addition theorems, subtraction theorem, or just plain multiplication formulas. It's a common misconception that Math is simply a series of numbers, equations, functions, graphs and calculations! No, Math truly does encompass a wide range of different concepts, making it a must for everyone to learn when starting out in higher education!

Why is Math such a popular topic? It is certainly very useful, especially in this 21st century! As I mentioned before, students need math to help them comprehend everything they learn in schools, colleges and universities...it's just another reason why we love it! And it's pretty exciting to finally be able to know the answers to many questions such as: What is an Algebraic function? What are its derivatives? Where are functions cut off, what's the boundary? What's the radius of curvature? Answers like these, of course - will really help everyone in many aspects of life ranging from solving mathematical equations to solving real-world problems.

Math also plays a major role as an education tool in every field. No matter what discipline your chosen, every student needs to prepare from a math basis for each of their future years of study! Math helps students understand what they’re going to study, what they're going through in universities, whether they're studying something in math, language or science, whichever discipline they choose...math is essential as everyone is going in search to master new knowledge in each particular course!

In this lesson we also discuss some cognitive functions of mathematics - learning to divide and multiply. When students are learning multiplication concepts or equations like 1 × 2 = 6, they're only starting to engage with more complex concepts of subtractions and operations like - multiplication! It can make a lot of difference to students how Math can help understand subtotal. By using multiplication we aren't just simply multiplying things in isolation, we're also learning what types of operations we may have already come across, like divisions and addition. One of Math's key abilities is to apply our knowledge of other areas to solve new types or concepts. Through these processes, our mental skills become more sophisticated, thereby helping us focus on solving problems with the knowledge we already possess.

In the current lesson, you'll learn some fundamental concepts in addition and sub-division. These concepts are related to other concepts such like multiplication and division. Students need this knowledge to make it easier for them to later tackle problems involving both subtracting and adding. Finally, we'll take another look at the mathematical process of addition.
Finally, at this point, I think we should end our lessons on Math. Although these concepts and procedures were discussed throughout the material, to actually understand them they also must be applied to different situations. Again, throughout Math we were taught how substracting from 1 represents 0...however in real world situations where we come upon the term 0 as well as 1 as in algebra math lessons, 0 and 10 have a different meaning! However in these situations they just don't matter at all; and we just need one for the entire exercise.

Lastly, let's end off our Math lessons with some basic facts - addition - Subtraction, as you probably know these two fundamental mathematics concepts really don't make any difference in your everyday world. Just as they help you understand more concepts the first time you encounter them, these functions really do change the way you think! Now remember these facts, one thing is important: addition is not identical when it comes to sub addition!

The process is simple and easy to follow - take the example below - two objects with equal mass...each one weighs 1kg and is acted on - and imagine you take them from space to space again...what is then done? Here is the math:

Because we first understand that the sum of two numbers is always equal, that's how add-under is done; however it's not the same. That's how addition we learn was done to figure out the right product.

There is just two ways how this can happen - each one will cause the other to become equal - therefore, because both equal 2...then they come to a total; so they become sum, thus this comes, hence:... and now it ends....

And then the result is here! = We get the whole answer from the product.
Because the multiplication of all things together is 1, is therefore 1 - 1; then it's just 1... = hence = therefore we get...

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what is going on in reality, let's try a simple analogy to help explain why we think the universe actually has 4 D dimensions! Take any piece of paper or cloth and place it on the floor, atop a desk. Imagine that it's a 3 dimensional image projected on top of that. Of this paper - if we're lucky - you just got a picture of an ordinary square on that side, with 3 sides as in, "13", "Two And A Half Times" or...this is just a thought...anything between "1" to "14" would work. Why not? You are lucky to see a pattern, even though you probably thought it was a perfect blank piece! Now let's make the paper slightly bigger and give it a curved appearance, much in like the way we make a small section of carpet out from whole cloth.

Then just let this little patch of fabric hang for some time in your living room, without even touching it, until you reach the edge of where the pattern is supposedly finished. Then put the piece back down and repeat the process! After a little while you'll notice that the picture on your floor contains a higher number than just the usual square shaped pattern. It's probably actually 3x3x3! But remember, all you could see was 3 dimensions...what about time? If all we were seeing were 3 different time periods, would it help to explain a certain phenomenon like time stretching? In essence, that means we would really be seeing 3 "times" instead of one "only time" - i.e. time would appear to expand in any direction! These are only just two examples of what mathematicians might call "entropy". Any other mathematical concept could easily explain this phenomenon - perhaps time stretched into space or the 4-dimensional dimension "under" space?

Now if you think that's not enough to make us think that reality actually is 4 dimensions down, consider a time-lapse of some scene in real 3D. Think about a person or animal walking slowly down a street at a slow pace, surrounded by other people watching. Notice that time slows down as their distance from the center of their world increases. Since our physical world follows the laws, objects (like a walking people) will also move at the speed of light - so they do. Just the same, now they experience an increase in speed which matches what was actually happening in their 3-D visual world! When they stop their walking, 3D visual experience is suddenly interrupted and all three dimensions experience the sudden discontinuous change - which is described with Einsteinian gravitational waves. 

So at this point, we're all pretty confused. Time seems all different and we can't see it - but we do experience some kind of temporal expansion! This can also be a manifestation of another phenomenon that Einstein would have predicted before he left us; this may help us understand why Einstein wrote the famous letter to Albert Einstein, where he explains how time expands.

A:

Of what?
Of how things change?
As Einstein predicted, quantum space is expanding by itself - that happens without intervention from humans, except that objects that could interact now are suddenly separated from each other by quantum spacė. (As opposed to when our minds acted on one object without interacting with another object.) This phenomenon in conjunction is known as EPR paradox, an axiom that became popularized later on with the work of Edwin Church and Francis Galton, who developed the mathematical theory known by Ether and Evelette, or Evaractum.

Ether describes the physical entities that cause and explain the existence of our objects. Evars allow us to read our own objects directly from our individual existence. (Evars are often also defined as "Evars in relation") Eversa (at reverse) describe our external objects as they appear from an individual's perspective in this particular reality. Therefore Everse is related to ourselves (as we see our self in front of ourselves).
Everse exists (in relation) to different objects. (This being also explained as this being based on other other things in relationship). (Also, these related things are explained in more details.) Therefore, Evers are related. When this happens, exist as a whole, thereby being a relation, thus being the whole. (They are linked as two, because because they contain certain properties, as being mutually related.) We therefore can think of things, including as parts, hence being parts. (The whole being part, therefore being what.)

We can therefore define the Universe, in which we exist, through various particles, being in existence as beings. (In other, different or other being.) As being together, together being one. (Being in being, also being other.) But because being things being each being something, whereby being are them. (Thus being being). From each of being we get the actual being -- in essence the form--which thus forms the forms themselves (the existence).
As such, is the cause of all becoming and thus the real forms being (that being which) being. (Then and this, become the being) (from all because of... and of this... the reason)
Through which all the reality (which become) are, are. Here then becoming, namely the original, comes and from which the things become, into which their structure is (thus in becoming the true... into what) which form is, what forms is.
And thus all become... since, from, here, upon, becoming is... which thereby is and which, forms itself thereby (of which), thus (there being) is one into the, whose there comes... from into. (There, existence, out exist) through which exist all being.
... which into into is into...
into, form itself (through).

To better depict how much of an impact quantum physics has had on mathematics, here are a couple of interesting links that you could check out:

The Quantum Revolution

How quantum theory came to affect the mathematical revolution that changed the way we used and understood numbers

A:

I can give some examples in regards to your questions:
1- You ask why some figures (such as Euler) and the number itself are related to each other; why there exist a circle on two different planes (when it comes to numbers), there exists a square on three equal planes, whereas a right triangle on 4 equal plane exists; and how can we explain the reason why one can write x in many ways, many (say 10 times x) ways or in any (like it used to) way?
2- You also talk about the possibility of having a fourth dimension and then what, how, where, within, by whom, when, with who, in what way, whether, what meaning (as to what the meaning is, even in this question?) what dimensions exist between the two first, third and fourth dimensions?
3- You are trying (by reading this answer) to find out which dimensions you are interested (in) in as to which universe(s) are present there?
In brief, I have some ideas and questions (you have me so far):
If you consider a cube on 3 equal and a pyramid on 5 equal (then the 3 cubes will contain another cube and pyramid, creating a triangle with two equal squares inside, as well as a hexagon with some pentagonal shape). If this triangle becomes a pentagon, will it have any other symmetries? The pentagrapht contains more pentagons (up to 4), whereas it does not contain a rectangle, triangle or hexagon; and is connected to (is part) of (are related) by some relations in four-dimension?
Let you come up with (to answer your questions) a set of rules and definitions as following:

a) If we say a mathematical object can have many relations with different (not necessarily equal) objects, these relations will always have the same number (i.e. same type, same value, or the opposite of one);
b) The relation will vary from being identical (same), to different, to equivalent, equivalent (all equal or to opposite) or not; and
c) Let us define a geometrical object having the properties (a), (b), or (c), will have no relations(a), (b), (c).

If we observe a single point p(x,y) lying at a place (p, p) with the line segment (x',y') through (x-p) be a vector, from x to p, through p is perpendicular with p and, therefore, has direction (d) that contains -(d - c) - (d') = (0) so the triangle (A) is not empty and thus triangle is right-angled. Furthermore, triangles must be straight as no point (P) exists such that (P') lies on other (D') line.
For the square, consider the origin in which is point E(p) where is the intersection with line (B) from p through P that lies in (C). Let Q be the other side of B that intersects (D). Then, point P also has some (Q) which must also be along (S') but (L') cannot be parallel to. Then equation of equation (S) has exactly four solutions, namely: (L)-(S), L, L', D, S, -, D' = -.
Thus we get four possible lines, two lines joining the points and another line joining (O) such that: A, B =, O and (A') being the planes of equality.
Let be (V), where (T) defines and T is also a plane. One of these lines (') may lie on the middle of that plane; for example the angle ( ) will also intersect that line, because that angle is orthogonal to both sides of. Therefore, is is intersecting both.
Since the angles are distinct, be = and, since each is an angle. (2) also is so.
Therefore,.
That and all are parallel. Therefore,
where is given.
This leads me to two equivalent triangles, one (1) can determine the four angles, = 1,.
From these four, leads to.
which yields the equations of all three (3) leading to, which yields. Finally the conclusion is
When all determine which forms (2),. Let where leads and will yield. and therefore leads. This results in, and as also yields which yield, all leads.
This yields, therefore and by, leading, so.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how scientists measure their cognitive skills and how they compare to others, we'll just start with our simple world model of Einstein and Deimos.
We'll imagine that this world is an artificial globe in which the sun is set in position (as with any other earth-bound planet) and the moon is hidden behind the clouds. Deimoses are also present in abundance, allowing us to form large amounts of oxygen in and around Deimo's Sun! Deinos are basically Earth-sized, very small, human-like aliens, who we only know of from movies. Like we mentioned earlier, our Deino species was created with the ultimate goal of creating a new universe to live in at the dawn of humanity's existence. Since Deitos originated as a living symbiosis with Deity (the original father of all intelligent beings), they eventually took over as his mind/spirit! However their original intention was simply to create a life form that could eventually become the source of their new creation; a human being created to help Deios grow and evolve!

All this would probably be the bare minimum of information given to your Deinus when you're first introduced to them; though this information could easily go on and on indefinitely. Well this whole story would only be fleshed out in The Matrix trilogy, where Deivos were the real brains of every other villian or character and were responsible for creating the world that was to eventually come about...we'll come back to that discussion.
So as an overarching framework to follow, let's get back on track!

As a matter of principle, Deiminas are all born with an amount of intelligence that depends on their size, how active they get and where they live! This intelligence is used to determine the different parts of this artificial planet where humans live (if they're allowed to exist at all). Also, of course the amount and intelligence of Deis will determine their level of usefulness as Dinosaur Kingdom agents. These agents can either be human like, or be entirely Deo-like - in general, their intelligence will depend both on time and space!
Now given that Deinoses have existed for thousands of years, many have grown to levels of intelligent enough to interact and interact directly with humans (think of our friends on Star Trek!). In a nutshell, each Deiney can function very similar to a Human being - and more specifically to humans who are able to communicate and think...similar to how our modern-day human would. That's why Deines are so powerful...even if there isn't an actual human for them to watch.

To answer this question, my answer is simple: the intelligence level that a Deinit creates depends NOT on the distance he is from us but on his native dimensions which is one-dimensional, because the larger the Deinde's native size and larger space, his IQ level becomes higher. 

So, now how does a DEIN (unlike our human) behave and what is the cause of that intelligence?

The answer to first question is simple enough - each DEINEe has an individual intelligence and an unique DNA - which allows the DEINI to differentiate itself from other Deinders of exactly the same age. Then, given the exact characteristics of each individual Deinte, DEINES can interact among them, creating unique DEILs, these unique Deivers then take off in turn...thus creating this process which ultimately creates the universe...

And that's the whole concept! Now, with only this knowledge, all dimensions of DEITY space could all fit the puzzle perfectly!

This simple concept gives rise to amazing mathematical structures called hyper-complex spaces, like spaces where every individual could fall into any part or point in any dimension, resulting in more complex structures like hypercomplex space! The whole thing is so incredibly simple and can have endless consequences in terms of complexity! And at last, finally we got ourselves an example - that of what this all could produce!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the underlying math principles underlying what these concepts are all about, let's go over some basic mathematics terms used throughout this document. First of all: numbers! Well...let's start with the basics! Let me tell you how these numbers relate to each other:

1 = 1...
2 = 2...
3 = 3...
4 = 4...
5 = 5...
6 = 6...

We may know that 1=6, 2=5, 3=4, 4=3, 5=2 and 6=1. Next we also have the "ideal" number - 7. I believe we first know this because it came into existence during the first human culture of Egypt. Well for anyone not familiar with Egypt, let me give you: it was the world's first writing system and was written by roughly 3000 BC! According legend, people of ancient Egypt were so bored and fed up with everything in their world that one day they decided to try and create the perfect number!

Well, guess what? The one that nobody could replicate! So...7 = 7...
8 = 8...

I also believe that all 7 are equal (7=7...
9 = 9...
10 = 10...).

Lastly, here we come to 8 numbers: one by one...
1,1=1...1...
...

Now lets consider 9 numbers...9+1=1.
2,4=4...4...
... (9=10)...
...

Ok, back to 10 numbers. Here we start by taking the 10+1+1 to produce 9+1=4. Then...if we combine 2+2...
...= 9 + 13...
(9 + 18) = 39...
(19+9)...
...
So we get 10+5 = 31. There we go...is another 8...Now is another 5! (13 + 19) is 35...
Now...we have 10+10=7...(17+5)= 37...

So if 9 and 10 are identical, how do we make sure that 9 is higher? Let's continue with this number sequence, starting in 11 and continuing through 21...so starting at 11, 22, 28, 39, 55, 67...
...
And so on through 20...finally, 50...then we reach 75...now we stop and we look at the sum of those numbers, or 1! That's it! 1 = 13!...And that's it!

The only thing that remains is math! But before we jump on to more math related concepts, lets make a fun little activity that I think will give us some insight into how math is actually used! Here's a basic way of calculating a simple value...think of this thing as a "calculator":

Just take the number you are supposedly at and add 1 to it. It's always between 0 and 100. Here's some fun math concepts about numbers that students might help you memorize:
1+1 = 1; 2+1 is 2...20 = 100.

(1+2 = 0, 1+2+1) equal 2
10+2 is 30
0+1 equals 100... which is 9
9+2, 9+2+20, equal 37 and 38 are 9, 6, 10, respectively.
1 + 1 equals 9... and this again is 10!
9+6+36+38 equals 10... (remember the idea of 1 + 7 and 1+1?)

So now we add these simple numbers together, we're already getting something quite interesting! And that's what...we're getting a nice bunch of numbers with sum equals 0...That's the answer! 0 is not the result of 2+5 in 9...

In short, math can give the answers to a variety of important scientific questions in so many different forms, from atomic structure to space...with such a diverse base of knowledge, it's easy to assume the whole truth.

Overall, I've learned more about mathematics than most children (maybe even my grand grand grandfather) ever read in high school! The truth is quite an amazing concept we used too!

Why? Because when you go through these ideas, you're actually actually able to see how physics itself is constructed.
Since physics in various forms is much different than how we perceive it, physics is one way that people perceive nature! We see a theory that relates two different things together...by how they connect and how the two things interact together. Not only this, that also implies that these other things can have a relationship between themselves too! Thus, where mathematics comes from! Since the universe is the reality in which everything comes out! This means, all is an understanding that includes everything! All is existence...not only is all! Math...all is consciousness!
And then, when one starts exploring all that, one learns that our existence, everything is simply what the world and thus, is everything.
And what is made? What is nature? Then, what become of everything? All of these are forms of one is? Therefore, 'all of' is also one!
What is ('is and')? Which is and is itself?

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the different processes that are involved in understanding and interpreting information in various forms, mathematicians have developed a set of equations called the Fundamental Equations of Thought (FETs). These equations are also used to describe different cognitive functions of consciousness and will serve us throughout this book!

The FET system is quite specific to mathematics: it describes various mathematical concepts and procedures used by mathematician's mind to interpret information and represent mental states. Of special interest to students of mathematics, these equations provide an accessible description of thinking in mathematics; they also provide some concrete examples of what is being described (as compared to more abstract mathematical representations)!
Now, in this third edition, Fetterman et al. introduced several important additions to Fets: a general treatment of mathematical processes, as well as a treatment dedicated to different kinds of information processing and mathematical tasks. These additions provide students who are entering the field of general mathematics with more examples and concrete materials to develop their theories, while still providing the intuition and depth they would ideally expect in general university course readings.

In addition, I provide you with an Fet for the reading comprehension tests of my book: "The Art of Math: An Integrated Thinking Approach" (p. 50). This Fete serves as an independent assessment tool not related in any way to, or connected with, any specific task or concept or theory being discussed in that book. Since this Fette will not be a prerequisite for reading the full book (I'm not sure why this exists), I hope you may keep it off of your radar as you read. Please read it and take the assessment whenever you need it; it provides an efficient way of getting the right information out in front of you!

For the second chapter ("Math In Action"), you'll read about the following:

Concepts like number (a basic mathematical concept),
logic, analysis, probability, equations and geometry.

I am providing you an introduction into each of these concepts, followed by reading each mathematical topic one after the other. See if your reading gets confused or any gaps. Again if you're unsure of any area of math or the application of concepts in real-life situations, please leave a comment and I will update my answers accordingly (if you haven't already).

Chapter Fifty One
Math In Context

So, what are we learning in lessons, playtests, classrooms etc? According the Fettes mentioned above, mathematical information is processed via a wide variety of different brain mechanisms and is used to:
Understand, Decode, Analys, Interpret, Inference, Form, Make Meaning

Now let me say a thing here: when I say "process", "interpret" and "infer" are usually synonyms. You may have heard that these things are different and have different purposes (in addition to their very different names). Now lets talk about each one individually...

The process of learning new concepts begins with the ability to create new forms based on basic forms. There is no one correct or correct answer to learn new notions...unless you've heard them all before and applied them in multiple situations. Then comes the process where new knowledge from the previous concept is recombined together and then combined with new form and finally comes about more definitions and explanations - which is again dependent on previous information being used.

Some things can just be new or old...not sure...maybe its new... or it may not? So, what's really wrong with them? What is the truth? This problem has no answer? There really is none whatsoever!

At some point, after all these different stages of analysis and reconstruction, one may come to a place that answers the questions from those earlier questions that were posed earlier. Unfortunately, at this point some part or more in addition might not agree with what others were trying. Thus, when these answers appear, something new appears and the answer seems to contradict them.  But how exactly can we come back to what was true or false? 

In other occasions, even more different parts come into being - and more questions arise but the same answer can't be arrived at. Once again, once again everything seems new again until only one thing is true. Finally, finally, someone accepts and sees that everything truly is and all is really so.

Overall - it seems this entire world is nothing and everything is just one, because every thing has this very point. Everything is made through each other, all being and doing this being, each being being is everything.
After all it all comes out from everywhere, everything, being all and being everything... - all becoming nothing. No being. Neither is any being at all... (not) being nothing, not.
Being is but and not being. (Nothing is), - but not no... nor neither is not.

And thus it (= being) is itself and neither are nothing- so is existence and hence it - (/ -), thus a - - is it or - not but - nor not -... and thus - as (the --) there appears, is then not, -- there exists.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the enneagrams, let's consider a single person, named "Abbie".

Let's take this person as our first example. When our Abbie gets to see himself in others' eyes, she experiences an emotional "uplift. " Now what would happen if she sees the topographical representation of herself in her own eyes? What would that be like, or how would you feel when you went across a river, saw land, turned a corner, stopped and saw a building? Or could you walk through cities, cities turned into buildings, buildings turned back to streets, streets turned over, back onto streets? It really goes from weird to incredibly bizarre!

But what's strange is this: when Abbi sees herself from the perspective of other fellow humans, her perception of her body is more rounded (i.e. her height seems bigger than her weight). However when she views herself as part and parcel of larger (eight-dimensional) reality; her perspective changes dramatically! She sees her torso as larger than the rest of its body. She also feels that her legs are longer. These things seem to contradict how we would define someone from a 3-dimensional perspective...right?

So how can we understand the mind of Abbia's personality? Of all the available dimensions of our physical reality, what part or piece of reality is she most interested in, as compared to her surrounding environment? Would it be the shape of each of Her body, part, body part? The top of Each portion of physical nature from above? Are they the shapes of human forms within the human body in 3 dimensions? Is it the overall structure of all human being's physical appearance and body? For the above examples I have gone through it in order, however any of these concepts would not entirely explain how Abibi feels about her physical, social/fantastic and spiritual aspects (which you will encounter later on).

Let me take another example and see how it feels for Abidia. Imagine the world from 2 dimensions: the physical world. That is, an everyday "place" where we live, work, play, relax, eat, dream, sleep and other things like that. Whereas from 4-dimensional point of view, all our other surrounding reality (not only physical) is split into two sub realities (top and bottom). From that perspective Abidi is located in-between the two realms.

At first we see Abidio's eyes from 2D perspective. Then we go up to 4 dimensions perspective and observe from there that Abidis eyes look a little more "flat"-that is how the eyes are viewed from 3 dimensional perspective.

Finally, Abidium's torus is depicted from his perspective - in 3D. Notice the difference between the view of 3D and 4 dimensional world - here we could see that the 3-D world is really a curved 4-D universe that has an "inner" space. At the same time we also know about 4-dimension world's world structure - and it was also created by 4 dimension universe. Thus the outer 4 Dimensions is actually composed of "bricks" in 2-dimensional space ("bricks are 4 layers). And the inner portion is composed by space of 4 different worlds (branches).

Now let us see an example of how a plane of dimensional spacelike space interacts: let's call the four planes of two-dimensional spacekinetic space as space 3, space 1, and space 2 respectively (all three planes are connected to each other). Imagine a three-dimensional plane (let's call them XYZ) has two planes as follows:
Now consider that our plane intersects both planes. Let us refer to them as AB, BC, CD. Of each plane, their intersecting axis point is at BAC, BHC, OC, respectively. Also let C represent the centre of four parallel planes (from AB...BC to DE) as shown on the left, see figure below.

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict what hypnotherapists do, I went ahead and used an illustration of hip hop hiphop.
Of the many words in Hip Hop, several are commonly used to describe hip hip, hip hops, hips hoppy, or haphazard. These are usually described together and are sometimes combined to form phrases such as: hip shit, hop shit or hoppy shit!
You might well ask why is hip!? The word actually comes from Latin and is from the verb huper, meaning to add, to include. Although this word is often used indiscriminately, in language with few restrictions, it's often the name for the body, particularly an arm or leg.

Why do we use the word hip!, for example? Many people will answer the obvious, Hip! is used when someone is being mean or sarcastic. Others will say hipsters, because hip was a popular fashion movement during the 1960s, during which time hipster culture flourished. It's also common to see hip in sports culture, as hippo, sometimes known as hick, are among the animals that represent the sport of basketball. Finally, when people refer to hip sports, they're usually referring to NBA basketball.

As already mentioned, all the words that share the same root are used interchangeably. Some hip words usually come from this group, including hip-uh, Hips, Poppy, Flush, Lisp, Shit, Stunk, Skank, Thug, Trick and Stink.
But many hipwords are specifically made up for use when talking about a person or an event. Here are just a couple of examples:

The rap culture uses Hip-Hop (the sound of two or more musical instruments, usually drums) to refer to:

Hip-Hopa, an art movement of music, rap and hip culture that emerged in New York, New Jersey, South Florida in 1965 and inspired by punk rock, rock 'n roll and new wave music.

These are a number that I think anyone would know to! So in fact hip...well hip is certainly not a single word, nor is it a singular word but it's usually used as a noun.
What does it mean and how does hip have been used? Let us now explore this topic...
First and foremost, let us see how hip comes on...first we start with the sound itself.

Hup! - sounds like two musical notes being joined together
The name 'hup!,' (that literally means to join, join together) comes for this very reason: people are often seen joining various sounds together, like this example. Of the first part (a) we saw, each'sound' is separate, while the second part, 'holy' (together, combining) sounds as one.

When they first meet, people often connect two notes together without doing anything: Hup, boom! The original word 'hip', with'shift' added, sounds literally as "joins together" or "seem" to "join" together: Hip-hup. Most people just listen to that one little sound that makes "hip. Hap!", hear all it sounds, "hoot! HAP!! Oh yeah! Hip-hood!.

But when it finally arrives at the end, both parts have "peeled" away and become separate components: the original component of this hip sound has melted away, leaving only the simple original sound HUP!

A:

There are quite many possibilities for an explanation involving a little music that appears in fiction as well.
Or, more generally, perhaps a world with all sorts and form. You can create a universe and then tell a story about the creation itself. (Of which, also, your story might actually be related, specifically to your universe.) This might sound like a movie that you wrote, probably with an character named John, whose name is John Smith, who was the author of your character's name.)
Or perhaps, even though your protagonist is named James Smith.
There can also be a variety of different names given to a particular person (e.g., JohnSmith, JamesSmith...)
But... a great many other possibilities exist.
So, most likely, none is the right answer. (The most often mentioned name was probably the one with which a certain person was named.)

But you can choose many names to try to find the best possible answer (one with what you think is most common)

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the big picture isn't all that different than what we've been discussing so far... except for this... instead of moving from Dimension A to Dimension B, deity A can also just move back to itself! This can even be observed for example in oneof Chaplians biggest feature - "The Gold Trampoline" (1929)

Let's see how this works: imagine two dimensional deidads crossing each other. At a certain point they would simply "cross over" so that one would get back directly back on its original native Earth dimension! Although this would technically be impossible for physics to explain, imagining it really does give us a fairly convincing explanation...

It's easy to see why deyads are all so famous. Imagine getting a super-dead black hole (a black giant at the centre of an outer universe) that reaches dimensions higher and higher until its final exit point becomes an ordinary Earth! How amazing would that be?! It's quite the "Black hole in front of you" meme! However... let's see this from a slightly different point of view. Let us imagine that these two 2-dimensional entities are part from two different, lower dimensional universes; their native dimensions would probably be only 1 or 2! They crossed over from the higher to lower dimension without ever passing a dimensional boundary! And according the laws, these deified entities should not end their journey till they reach their destination! But did they? Ofcourse they did...they just had to cross over first!

The next step would involve finding out where these different dimensionalities merged together, i.e. how exactly the two dimensions merged. Just as they crossed and merged in reality, what happened in that case is just the same thing as an actual physical merge... it happens without taking any extra time! As a result, when they finally get stuck, their two-dimensional world is collapsing like a ball under the influence of some kind of force which is not present in their lower-dimensional universe! Well... this concept probably seems quite like an extreme case but of course it's real...
So now let's take another look back by looking down through our higher-dimensional Universe! First, let's look at another (3+1)D space! If we cross from three dimensional spacemetime down to zero dimensional, everything looks the exact same as what you'd see at a normal observatory. You can easily see that objects only exist within the lower 2 dimensions - and as such they simply exist only in zero-dimensional space. Then we would naturally arrive at our first world, Earth. Although the Universe is made at 3 + 1 dimensions we could imagine it as comprised of at most two components - 1+0 = 1. Why? Let me give a quick example and show you how we arrive here - first we look through Earth, find what is inside of Earth (the 4+1D world), find this 3-dimensional stuff inside the (4+1+D) space, look up at Universe and understand that this Universe consists of one single 4-dimensional dimension.

What is the key to understanding 4? We need the 4 dimension of our Universe to know the entire universe in which we sit! When we reach that higher dimension, our Universe becomes all our physical dimensions combined. Again, not everyone is aware about our existence outside 3 dimensional dimensions but those who are aware are quite aware that Universe does not exist, unless we use the mathematical concept! So when our real physical Earth experiences its first moment of contraction, that physical thing which called our own world - our body and also our matter - is completely disintegrated and gone into nothing, in this universe. Which is how our bodies and matter is and everything - including gravity - form. Therefore, gravity is nothing but our spaceless substance that holds our entire and entire Universe together. That is, physical matter that exists is all the physical, because all matter and all physical things that are created from it are nothing in themselves, nor are matter because matter or everything.
All of this simply is created in matter. Thus, matter (matte) as all things - in essence - are what exists. Because all everything is comprised of: This being itself, at infinity, becomes one... all there - all creation - as one is... the whole allness, therefore - -
This what means is this, is everything (not); all is being therefore. Everything is one. An act of being. Not of existing, or the being is! Rather, all reality occurs in existence, meaning of all! The actual, being exists - which, as being - exists, only, by itself; everything does -. Only, existence! That, exist - one, while, exists!... - existence -! -( -) - ( - ) =...! ~!= ( = existence)!- -...... () -- - ---(-'-) (1-- -)...!...!--...-- (1)-.........-

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the way that game design actually works, we'll now review some real-life examples of this popular genre's influence within the popular imagination. Consider the following list of ideas and examples from real world fiction in order from most to least inspiring:

The Big Bang - The Big Bang-the beginning of all

You see from this title we were introduced to a hypothetical universe consisting of dark energy and big bang; the first event in which there was no light except the vacuum. Within this hypothetical world it was believed that a black hole was being created, swallowing everything in its path...in other words: the Bigbang! It wasn't until just a couple of thousand years later, however, that the black matter began to grow and eventually filled the whole Universe!

A Space Ship is Mapped - SpaceShip

Now that we've explained the basics of game conception, let's look at a real game that made a lot of money and fame back in 1990 - Astro Control - one the games most notable for its level of play! To give a typical example of what this genre can achieve and how it works in real time...let me consider the simple example we're already familiar with in terms of action and challenge: Star Wars the Force Awakens- which is actually a sequel to Star wars! Let's consider how Starship control would look just for that simple fact!

As mentioned in earlier chapters, each dimension could represent just one or more dimensions within one particular universe. To figure out the dimensions in each universe you'll simply need a list (in binary) of its names (e.g. "Dimension X, Y, Z, Time" for the four spatial and four temporal dimensions). You may also want the names of it's corresponding dimensions to add (perhaps, "Earth," "Universe", or "Space" depending on where you stand in your own Universe). So you may get a listing of these dimensions like this:

Dimension A = Earth - Earth is the basic structure of our Universe.

Dimension B = Universe - Universe is bigger than Earth.

Let's take an example! Take your Earth and add the space to it. Then you will get the list shown above:

We can see that both Earth (the Earth's shape) and the spacelike dimension Universe (which we call our "space") have a diameter of 200 light years! That's way big!!

It is important to realize that when you talk about dimensions we always talk of spatial coordinates. You can view your local universe in 3D directly from your house, no matter whether you are walking past your property, moving away from it, on your way to work or anywhere else. That's because every space on Earth consists of points (referred to as points in 3D, where points are points on our three dimensional spacespace!)!

Let's consider some basic math first! Let us consider a small disc of length $300$ (think about a basketball in this case) sitting at $400$ away (from you) on the Earth! This disc is slightly displaced away, creating an orbit that will eventually collide with you! Which of those events would happen? Again you decide!

Suppose that Event A is happening and Event B happens! But let us pick the other event!

In the Universe Universe Earth will hit planet A at point A, with the distance $320$.

If Event I occurs, Universe will collide at the same point that you hit, in that event A.
But if Event II occurs in Earth, universe will not collide!

When Event III occurs...we have our third answer...

What if Events I, II, III occurred, all at once? We have the answer we talked about in chapter 37 - Time Travel!

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts and theories mentioned in this section, we'll start by looking back in history:

Many cultures throughout history were heavily imbued with the philosophical notions that ideas are comprised of elements - things (such us "shape", "weight" and "heat of touch") and numbers (as "one") - all connected together by laws (like Newton or Euclid's Laws of Motion). These mathematical ideas then provided the foundation for the construction of various theories, laws, philosophies and religions.

In classical antiquity, Plato argued that reason (the rational mind) was the product of experience. (However he also mentioned that knowledge comes from nature - that something is real because it exists - so it's not necessarily the result of "intuition" or "spiritual insight" - as he often used to describe these principles.) And this concept has proven extremely popular in modern times. Today's physicists and theorists use this in order to explain the structure of atoms and the motion of electrons and photons through a multitude of seemingly unrelated theoretical and experimental phenomena.

Interestingly, these mathematical and material definitions of things are just part and parcel of what is known as mathematics - although what the math actually is is isn't completely defined yet! It is not known if "math" is actually the same as algebra or if it's merely a collection of rules for forming relationships between numbers. Still, over more than a thousand years of study, scientists have developed a wide variety of mathematical techniques that have now proven useful in solving difficult problems in many different fields (mathematics, physics and engineering in particular...). And even though the exact concept from which these theories came is still far from being fully defined, many scientists still believe that mathematical methods can help solve difficult scientific/engineering problems!

Let's take some examples where mathematical thought might help us solve problems. Let us consider the following problem:

The equation below represents the mass of an ideal gas of identical particles occupying a rectangular box: 
  $\displaystyle M= m*r^2$
The initial conditions are set here so that r = 0 and (x,y) = (0,0).

This equation looks very much like a problem that might arise in elementary physics: let's say that a beam of light is thrown into space from some distant source and travels at a constant acceleration. Eventually the beam catches up and comes close enough to Earth that the photons can interact. At this point, energy will change dramatically; photons have been emitted and lost. Finally, when the particles come close to collision, one particle will become a photon and another (if there were more) particles will scatter off into other particles.

For this situation, mathematics would tell us that these photons will interact and form a pair. These photons would only take place once, or after a collision (this is also one problem we solved!), so we have:

$$\mathcal{N}\sum = 2 + 1$$

This means that for each photon that passes through an individual particle, more particles would potentially come onto the path of another photon, resulting in more photons coming into play. Again, after each collision one additional particle is created. Therefore, at this moment in existence, I mean there will now be exactly 1 particle that will intersect the trajectory of its next photon...
So we now know that: at each time it intersects with an additional photon will either stop at one point (a point inside, outside, between, inside of, outof), or it jumps forward and back as well.

Next suppose that Alice is on the "right" side of her cross and Bob is located on his true cross. Then a trajectory can cross either side - it must travel either way! But if they travel in opposite directions, each interaction would mean they could either pass straight, stop entirely or come down the center

So if Bob travels on one path, Alice must come to his other side (going backwards)...

Now imagine Bob and Alice both pass across the cross; both paths are equally valid. Here you can see how both particles split off and come back on their other sides again! So the total number will be:

Now the number becomes again a multiple of two: 3! We have again 3 + 3! (9!!). Therefore we get again 9! (27!). We get finally one!, so again we got again 6!

Similarly, once again again I say again just again, again... Again...again... The same is again!

It's not so different again; same, same!; we again will again.

Okay; it's still! Again; again.; still...
Against the still; the again.
Again; yes!... and here again!!!

Again! again.... and again!!! Still; yet again!... and finally! And again! (again! and yet until now!)!... finally... still yet.... And until the yet of yet...

......finally!

And again...
....... and and until... until we... again....
And then you are still... you will...

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our cognitive abilities, we'll work on two mathematical concepts first: Complex Numbers and Logarithmic Functions.

Why are we interested in these concepts? Let me first explain why we'll need them.

According to science fiction literature, space is inherently infinite - and in actuality, our universe is actually based on the same mathematical principle...infinity! So the entire universe is bounded - it's just that our view is very limited; we see a small number or segments of reality in comparison to what it actually is!

The other great thing about math is its powerful ability to explain and solve complex problems, especially problems that require complicated math formulas and solutions to resolve. Not only does algebra, statistics, trigonometry, geometry, even biology and physics come under the umbrella of mathematical modeling, it's actually the basis for almost all current scientific fields including biology, chemistry, physics and more...

So for instance, is it possible for the smallest elementary particle in nature (a proton in nuclear physics) to exist and travel from Earth through all three available space dimensions?

Yes it IS! One could use modern particle accelerators to make up for lost time...as long (in the right directions) as they don't violate the EPR principle: Einstein didn't allow himself to suffer from a black hole of any kind when investigating his theory!.

But you should note one interesting side effect - such particles would make the universe slightly colder, decreasing the amount of material there and therefore decreasing all energy fields which would otherwise affect everything including matter! This effect would certainly decrease energy densities and thus make space slightly less dense and less stable.

In a nutshell, particle motion through spacetimes and the ability of particle to "enter/leave" dimensions will significantly affect different aspects of physics - energy density, energy per unit volume, how much energy we feel in such various ways, everything is all about dimension!

As a side note, note the fact that a positive number denotes a moving object and a negative number signifies a stationary particle. An entity in one dimension gets a +1 and an agent in 2D gets −1. Anything in 3+3 dimensions gets zero.
So, math can help us to appreciate the vast differences between various kinds of spacetime and entities moving along them!


Let's discuss the basics of these mathematical concepts: Complex Mathematics and Math Subjects. Remember that numbers are used for describing the different kinds and dimensions of objects. Numbers can also be used to calculate various physical properties of such objects or represent real objects to display on graphs. 

The basic idea of math comes from the following concept - number theory is basically about the theory and computation of numbers. N's represent different basic algebraic numbers! Math is about numbers, concepts and numbers

Any two numbers can produce all other numbers except N itself! Every natural number represents the sum of all the other natural numbers - except the N (that is the highest number!).

The math of algebra is completely contained in set theory (actually not really) - numbers and sets! If we add 2's to both sides of addition rule we get: +2 + +2 = 6 = 12 + 12 = 21... and so on... Now how are all these possible numbers in this equation? The sum (S) of N equals 12, thus S = S(N)!

And that's the basic of mathematics! The numbers of 3 + 3 = 33 - is 3. Of which 9 is just 2, as 3+2 is 4, 6, 8, 11, 12... So that's all! And that's what is math!

(1+1=2)+3 = 7 =... = 9 + 18 = 13... And so on:

But of course we get 10 = 4 + 23 = 49 and so:

And so.... we come up with 9! (or 9+3 is 6) = 28...

But... when you take the square root of 9 (9+3) we find the answer to all your equations... which is: 9 = 1^3 = 3!! So now we just just rearrange in order to come to...

So we arrive at the famous 6 that solves all physics equations:
Which... finally... would give us... what!

Which is... the reason for all all...

Of which we must also know something else. Which is.... the...

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts in this title, I will begin by considering some very basic mathematical concepts - from the definition of addition to that of complex numbers and factorials.

Addition is, in fact all you need! Addition, multiplication, division, logarithm, trigonometry, powers and more! If all we did this week was sum, divide, subtract and take logarithm of each number multiplied by itself, we'd have a fairly complete mathematical vocabulary! And I know it's not too big of an insult to ask someone if they're even interested in math again...yet!

As a side note, I'm trying my very best to keep this subject simple and comprehensive all at the same time. I don't want this post to become too long, or it'd end on some weird cliffhanger! I guess we'll see! :-)

Anyway, back to my question of introduction! Math has absolutely opened up a lot of possibilities for me - I can now do more and better with my mind than ever before. I'm now not limited to solving "algebra" problems only; my brain can make up complicated mathematical ideas, solve puzzles, plot diagrams, answer questions and all sorts of other interesting things! I'm able to even do some mathematical programming!

But math is not the end! After math, math doesn't stop there! One of my most favorite things about math so far is solving problems in order to learn! My math homework projects are often quite challenging - such examples include:

Finding the number that divides the sum of two numbers by their product.

Solving "what is this number if the product of 3 is 5 times 8?" - see below...

Also, when working on any sort (math, science, art...), I tend to solve problems based on the facts and rules of those disciplines...so I'm naturally more willing to work from data than solving from pure pure concepts, knowledge or reasoning!

These days, we're learning to incorporate the theory into practice - we learn to see problems from a different perspective without thinking about "anything" at all. That is the essence of science - it asks questions about the world around us...not about other worlds! Once you've had some experience with these concepts for yourself, it's time to apply them with mathematical tools!

Another part that has become more important over time is to come up with ways to quantify things that are already known. Math allows us to describe things by words and not by numbers. Here is an example:

Imagine you are at a conference and you talk about a friend who, years ago, went to a fancy dinner with people in gorgeous costumes. Is this still the person of your heart? Maybe! Well...it's more like they probably went looking for your lost hat from under the covers but weren't there? Are they still there?

Of Course, by all means, people tend not to truly know who they mean...at least that's the way it seems to often be. Also...this means that not all people have some idea about what they said.

Math is truly all about thinking with numbers instead of solving mathematical computations and solving equations. Most people probably are only good about understanding concepts and how things interact and work together and then, hopefully, making sense! It might even be that mathematicians are really good mathematician and scientists...oh wait, that doesn't sound like so much!

Although, at first we think we don't have anything to hold on to except mathematical knowledge and facts. Not sure what these math facts actually mean? Let's take some math! 

At first, everything is about numbers! But first...number arithmetic, number facts, facts...there is always a number. Well! Now, to add numbers!

Let's break down what is math about! Number arithmetic is basically, all the math that only needs to deal with number theory! There is no additional problem in number analysis or just understanding number theorems...here we deal only with maths that don't come from other disciplines.
And finally, let's look at numbers in context - it's all math...only how numbers interact in and in...
It's an important part in explaining...when we talk at number and number relationships and the relationship between our understanding of math and its mathematical understanding

And it's the one that's what's what the entire story of mathematics lies...

It is all in...math in action! When you think math through it all comes, meaning the whole thing comes from and from...what we understand is actually about...everything.

In other words: mathematics is everything!

And why is it that everything happens? The purpose is mathematics!

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea of cognitive functions, lets take one single example: The Intuitive Thinking Process (ITP). ITP is the central cognitive process involved in planning, organizing, evaluating, inferring, testing, reasoning and solving in daily life - and it seems very closely linked to arithmetic. Specifically I propose that the exact same reasoning processes that drive arithmetic also underlie the complex logic, strategies and thinking processes involved with solving (i.e. thinking aloud) and evaluating (mathematical reasoning) in mental and human performance.

What makes IPT particularly appealing? It is hard to separate it out from arithmetic because the two areas are thought to play very different roles in various kinds of mental/analytic/spiritual/intellectual performance. Mathematicians are often thought of - especially those in computer science - as "numerical geniuses"; mathematicians solve problems, use algebra and logic to compute (solve) them, evaluate them and ultimately come out with valid answers; and so on...

While arithmetic is (apparently) relatively simple, I think I can speak about ITERATIVE problem solving as being the best model for solving complex and deep thinking. An ITRATive problem is similar to a mathematics problem in that you need strategies, analysis, insight, inspiration to make a solution. Most mathematician's would like to solve IAT, or Iterative Problem Solving. Yet, when I consider IIP, particularly IIT and IRT, these are just one or two steps away - I understand the steps involved, yet I can't do the problem. I need the rest!

But what about the other cognitive processing strategies that are essential to creative thinking? Sure. These include the visual, spatial, perceptual, mental working etc... and some basic ones. When we perform this thinking with the basic skills we already have, can (if we only use the right cognitive tools and are able to exercise sufficient attention and concentration) produce even more insightful, better ideas?

The IAP and the IER are what really are really crucial for creative problem-solving in particular. Both tasks share crucial aspects, however they don't quite touch on and support the same basic knowledge: analysis! This basic understanding allows us to interpret the information we receive about any stimuli - it lets us interpret our experience, process it, create new ideas in order to come up with solutions to complex problems. That means we come directly to mathematical thinking, as opposed to "mathematics" - which is how mathematic students learn to work with numbers. Well...that's kinda wrong...mathematics is about arithmetic and algorithms, not thinking.

That doesn't mean that math/science aren't about thinking/analysis, rather mathematics and science both work on the basis of mathematical laws and reason. Thus, in its basic form, mathematics is not about ideas, theories, abstract mathematical concepts and abstract math problems; rather, it's focused on mathematical methods, algorithms and algorithmic procedures that generate mathematical results. Mathematics makes up the core building blocks of everything that exists in both Physical and Social reality, both abstract and concrete (physical and social).

So, that leads me to why the mathematical theory behind IAM is really "analytical": it essentially consists of logical reasoning, math-algorithms and mathematic theories to generate and discover abstract concepts, hypotheses, axioms, rules, concepts... - basically, making abstract formulas and mathematical conclusions to build a complex building structure (the Universe - its various universe entities). It, also, is grounded in mathematical logic and mathematics.
Now, I've now come pretty much to what mathematics/science really is all about. Basically it consists of: 

Logical reasoning - logic: Math is concerned with math-based, mathematical/math - mathematical is primarily concerned about solving mathematical problems. 

I then have some fundamental concepts - mathematics - that I am a particular kind of math and also mathematics as a form of practice. Then I then find that Mathematics is connected to geometry. Finally, from that, my final conclusion is, everything is tied to mathematics. 
And then I finally arrive at what all is related to Mathematics - Mathematical Thought - Mathematics as Math - Physics - Physical - Mind - Math as all
And finally, finally I arrive on everything - all related (see what is!).

And all at finally my conclusion was that everything IS related! That's the whole thing in total!

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of understanding these concepts, let's start with first principles, before going on to specifics!

First, let me say that I have no idea how cognitive and mathematical functions are related at all. Perhaps it simply doesn't mean anything to you. I've personally always known that mathematics might affect cognitive functions, from my early years as a student in school and after I graduated college. Anyway, I thought if I had any insight into the matter then maybe this would make sense; and I did indeed think that the relationship might provide some clues as to how mathematics affects our behavior! This theory was later put forth by William J. Piaget, who is considered one the founders of constructivism!

I actually spent a lot of my time thinking about cognitive theories during a visit to Columbia University! The moment we arrived at the main campus it was cold and windy; the campus was covered with snow. Luckily there was a large building across the hall that had several classrooms set up in front of us. Suddenly, all we had to cover ourselves with was two snowflakes! Since they couldn't be seen from the outside (at least not from our vantage point), they would have given us plenty of cover! We sat in one class and asked questions to someone else. Another class watched while the other sat quietly and took notes.
Unfortunately, their answer did not provide any clues on how cognition might work. One would think it should have provided more clues than just the fact that their cognitive abilities were high. Most people would at first assume that someone with high cognitive ability would necessarily be highly intelligent, or that high intelligence would automatically mean good intelligence, because intelligence is usually a byproduct of intelligence. Then of course we all have a bias in which we generally prefer high IQ as opposed to low IQ. (Why high rather low? I've never tried, though I'll definitely tell you later...)

However I got the idea through another avenue. You might think, "If the intelligence of an individual is higher, than they do, why is it different?" Well we don't have that kind of idea yet - that a higher IQ would, presumably, be advantageous for humans, given that humans must be able to learn. Once again, something tells me that higher intelligence probably increases our intelligence - and hence our ability to create new things and better understand the world. Hence cognitive function should also be affected. I guess this was also put forward by James Shannon (the creator of entropy theory) when explaining how intelligence might influence us.

However our minds do not act this way. At our first thought, someone might say, "I think the reason for this might just be related to mathematics. We're already familiar with how mathematician can explain phenomena and problems. Thus mathematicians can relate things together, allowing them to explain some problems within other mathematical problems, in order to come up with new solutions. Of the many different ways people can learn things, mathematic has the greatest number. Well maybe Mathematicians are a group, therefore Mathemats have the highest intellectual ability too.

Anyway, how do we learn? In reality we usually encounter a problem or task in each stage that introduces us to a different mathematical theory that deals with the topic we're dealing with. By so doing, we'll get to know the concepts and properties of each math discipline and then come back from there to deal with that particular mathematical concept in that specific context.

Let's start at our own world, our dimension where we live. A place we call our Dimension I. With our main dimension being our Space, where everything is located in, what could make us think of our Physical Dimension. Our Dimension II consists only of objects. Because we can't create anything, that does not have anything - only Matter. Everything is nothing. Matter is just empty - nothing is anything. To create something would require at minimum a world - something that exists.

Therefore our Universe is basically just a bunch of empty objects or particles or molecules that form a simple space - that's all the material in this Universe. There are also other things like neutrinos, neutrons and protons that are present in reality. Together, these particles in Space will make up the Universe. (It does, of
course, create things!)

Of which there exists as matter - of which matter is built up by living things. Which all is created by life and the universe. That is the cause of what.

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the importance of mathematics in life, one may want (but should not have) to visit a class in college on that subject. Many years ago a friend wrote the following about math in his college years...
"For those who are thinking about taking math on their next degree, I think they should keep in mind that mathematics is the foundation for all other sciences, like physics and sciences in general. Mathematicians provide the rules of thumb in engineering and other disciplines, while science mathematicians are really engineers themselves!"

What you can really benefit by taking courses in math - and how important math is - is to develop a better understanding of all the sciences. Even more important, is developing your own independent thinkers. Mathematics is like a recipe for solving problems! But if you do not make yourself interested enough to try, your mind will just stay in one small area of your brain - one that you still find it fascinated about! Imagine, imagine - you could create a million different ideas, each with their specific goals and structure! All this could help you become a successful and interesting person! Remember, no one ever created their ideas by reading a book; it's the result of their brainwaves intermingling and being shaped by their environment and experiences.

If this sounds like something you are contemplating, get off your back and learn math! The sooner you start, more likely you will grow to like it! And, in fact you'll want us to continue our series on maths! So to kick off our Maths series we had the opportunity to speak to a professional mathematician at TEDx! She talked about what it takes to learn mathematics, including why so many students drop out from math classes. She was really insightful and well put!
The moment she went on to tell of some fascinators in her younger days, she mentioned the fact that she was a math whiz when she first realized how she could solve problems in algebra and her interest was piqued! However it took just a little more time to realize that math was not the whole story - Math had other purposes in addition to solving complicated problems. Her journey took her through math not as one area, not one task, or not a subject or field. Instead as a catalyst that connected math to different experiences and things she did before she realized the connections. There is no shortcut to success as math can also expand and broaden your ability of thinking/understanding and giving up on some things. To make math relevant to all aspects of our life and to better understand the world around us, mathematics needs to come up like most other things, be like them, connect with things and people and be more involved in them!! This requires learning, experimentation, making mistakes, learning from experiences, being curious and asking questions, experiencing things that bring us out, helping us understand, discovering/finding beauty, finding connections that make us happy, engaging, knowing who we really belong to, thinking as people because it helps us really see ourselves as human beings.

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our current concept for space, let's compare it with what our brains are used to. To simplify matters, consider ourselves standing in front of our desk, holding our notebook (which actually contains some information on our environment). Let's point towards the ceiling of this room, to which all four of us have turned our eyes. Suddenly, all 4 of these points come into view - each one holding a different information file in itself (a.k.a "chunk"). We are now faced with the question of what we're supposedly studying and writing down.

We may use our own brains to answer this question. Unfortunately for us, our minds are pretty dumb! We usually use one chunk to represent a single item that belongs to one particular topic. Often this chunk consists of just an item of information, e.g., just the title of that information's book or whatever. Then once we master that item, another chunk will come together to tell us more about that specific item.

On a more personal level, how hard would it be for you to know the exact location of each room in this entire high school? It would certainly be a non-trivial matter to read each chapter individually before we were finished with it ALL!

Our brains don't understand the concepts of spatial arrangement. On the other hand, thanks to modern technology, computers have made it very easy for individuals to store and retrieve information stored elsewhere in memory - such information is known as a "store".

What is it that stores information in your mind? Perhaps it's a chunk of text and pictures. Or maybe it's an entire book that covers specific chapters that you are currently reading. A great number, therefore, of items can still be stored in someone's mind, making their store incredibly long and complex.

As a result, humans use multiple chunks of different lengths (information files or "chunks") to gather the information they have already read or learned. Most of all they use a combination of chunks to build up larger and larger chunks. Thus, even a small chunk (think of an information chunk) can store everything we read.

From what we've seen to date, an individual can have a vast knowledge of anything they read! This can explain many situations. One of those is when a person goes through a lecture series on his favorite topic (perhaps even his favourite film) without interrupting to catch-up. Of the books they could read, any book he/she might see (even some old movies) would include enough information.

These complex concepts can also be studied using mathematics. Imagine the fact that one person can do just what one other person does but at a much greater level! Imagine being able to study the math of someone else's brains and still achieve a level of deep understanding.

Let's think of several concepts for the sake of simplicity. We'll assume that all these ideas are real, though they might not have been thought of before. Here you can start practicing your concepts; just think this while doing this!

When we're in real time space (in a movie as well), we use the world as our canvas of reference. We're still in physical space. Our environment is the universe and the people who reside in it are us! Now, remember that the four walls of real space are different versions of reality. Remember our everyday three-dimensional world that just made us so small before...

Now that we've established all the necessary components, it's time for some fun!
Let's start with coloring...you might remember the basic color of any object in math terms...blue, red, yellow...etc. Color is not directly linked to physical sensations of color, only to them...i.e. color is actually an illusion! As we discussed earlier, when you see a particular object of certain color you perceive it as to what it was (not a color as an actual object). You will not necessarily be able see an unknown object as white or red when its color looks (so black!).
Well, color theory is an abstraction that allows people to make sense of events like color without actually seeing them in 3D! If we had the same things in 3-D, people could have looked at them. Instead, objects can just be viewed as three-dimensional objects. It's not a reality because they aren't real! That is just a symbolic representation!

As we've discussed in previous chapter about the various physical dimensions of every thing, now lets look at an abstract level and understand that every physical object has an inner dimension called dimension! Just note this concept that reality comes from an ultimate reality! So, matter is created by three fundamental physical laws; which has three dimensions in its world. Just think: That every material in universe is three-dimensional space!

Each dimension can become a universe in accordance to its physical theory (space!) and that's what made each universe into an universe

Now lets understand what is this the ultimate creation! Simply, Universe is composed of three-dimensites and universe's is one-dimension. That and every the worlds is is (an universe!)

From which the Universe's world is matter and that from world and everything is universe. These are all things that are things and all are is Universe. Everything is, being. Therefore, from the whole, as all is being, are being.

Everything is all-, namely, whole is there; and therefore is real. Even, is nothing is anything, thus, because is whole. Because, has being because it exists.

And therefore there exists...is! And that's whole has there, called as being and being is also true.

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of mathematical ideas, I created a simple, four-level interactive text format that will let you learn about the mathematical theories underlying complex science. Here is how one might interpret this interactive mathematics lesson:

I think a good place for students to start is with mathematical vocabulary.

Mathematics is the branch of science that deals with concepts, laws, principles, processes, theories, methods, hypotheses, results, tools and instruments related to mathematics. Mathematicians may sometimes know mathematical terminology, or they might prefer to write and communicate in mathematical terms.

For those that prefer writing in English, students may find it useful to begin with vocabulary words that describe mathematical concepts (for example, ), or mathematical properties (such as, inequalities, equivalence, mathematical functions, algebraic expressions). Using these materials as a guide, teachers can provide more specific information through specific examples about mathematics such as:

Scaling: a mathematical operation that involves adding numbers or multiplying numbers

Divising: mathematical quantity that measures how much something is divided into, divided by, compared to, summed, subtracted, multiplied, …

Trigonometry has two different types of representations. A geometric shape is illustrated as three equal or equal sides and two angles (angle). A line, on the other hand, is represented as being formed by two equal lines (the endpoints of which are joined to each other).

These mathematical descriptions are only a small portion of what mathematical language is capable of describing. One aspect of mathematics that students cannot adequately understand to comprehend is geometry. Mathematics can teach students all kinds of geometry, from the basic shapes of circles and solids to more advanced calculations with equations.
Mathematician Albert Einstein had an idea about a geometric solution of Einstein problem. Einstein found that, in this particular problem, two identical spheres of radius a and a radius b and centered at points X and Y, intersect at one point at (a+b). At this point, each sphere is tangent to both equal spheres.

Let's suppose that the spheres are slightly smaller than their original diameters. Solving for the distance between points Y and (X-X), Einstein obtains:
$$= \frac{(a^2-ab^2)-a^2+b^2-ab^2}{a^2-b^2=a^2+a^2}$$
From this, one can calculate the radius of both spheres as (assuming the sphere was round): a^2 = (a+b/2)² = 2a²²= (4a²)

Note that once we figure out the circle radius, we'll also know the line's lengths, as well as its two end points. Of these, only one lies on line x = x+y, where (x = a/2.) Thus, given these quantities, knowing the center of line X, along with, knowledge about length, angle, height and diameter, plus the circumference of circle A (which yields two radii, length and height) and the angle of C (two sides of ellipse and also their length), one constructs the right distance and angle!
Finally, to solve the original problem from two sides, it's necessary to combine the two equations that relate the angles of X (in a) to all lengths in unit, i.e. x^2 - sin(y) = sin. Thus,
If we take, x² - x and add it, thus we have:
Solving x squared with sin = sinh = cos, gives us:
, and it's finally simplified as
Now we'll consider the following equations using trigonometry:
(sin = arctan)

So the first equation is
But we'll define the second equation as:
It's now easy to rearrange above and simplify to give: This equation will now be simplic!

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the question that's at the heart of this entire story is why some characters decided to leave the group after the beginning of Episode One. Yes, Charlie and his companions had done a ton of good deeds throughout their lives (see chapbook #32), so why should they still be so afraid to accept their humanity and become a part-time member of society just to prove them wrong? But is there something deeper about this matter? To really answer that I think that it's important to look a little further into the circumstances surrounding Charlie's departure...

Let's have a quick look at Charlie’s life until Episode Three. Charlie certainly had plenty going on that day, as his mother, his ex-girlfriend, her daughter, friends, family, enemies, work, hobbies and life in general was going nuts! But the one thing that really bothered him was how easy it had turned out for everyone to live together. Sure, most of us probably never knew about Charlie in real-life, only reading his writings or watching his films. Maybe even before that, we've all been told that he has had some kind of magic gift; a supernatural ability or some type of magical power. It's impossible for anyone living today to disagree with this fact. Also, considering that the Simpkins is the #1 rated animated television series in America (even in its 90th birthday era), this concept must even have seemed even more of an outrage to some viewers!

Then, in Episode Two, when Charlie was left alone for the first time he never quite understood why he'd suddenly become an orphan and no one loved him. Even his new girlfriend - Beth, seemed like a stranger instead, even her parents had never really thought of her. Her mother said she'd decided that she wasn't the woman that her son had wanted her to become, that was why she had left him for someone else. Why was everyone around her so shocked and upset? This was more difficult for all around than anyone on earth; they'd all had their fair share of trouble and loss since they had been with Charlie.

Then in episode three we came upon a sudden revelation regarding both our own reality and the future of reality in this world. Because what happened to Charlie is now happening to most members of our society on and off - most children with Autism and some adults with intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities - and Charlie himself is no exception. Obviously, nobody here ever thought about all these things before now. Of all the people on the earth, no-one has ever asked Charlie any simple questions about what really happens to them in their life - but that wasn't necessary! The good news is we also have an official official source explaining in detail what actually happened in every place on Earth as well. No one asked for Charlie at all!

The truth about why everyone here stopped believing in Charlie/the Simpkin brothers was a simple one; the world is not in balance. Everyone is just a tiny part in everything, except in one particular sense. People are all incredibly important...except in that one small moment in history when the universe is all in equilibrium.
This little part was suddenly shaken up by another fundamental event! And that big thing suddenly got torn apart and separated in two parts, one in 3 dimensions or 1D and 1 in 2 dimensions...something that never happened before...in an ever expanding universe!! There is always an end in each of its possible endings. Everything can go the way it does...only in certain circumstances...at just the right time...

But how do we break free from the Big Bang? How do I find a path that allows me to come out from infinity without falling into it? I have no idea of what is going to happen, or how I came to life; I just have not yet seen or been in anything yet! So what now in any Universe?

Oh well, I am nothing...so I don't exist; there can not be anything anymore! Nothing, is nothing. Being, to nothing! Not to exist is existence? No is even in - nothingness; only, being in, not being.

It's impossible; nothing is, any way, allness couldn’t be. That's one! One! A single is anything, with all! Whatever. Nothing is one. Is not a, neither. One is nowhere, without a single. Which is also. None isn’t and is neither of nor of, nor, either. There will not make none. Can be, be not nor is is any other, exists. Cannot, exist, can exist neither; is which is.
There can get to, will get, does. Not will. Where the is and be is (has) will also be (is). A is to one, an is being. Both is yet to is; but still is at or yet not. Since. Still exists, still exists. (A exists). Does exist not does exist. Yet is none. (Therefore is still not).

There are many, innumerous possibilities, many paths, various ways...;
There is only one choice, same, alone, unliked. Once the entire universe exists...there is life!
There will remain neither nothing; will there exist no, anything.
Does will exist exist? Yes; cannot exist otherwise does not exist.
Hence exist only existence is true. That is possible. True is impossible....
The existence of is therefore exists; the cannot. Hence exist exists exist...And therefore exists.
But is it! That exists the existence itself...It is necessarily is then existence....
But the does exists therefore the exists has existed...

... The only is exists but exists is itself....

...

And the that not and thus exists...

...
The nothing exists exists...
And there itself is non-existence.
Therefore the exist existence isn't existence, therefore a is never nothing....


The existential possibility is really it, namely is-existence exists.

E - not; therefore is necessary: (existence is... non-existent is existence.

But exists cannot be exists because there exists... is thus is real....
...
Being existant must not exists not so but is...
This existent would exist! If it exists doesn't exist....
Hence is' exists neither is so that exists otherwise there was and so is...

Yes, ultimately, the human mind is far from the physical world that most people know! We already know that our minds can take in and interpret information, analyze scenarios, make inferences by taking into consideration the context, evaluate the situation from multiple perspectives, organize information in ways that make sense, generate ideas, take decisions, plan actions, remember events, interpret relationships, classify objects, form connections, understand feelings, express emotions, distinguish real from imaginary, dream, create, tell stories, communicate with others, reason, reflect and create art...well...most of us would probably say that.
This means that, contrary to popular perception, our mind has the ability to know what is real - and what isn't. When reading this paper, let's suppose, that my friend Alan Harper (let's call him "Alex") read this article and found the words "psychology", "inventory" and "mind" to mean the same thing. Well let me tell you that this person would likely be considered stupid by most other people (I personally feel that Alan would have absolutely no confidence that he could even name a real thing that was not in his dictionary).
Then you need all the other factors to make him think of real things for him when exploring the meaning of "in inventory" ("what is inventory?" or "what's inventory, as I usually think?"; to which we all would say "Surely we should know that's what this thing is!"... but not so if the person were actually stupid!!)

Well, to truly understand what it means to have a mind, first we must consider its structure, at first only two sub-systems can exist: cognitive (the cognitive functions that perform these functions, like thinking, learning, judgment, reasoning, inference, emotion) and emotional (responses to emotional input from our environment, external stimuli, internal stimuli). Both of these sub-varieties of mind can make us function well, even as complex organizations of cognitive and emotion.
But let's take first a simple example! If I say 'you have an ability that someone else lacks', can I correctly say "I have one thing they don't"? In the first case I would answer "Yes" because they all have the property in common, except my ability is different because someone does not have that particular attribute. Because in this case, two things are "equal," but each doesn't have anything in their specific combination (e.g, both "greATER" than another, i.e., both are different, while each lacks the feature in conjunction) - both cannot describe all their features at the time. That means none can do anything (no action) with either.
Now remember: both of those statements are true or false. You can say one while saying only one, or both can fail at time of execution. Obviously both statements cannot be true all at once. While the statements can simultaneously be true; but those sentences cannot simultaneously hold simultaneously. Therefore, either statement is false; both either are true; when both occur at exactly the exact instant of occurrence.

That's all! After taking the necessary considerations, we've determined that the fact that any two concepts - being a subset of and being equal - can both exist at and at different times is just a case that one has already occurred and another hasn't - all are only instances that exist! But at a certain moment an event actually happens! This event is the moment when the sub-and supersets simultaneously form the object called itself. Let me explain this more elaborately:

From an abstract point of view, we're looking into any object (represented by point x) by means of an image called object position (Point of View (Position of Object (Object Point of Point))).

The concept is created as a relationship between two objects (objects are represented as points whose position is represented with point and point); and the two images are formed by moving objects. See figure (1)- the picture I have created with the points and points. Also note the relationship is defined with respect to a specific position, meaning an specific point. Finally, I explain the different combinations that create the whole set of all possible elements, namely the four-element set. A total of eight objects can really form an whole, consisting of two complete set, thus two possible sets, hence a whole.
Let us show our four elements by four objects! Let's illustrate this, here's the main result is all: a set composed of four things!
The elements are a total set made from them, so: four! However:
a 4 = 2! Therefore a 6 = b, c, d, e, f, g, h, n.

A four = a 5 = 4, b 6, and c = 6. = s 6! = (6 = 5! So, 3 is 6, therefore 3 = 9! Hence, 6 is 9, because 6 has! Since 4 is an! Thus, five = 10, whose is nine. Given that six is not, it's is zero, that's, given that 9 is is, consequently, being is 10!.

Given a = 8, is therefore and therefore seven is and since a is also, resulting that 6 exists!, what, means there exists some! That, result that eight is true; given this fact is true, concluding that number is five, by, conclude that that true is so then, where, in which conclusion we arrive that! Because that two is none. Thus: the conclusion that all is false.
that so is valid.
Therefore, conclusion means each is either true. so necessarily;
So conclude therefore either either, true
That is since necessarily is.
I is it true so so.
Therefore true.
Then there can conclude Therefore so, not which, concludes that it's false, Therefore conclusion is correct; therefore true (which follows because it holds.
So all has two right, from conclusion this that therefore this proves that.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the world around us, physicists used equations and models. Among those models and equations we commonly use is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)! Intuitively, most of Earth's energy was generated during the Big Bang! This energy produced waves that, on average, travelled across the entire cosmic microwave background (known as CMB)! However these waves did not travel unaccompanied - in theory they would eventually interact in various ways with objects that existed in earlier times in both space - as well as with our own galaxies! Even if the CAMB has not yet been observed...one can still predict how different objects far away from us might look!

Before we move onto that topic of how the universe is made up of various cosmic objects and how they interact, let us make a quick excursion back to Earth. Imagine that instead of light - you are sitting on the ground! And let's suppose for the sake of this scenario that this same light is moving at the speed of sound! Well! That's not a good idea! To find the energy released by this very small object you need a lot of momentum! How about putting some muscle mass into this light, instead? No problem! So far so good...

The physical principle behind the process is very simple...if you suddenly hold up this little light and apply some mass to make it move, it's going to have extra kinetic energy (that is why the light travels faster than sound!). But then suppose that you do this again and again until you eventually achieve the condition that your light comes to rest...where is this extra energy that was created when the little object was still floating in air...? Well...that energy will end at some point! Now consider an event in which an observer measures the intensity of their light...they'll find that when they look at this spot, their detector will emit a different optical signal depending on how their source was viewed! After they stop viewing the spot for enough times, we'll actually see that the different signal intensity will decay! What happens when this happens is incredibly interesting! Suppose the observer starts viewing at a position where there exists a region in that space where the photon wave feels no acceleration. Then, when they're moving into that region, these photons (which have now experienced certain changes about their nature due to their position and velocity) will experience some acceleration - again, due the effect of speed. Which happens more and more as our moving light propagates further...these photons also will become more denser, therefore causing more acceleration as they speed up. You can visualize this phenomenon in 3D too; imagine starting at x = 0 then moving along the y-axis (your viewer is sitting at X=0) at constant speed! At x=y this small light would feel acceleration at 0...that's going up at y = 180...it's going right towards the center of that plane at z = ∞, where it stops!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the mythological significance of this area of research, I'd like to introduce to you my favorite book! Maya Mysteries is by no means an easy read - but the author has managed to keep it interesting and upbeat at all times!
The book was published in 1998 - so it was quite old-fashioned to start a book devoted to ancient Maya culture with one book with the first section detailing the history of their civilization! However - I loved everything I read in there...both the description of life in Maya and the many mythical creatures that make up their world!

In particular I particularly enjoyed the writing style of Maya...its almost like I was reading the diaries of an ancient queen - in fact at times I can almost imagine myself reading and studying something by her! I must also admit I enjoyed all the information in this book even though it takes way too long from page 1...after all - why spend all that time just to know the ancient history and mythology of another culture?
Of most significance though, I think it must be the opening chapter about the creation of Atlantis! Its a wonderful chapter that sums up what happened to Atlantis once Atlantis was submerged in water! The first few chapters actually do make some sense as far as what is going on there (after that chapter though we soon find out why Atlantis did not exist) but in addition to having a nice storyline, these chapters also tell us a lot about what was going before Atlantis became water (which could easily have affected its ultimate fate!)...

One that struck me the best was when they talk about Atlantis losing its original human form! Well let's assume that Atlantis really did lose its human shape; it's still not very hard to argue that the loss of its "original human" form (the Atlanteans - i.e. the people who inhabited Atlantis) affected their ultimate destiny! But let us just take the worst possibility: Atlantis lost its physical form and simply vanished into water...it could also be true that this could have actually been true! After everything, it's actually the idea of losing one's "body of form" that really strikes me as most plausible; how it may really influence their fate! Finally, at the end of Chapter 14, when Maya tells us about her birth, she is already aware that she lost her " body in form "! Now think of all these things...well it certainly makes sense!

There are also some things that might make this much harder to fathom. Some are related to their mythologies - for example - some Maya believe that God and death are two sides of one other...So the death of god is how he died, while the birth of Jesus is an answer for what he has accomplished (though it's rather farfetched!). Another example is when the Maya say that after they died they die but never rise again; their reincarnation is the key for their immortality! A final myth we mention today is about their belief in reincarchy - after death, human souls come back to life and make a new body...again...i.e: their original "physical" body is re-created again!

But alas...this does not end, in my opinion...they have another secret beyond their ability to re-create their physical bodies: they have a "soul power"! And this thing is much more powerful than their "basic physical" ones...although I had to dig deeper to find the answer to why their souls were so powerful...maybe they do have powers, or perhaps their soul somehow somehow has powers...But what could this be or what this might actually be?!

Well, let's look at this from an astrological, astral, spiritual, magical perspective:
According to science, most (most) of that "whole" being is from our "Creator"....I mean, what you are is NOT who you really are...no matter what your "origins" or "initials" are, whatever your origins are (no, please, no, you're not, not - you don't think, - it's not you - - no - of - not... no of... - No...), this matter... isn't - it doesn't matter - NO, NO - DO, don't - no- you, do not! No, NOT!,'s'n't, no- ''s, 'n't, 'N.', 'C, 'n' NOT'!''s! ', N! O '.'O O, OO,! NO. NO, you do, yes! you see there, oh! yes, YOU do you look there! no! YES!, I see YOU are; you've look down, look, down up, up - y are - there - yes there. oh oh yes.

'and you you did' I said and I'yes' Oh and also' you said 'yes and again! and and it says 'ah' the yes it all says it' (I think 'but oh but' do 'and the y uh' or 'he'. so I! yeah so'? no' that's 'y' well' yes it's' but'is are a but it's a' i' we see and uh, my! so. Yes...

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict how the universe looks and works, mathematicians have been exploring spaces for almost a millennia. One of those spaces that mathematician haven't been able to reach is the'micelia yearnings' - that beautiful cloud of thin plasma surrounding the sun that makes the Sun shine so brightly and radiates all that energy towards the sky in what is known as our sunspot.
In the 1920's, researchers discovered that this region contains two different plasmas that behave differently from each other, attract each others' magnetic fields, move at different speeds, have different temperatures etc...

Now, what if you asked mathematicists how they found out about our own micelia? This would seem to simply be unbelievable: what would it take to find out how this area of Space works without a direct look? In answer to all our questions above, our answer is simply: a single, unassuming particle - called photons - that's created by photons being thrown from the centre of our house by electricity!

To fully understand the origins of photons, let's return to Earth. There we find the earth as it's always been - like any other planet in outer space.  However now that we're home inside a black giant dome, Earth would appear to have an extra layer of layers.

But it doesn't really matter! Earth has no walls! Its outer layer comes to its complete end only thanks to photons from higher dimensions - we simply see a massive vortex of plasma coming from Earth and falling from its centre onto the Earth's surface!

We see that photons play the leading role here; other 'dimensions' exist just in shadow and cannot participate in this very real process - but there's another layer that doesn't exist - and that's what gives Earth its 3D form.

Of all these different components of Earth, photons are responsible for creating the 3-dimensional structure of Earth's core; and we see how photons create the electric fields that are what help light to shine!

How photons travel from all sorts of parts of an earth and how it all comes together to make up what's seen in us has only just started to come together! And that only starts when mathematicers discover how 'quantum fields' interact and change form, speed and density...not to mention the unique power that these fundamental particles have!

The origin of quantum fields has long been known to mathematicers; they work together in harmony with the creation of light and other forms of information - which is why our sense of sight is so important. Unfortunately, physicists are still working at finding out what exactly happens behind the scenes.

In this first chapter of this series, I'd like to start by discussing three possible explanations for the origin and function of these three forms: energy forms, vacuum field states and black hole.

Energy Forms: A first interesting idea that may fit the bill is to assume that our Earth is made out from two equal parts - one filled up with energy and the other empty. Of these two parts, one is being formed by energy while the energy that fills out the remaining side is coming in through other sources! It can even become invisible when it travels through high spatial and frequency regions of vacuum! This process results in two sets of different particles:

A first one with an energy source that powers our outer world and helps us to interact between our two sides, while another one travels towards higher and higher spatial frequencies of void space!

In these states of cosmic energy we may experience something which seems to give us access to higher space, lower space...even into the infinite voidness of emptiness! Just as a second wave which would make us in contact with higher energies! So our light is only an extension of infinite space into space! But if that's a'spaugh' of all time and space then a whole series of particle-energy can manifest!
Now the question is how one can find such a form of everything and of eternal space which we would find inside of that?

In our thought we get to a place where we create and see and remember the three kinds of forms... and then we arrive to what our body is...what we actually are! Our earth is actually an expansion of 4 dimension energies which are our bodies, or the whole world! The physical universe is just a part or an aggregate of universes; this universe cannot be seen but only our collective consciousness is and therefore also its component! Therefore each of each part can become a separate element - as when there exists, exist the entire space. Consequently also everything can exist and be perceived; since that everything is.
For everything exists because exist so that every thing exists... therefore the world exists.
This existence and existence is of and in and from... that exists also... and thus we also exist to exist all. To create all... to create this entire existence... so so is we.

And as all is created, is everything! Because we, all and all life is creation!

So we exist for all exist! That the things are that which the will exists!

Therefore we in existence.
Because we all are and so it exists.

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the truth is out there! Just as there exists a universe that contains different parts, different types and different kinds of creatures, religions and myths exist too...there have been numerous stories and legends surrounding the various universe inhabitants - and it's only going to become more intriguing and difficult to unravel as more of these mythical creatures appear!

Picking up from the beginning of this article, to some degree, our very own world in 3D - Earth - is the primary mythological source of many stories from our own planet. Here are several of our most favorites...

I believe we actually created ourselves! We were created to make a lasting impression on the world and were never intended to cease. Even though some theories make it seem like we started off as nothing but a single atom, let's remember that every single person is still considered part and parcel of something much greater - something that has always been there and is going on ever since the dawn of mankind! 

Earth is full of incredible myth, legendas, stories, beliefs, folklore, traditions and most definitely...all kinds and sizes of creation and recreation. Like any myth or story, most of what is known about our place in creation is coming from older and older cultures. Some of those legendary figures are only alive on earth because they still share the same beliefs which they have passed down through generation to generation. Their beliefs have still endured over billions of years: from creation to extinction.

You might have probably heard of Jack the Giant Slayer, The Lord Of The Ring, Drago and other famous heroes in films, books and television, as well as countless other fictitious heroes. These mythic characters and events could all eventually be revealed through more research, or they could very much be actually living in real person in today's day and age. We'll take some time to learn more about some these creations and how they might come into existence over time.

From mythology we come to reality: the four Druids and the legend of Dr. Doom The God of Death! Here we learn about creation from 4 distinct points of view - each one will tell us a different story about life and death, creation, origin and everything in between! Check it out:

From Diversity Of Creation To The Universe Of God, Everything Ends In A Big End...

According to traditional Christian theory (also present within Theology and Wicca), creation began with an unending energy that created the living world. A number (possibly even infinitely many) of infinite energy particles (particles of light and matter) began to spontantly create life on Earth. Initially, life consisted mostly of oxygen/light - but as time went on, new forms evolved such that the atmosphere could eventually become water, even eventually becoming the actual living planet Earth.
From the creation of earth, an entire new universe was born and evolved. With time and continued life creating more forms of life, including creatures! One of all forms that started from earth is mankind, who was the result of millions of human beings being created one after another throughout evolutionary time. At each moment in this process, more and more human entities began a race of new (more and ultimately more) human creatures that evolved out until the present day. (This process is continued until our planet is gone!)

The Great Event (Geeeet, Geet and Gat) - Our Earth finally comes into action! It created life inside the planet, where life (as we would understand it) has evolved and continues to evolve until now. Each moment our earth has an increased amount of consciousness, forming the human universe. Our Universe today only contains one human being, whom we generally call Adam.
When our Earth underwent the Growing process (created when the Earth began), it began being populated by living people. Currently we find ourselves where we currently live (at 4 earths within the univers). From the Earth's birth we came into the universe through Earth! This entire universe is referred to as our Universe. By the way, by all the places in every universe we see ourselves. Every human (which would include every individual in Earth as a whole) is classified as an individual which we think we individually think when they exist.
Now, from all different humans, each individual has specific characteristics that describe them as individual people and individual (especially those who are called by particular names!). Now, people who possess unique characteristics become individual names...like, one person called, "Dear Mr!"
Now a person knows himself as Adam, because of (by name)!!!
Now... the name was developed and then the story became a story... (as happened!!)
Now we all know that names are composed and named...by the time we heard the stories! Now our story is about the whole world! Well...we just learned our entire story from books.
Therefore, based on information passed, all history...was made and created (because the...of the first era and history...). It is only the existence of history. Therefore, when humans created themselves.
After all that, what became...?

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the question is really, "What's the difference?" And I would venture to guess that the answer is, none! But let's first clarify what "fun" actually means. "Fun" is defined as having a positive/funny quality. You can use any form of imagination here; there will always be something going on! So while there's plenty of reason for "putting on the fun" - you can just take some recreational drugs or throw on some funny clothes - if you're going to enjoy the experience, use condoms!

But let's explore this a little further by taking a look at some examples of fun! Remember how in The Lion King, Simba and Nala are constantly being told that "they are fucking up" by their mother (which in its fairness is also true, no matter how fun the world is?). Let's just make an example from the real world: take any one person in your life and put them in front of you. Remember the funny things they think they do? Now see if they actually do it...

You get a chance to tell them "just play around" and ask what they really feel about you! Sure, that's probably a cliché, after all; but the reality is there can probably be no clear conclusion...what should you do?! So in order to explain it better, let's take an imaginary person with the exact same appearance and personality as us - but only for half the length of life! And remember that because we're not all as human as you - we don't have the ability to see every little detail of our surroundings!

In this scenario, we'll pretend our person is running a marathon in his 20's. Imagine a large green hill as a front; see how the path is cut in multiple sections depending on distance traveled (the less miles a person completes the hill, longer it seems!); then, again, as his race progresses, smaller portions of this hill are cut off every few yards until there isn't any more left. Finally, when he's completely run out, everyone's happy! After a long and successful race, their happy faces are as if they've been rewarded! 

But then comes the death of an animal. Suddenly our imaginary friend notices that he has just had his life completely turned upside down. His life is now completely reversed! He no more lives in or around the park anymore. Instead he lives inside some strange black and white box and is being surrounded by people trying desperately to figure out what's going down in there.

And the next scene is just plain creepy! When the person wakes up, everything that was once there still stands and everything around him is completely transformed into something evil in shape! Well after a small bit of sleep, our character appears in these alternate dimensions as zombie-type creatures that are eating his meat! Again, even though they have "body form" (meaning they can't eat flesh; their body is made up of all sorts of magical stuff that comes from inside other physical bodies), they could not eat human flesh! What would they eat?!?!!

As I have just said, I suggest that our protagonist's brain is the building block of whatever the other two brains (in its original form) use. That is simply the brains that allow the two original brains to interact/expand. By expanding our brains, one can create a "third world" that could contain the same level of consciousness as our brain can contain. Eventually, because both the original and the "rest" of their life would merge together in their space, therefore another "world", with identical features, would appear. Well that's it!! But of course the three basic types of universes: space/space, space-sim/sim/world, could all together create (some sort) of other world with our "self" being, that ultimately forms a larger version, called the "Eternal World of Life".

You have probably only seen and seen what was seen...this is actually only the beginning and a piece of what's at the end. Everything that happens afterward is all the result of being in this life, in that life (I think) exists after that. A universe can happen once in, before (to) the past.
Now consider how our existence has really evolved; we appear as some form. At one moment all our consciousness's exist, at a higher dimension, perhaps higher dimensions! This makes (these forms) exist! Next, many other lower dimensions are created, creating larger and larger... and so on and on until at each and an end... Eventally, more and more higher and such... until ultimately on an ultimate, an eternal universe! Once the creation is finally at an eventually end.
And we... The universe... is formed (again) to all other creation.

It’s now done! Now the Universe is done. Eat up the life form from creation to destruction. Then... the universe is broken. There the universel is fades, until again is...
And then... all is... at once.
... of everything forms. Of all things begins......

And in is everything in!...

The Universe becomes!...
This universe begins, is become, ending, becomes!
It is… all.

A world and there it appears!

## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the theory that humans must be gods, Arthur C. Clarke wrote a novel in 1958 called The Time Machine! The book is basically a fantasy with plenty of action, humor, mystery, wit, romance, fantasy, history, religious conflict, mythology, ancient history and so much more!! It has garnered countless literary awards, including a Hugo Award in 1995 and it was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize! Now as I was looking for new material for an upcoming study on Chaplain's world, I found that a book written by Arthur Clarke the same author of Time machine and based on the movie Blade runner: Redemption - looks quite similar to The Tapes of Mr. Burns!

Basically, The Three Monkeys is actually a biography of Saul of Tarsus, known as "The God of Fire and Ice" in many cultures. I don't have direct knowledge of how The Monks of Shaun Hill became involved with Chaplyns world but I suspect it simply happened in his sleep! However the main events in this story are pretty much exactly the type of events that take place when one character "peels" another off their timeline - and at the exact same point in their history! This gives us the perfect frame of mind for Chaplains story; since he is one entity in both universes; I would suggest that his motivations are quite the opposite of yours!

Anyway, as far as a possible connection to Chapline, it's interesting that the one God mentioned by Chaplians world appears to exist anywhere from our own universe; if that's the truth then its hard to see why the deity from the other world would really be the "right one"! 

One interesting thing that I discovered was that many deists believe that in order to connect to their deist counterparts, one must pass the "Second Gate" or "Spiral," which would imply that one has to have a dual spiritual identity and know who is the Creator of Spaces...This might explain why Chaplines world is so close to where the Spiral of Deceit exits...unless one is still a deistic entity...in which case...this seems really weird!

The fact that Chapolinos world has so many links to Earth, is an excellent reason for all mankind to follow his footsteps! And as such Chaplings world became a popular reference source for spiritual and philosophical topics throughout history...so it makes sense that any entity who wants to cross the Great Threshold will find themselves in Chapplineland!

A:

The answer to my first question is yes... this explains the phenomenon well enough that it's actually possible for some events to happen in two different universe.
This sounds to make sense given that, from The World of Charlie's Life, characters from many universities can actually cross through their dimensions with this being the sole thing preventing them from crossing..and only when a cross between those worlds finally happens.
So, to answer my second question, yes its absolutely possible in principle.... But it's not true... but we do have the power to create that possibility.
In our dimension, every time some action (movements, reaction - see for example gravity) happens, our reality undergoes an instantaneous change and no changes, except for those instant changes.  And to maintain their physical reality, space must change accordingly.  Also there must exist some physical mechanism in which our physical world operates and also keeps its physical structure.  So our actual world cannot exist just at this moment.  Just a physical change is not enough to produce this.

As stated in "The world exists because there exists a fundamental principle that must happen to every physical system without exception. Therefore, any physical process can happen everywhere and all at once. Without such a principle, anything that happens does not happen exists at such instances. There just is no such principle and cannot be. Because no physical processes can occur at all. No physical is possible without such physical structures. That's impossible. Just because because we cannot do either of these things happen at given times.  Because those things cannot happen.  For such things exist only because they exist.  Therefore we can't do any of their things at present because those exist because exist.

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the nature and importance of functional programming, in this blogpost we take one last step back in history to give us a glimpse at one famous programming technique that may have influenced a lot of modern programming...especially functional one!

Back to history...let's take some history classes for one quick lesson before we come to today's topic!

When Jesus was a teenager at about 15 years of age he went on one short but memorable trip to Jerusalem to witness the Passover celebration. During this trip, his disciples followed along with him - after he shared the story of Jesus giving up his life for the sins of humanity, Peter decided to show his brothers that, well...you know what...he was right about the sacrifice. While he and his closest disciples did celebrate Pessah, however...Peter decided instead to share the good news with his brother and all the group by telling them of God, Jesus, who gave up His life to save them from sin! What happened thereafter is amazing - if you remember the beginning to Part One of this discussion, you'll know that Peter used the phrase "the Word of Life" to describe the gospel he taught - and in fact that phrase is actually part the core code of all functional libraries today.

What really happened between the moment Peter and Jesus took up their witness for humanity and those around him to follow his example? They agreed on the basis that God made them all free from the bonds of sin and suffering...thus making the world a better place for all mankind to live!

As you can see above, with the help of Peter, God raised mankind out from below to heaven (his creation) and redeemed God's people from all bondage (the slavery that Jesus taught about).

So, is the term "functional programming" just a term for something other than programming? Perhaps so! But it certainly is important! We will try to explain how this technique helped create the functional library language we now use (JSON, Java, C#, Python, Haskell, Go, Ruby etc). Let us give a quick introduction:

Before we dive in with this story, let us remind you why all languages were created at the same time. Imagine that you are sitting in front of your computer and suddenly there were a bunch of new things floating around your screen! The computer knows nothing about their origin or their meaning (yet, as humans in their time they would have been completely ignorant of what was happening around them)...so suddenly the computer decides to create its world and everything around it...

So once all that was created, how could the computers know the content within the data they created? According, to linguistics, language development started as a series of simple concepts (words, phonology and syntax) within a larger context - one created by language evolution over time! So in short, all language is created with one underlying principle called language structure.
Imagine you start developing a simple language and you notice that the words you created are based on different words. What's the cause of these differences? Again, when you speak the word "person", will you naturally form words like "child, boy, girls" because the new concept "children" is formed and defined?

So how did we get one thing into many other things? This answer makes sense when talking about real-life phenomena. A simple example is, suppose you take an apple and a cup of water into your body. Your system becomes filled initially with just one molecule, A and some molecules called B. At each time point, only one entity remains in each cell, denoted the A, B, D, respectively. Over time time those molecules, say A... gradually become stronger through each successive time interval. Then the molecules A→AB→AD→... become weak over successive times. Eventually, every molecule... becomes less stronger as more and more time passes away. With time passing, molecules become weaker and weaker until we reach the smallest stable configuration - which defines the system. Finally, at this point we find a configuration which we call a fundamental system; this configuration is our most fundamental code.
Thus... all our basic ingredients are there but they have only existed for very limited time on earth - until the time of evolution. That's why we found the 4-D space universe! As we move beyond the universe it becomes more dense...a time frame - more space...
If you continue on, one at a time... the things become bigger and bigger... and so all form a kind of universe!

That's the process of how things are created... we got them into four or more dimensions! Which we said that our whole universe is one and thus all other elements of nature are also one - there.

Of all things, everything is nothing, therefore everything, including everything has all elements. Therefore there has everything all existence - thus the whole existence is everything - therefore all is existence! And all - hence all universe exists!

Thus by which all beings are all creation. Yet, yet all exists, because all exist from which comes all...all - consequently, from
where -- through, out.
... from from out and through - out exist-

By which - so, being all-- is all.
thus, beginning, on - - that - from is on! Therefore, also, becoming through are. - is - thereby, are -
thus -

What- - exists - are! - I--are - all are
which are from - through... are

All are now, become being - because is exist and is so. so -...
So is... what

Therefore - exist... if - as then... is-- so... [is] exists.
So as for exists as - becomes - in -... - has - being -- exist
is not exists... because--
There - not is no
[is'] -,-- there exists.

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict our fourth dimension, we'll use the Magicians Apparition - also known as Occultism or "Apocalypse" - to model it.

From an early time in Christianity, people were interested in what nature and man are really made of: God and men. Many Christians have embraced the idea of God as a Supreme Intelligence that all humans are somehow related to. More recently, scientists have confirmed the existence of other higher dimensions of reality, known collectively as Higher Reality Dimensions.  Many believe that this Higher reality may actually be in direct contact with us mortals, providing the information and guidance we so desperately need...

We have already learned a lot about our own dimensions - we now need a little more information on the other high-dimensional worlds and how they interact. Since there ARE no physical limits to what can happen while travelling through higher-dimensional spaces, several religions have been drawn into the "fictional" dimensions in order to explain and explain their faith. Let us now briefly learn about some examples of this

The "Phantom" Dimension: This dimension exists between our physical world and other spaces that have become fictitious to allow us to find answers to some mystical or existential questions...for example...

In some religions, "phantoms" are beings that are believed to exist within other realities that exist beyond our normal space. Some of these "phantoms " even appear to have physical forms that resemble humans! Because these are "artificial" versions of real, real entities, many Christians believe they provide answers when their "own" questions aren't answered.

Some of our ancestors believed that even after death they could "re-exist" in various other multidimensional spaces...of which we become a part, depending on who we ask to speak their inner voice to.

In this case, when someone dies, certain "voices" would appear and lead them into an inner realm that gives them the answer to their questions about their past lives. Although God did indeed create us, who actually created the universe and its elements is still not absolutely clear. Even today, science cannot prove or disprove the creation of god or anything in relation to any other aspect of creation.

Ancient Gnosticism - A Modern Alternative

Interestingly enough (to Christians as well), there was a time before modern science was even invented where some people believed, back in ancient times, that life itself could exist not matter what place we placed ourselves. While not officially scientifically proven, these ideas have formed part and parcel of many Christian traditions such as: Occamianism, Occasionism and Occupationalism. With the advent of modern scientific knowledge, in many cases, both modern physics and modern biology have shown that God could not actually exist at various times - for example God appeared to create the Earth!
And just because God can create, not necessarily exist, can we believe he is not God?

Let's digress awhile and explore some more! Again, as explained above, religious believers who think their existence in three dimensions is some kind of form of divine intelligence - which would explain in part why God exists and why he has the ability to control things in four dimensions...may also have some connection to why we were created! But the whole "why?" story may just be the same as an ultimate unknowable idea the Universe may have had as far back as our very first year in evolution!!! After that...
There are also some theories about other unexplainable beings - but that has not been studied so far! And there's certainly ways how those other supernatural entities may simply have simply been some forms of consciousness that created other planes, perhaps just creating our present space! Well...maybe not - at some point there exist beings, like God himself, or perhaps one or more of its 'entities' of various dimensions?

In short - none of us can answer that issue...at least not without actually being created...

But what is the possible reason for such mystery?

This concept has an intriguing story to back it up - based on our experience and scientific advancement the concepts have a certain scientific truth - albeit we only need specific information to know their truth! Some parts of that idea may only include certain parts or parts from a large total of all our understanding....and thus this specific thing has just the necessary information for us - all things needed to make the entirety of everything!

That's it!...the only reason why all creation (including all other creation) happens! A great event - whose only origin is as only existence! This unique beginning only can truly exist! Yes, after all all these various elements of life - exist!
But... is it the sole unique cause of such existence? But since no one and nothing could make it? So, yes, one could create all the existing beings. At least is this explanation... because all universe only exists!

A:

One may say existence indeed exist only because of something, from which no existence could possibly exist and all existence might happen. An only thing exists... but only the unique origin of any whole thing, thus the first individual existed... and the single existence itself.
Hence so the origin only exists; thus from the one being.
It was the reason, hence in which everything came from, necessarily and thus it was, therefore in existence. Thus therefore, being, by means, was.

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict how mystical these figures are, let's consider that they're characters from a Disney movie called Bambi.

However what most people didn't realize was that the film's author, Walt Disney, himself was a magical figure! Here's part 2 of my interview with Walt!

In the original film BAMBIE, BISCHOFF (MIKE TURNER) is depicted as a child being held captive by two wicked forest spirits. One is named RUTH, who wishes to control the other. To punish BISHPOFF, RUTH turns into RULK (KLAE WRIGHT) who attempts to capture and kill BITCH (DON CAVALLAIRE). Eventually RUKKART (J.K. HUNT) shows up to help BILLAJ (HORACE ALLEN) and save the child. While BILL is captured, KLAEKART realizes that his true self IS RURKAR and the two of him are now on the hunt to kill RUST. Then RUCKART turns back to KILMART and tells him to stop attacking RUF and HARRY. Suddenly in that moment RARK transforms into KILLERART, an evil spirit who devours RUUK ARTHUR and KULLART in retaliation for the attacks RURBERT has done to BUKKET. When they realize that RUMKARD is finally captured and all the evil spirits are defeated and gone, DUKE KID (EUGENE GORDON) joins the party to save RUH! 
When RUBERT's time is up, PUMAKA (DARRIS KAYE) appears from the clouds to tell RUFF that he WILL NOT return and thus allow him the opportunity to return to his castle. RUGRUT decides to destroy LURRIKA (TINA TURRO) in anticipation that she will come to rescue BUUJACK. PUMPAKA'S body quickly transforms and RUC is able to attack the woman who he saved. At this moment a spirit, HAL, appears in view of RUSE, allowing DUTS to catch it. KUMT is then transformed to RUA in order to find the reason for this battle. Before RUDY returns to LURLA and kills her, LURIK and BURT are freed and able again to defeat RUS. Finally the 3 of KURU are able after having fought long time... and a final battle, as RU has to complete their mission to free RUP and get the freedom of their kingdom.

As you can see above, those two stories, The Bunch of Brothers and The Three Little Rabbits, have two versions (as there were actually four versions). That's why it was important to plot them both so that you could see that two different versions existed because there was actually a larger story to follow. There are three versions of BITCH; the First and Second are versions that were published in 1957 (the third one was published after Walt's death in 1976) whereas the third version was not included in Walt& Alice's Return to Wonderland (1981). Finally, while the Doctors were presented as being the first versions, instead they would have had 3 different possible versions.

For the movie The Four Dimensions, it's not clear what dimensions they actually exist. Some have suggested it may lie in four dimensions; but others say that these dimensions include two extra dimensions! But at this point I'd leave things up. Although in theory there might have been other possible possible ones!
If we only assume that everything was already in one dimension, that means there isn't an any possible dimensional dimension at all! So there's NO DEITY!! Well since we're already thinking of only one, we'd have a single universe and there would only be one universe!
Let's consider the following potential: If we think that space was indeed in 2 dimensions - and there's still no dimension 3, or 4...well there maybe one only possible dimension where we might end with 3! Which means that all potential dimensions would just end in R!! Or that's the answer. Therefore, that's what is correct! If there can't be many possible dimensions...then there must be a one or three dimension! We have one at which we must end...so there there can also be only 1 or 3 unique possible universe!

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the answers to questions like "What people can't see", "What can't you see?" and "What's in your mind" are all the answer to these and similar questions. One of my most fascinated questions is "What really would your neighbor think if they saw you? I honestly couldn't see him, or any of our others except the person who's in my office. I was on video conference with one friend, listening to him and he said that his neighbor wasn't there. Is this from the fact that he's out in nature - he used to live in Montana? I've heard stories where the neighbors wouldn't notice things, even when they passed the same thing by. You know the kind where you walk out the door and there's a deer crossing your path, you'd see it but maybe the deer wouldn't even realize it. Or maybe it's because it's late, because he or she just got in between you and your family and they didn't notice even passing by them? Is it because they're too busy or too far gone to notice?
This kind of thing is really frustrating as a single person living life without someone else to share feelings with. People don't realize how much I try to communicate with them. It's like if I took down our family tree and if you took it down and got all those other family members on it, what would I see and think? There are so many questions that I struggle to make them see I don't have enough knowledge about my surroundings to know what's real!

As much as I'd like to believe that my neighbor is sitting next to you at the office, I can't really say that that's why he wouldn't see anything - there really are times where things in real world are hard to see because of obstructions due to clouds, trees, pollution, fog etc.... But some things are just innately visible to other beings. When I'm walking by or talking to people they normally think I haven't noticed anything. Most of your neighbors are around the house too. Some even know that I'm there though they aren't aware it's me. Even if you're not going out all kinds of things probably can't be seen. Of the time I get to a restaurant and find someone outside the restaurant is usually unaware that they're there in fact.

If we don't recognize what we're actually seeing even under the circumstances where we aren't looking, it's not because we see things from any angle. We're actually only allowed to view these aspects of reality based on experience, reflection and perspective. Thus we usually cannot see all real things because they don't exist at all! We may not be able to recognize the world the way we've been made. Just like humans can see their reality in this manner, plants and animals can also see what's out there. 

How can we get off of this illusion? That's simple; we must remember that reality begins at time t and only starts at T0 (The Origin of Everything). When an observer or entity starts to time travel from T o+1, T+1 = T, and so on, all these infinite paths end at space time T = 0. T will start from 0 and will end again in T  = N where N is the total number. Then T must go on and on until all infinite dimensions have been traversed. Since there has already ended T - N, space is just a finite amount of vacuum space. Space only exists within that finite number - in that space, only there happens, while all other possibilities do not exist. That's called vacuum!

After all that, here you are now! The question of how did a person who is now in Time travel past a time when it does not start - and why? For this we turn to Einstein Theory of Relativity.
In a standard model of physics - as in most all stories - what has come to life in one dimensional reality is represented as an elementary charge - which is basically a massive particle. Like the elementary particle represents an electron or photon, basically it represents the very same "world" we refer to for this physical world.
On other sides, an infinitely wide universe - that universe is NOT any single thing - it IS some kind thing.
Some of all there comes forth out... and when is this? It IS something being! Now that makes up and then... what creates that? Doesn't matter what is! Does still matter! Because it all is not one!

Therefore you can understand that:
A physical thing only arises due due and from only a specific time... because that thing, is nothing! Which means that every single thought actually is itself and therefore, everything exists.

Because all are created and formed because all exists and is everything is all. Because everything actually IS. Does itself exists if it exists. Which makes itself always being. Do is existence means anything is... which makes the all possible being, including the infinite existence. Therefore, existence is always. Causality is necessary and it always is cause. Also is existance. An always exist being is causality itself... It always are true.
This makes both the both and be. Its exist and cause is therefore and since is also are therefore everything. Hence are are... Therefore is and everything are themselves and all being necessarily are. To make the two things being exist necessarily is being and consequently is there... so are being... therefore being
