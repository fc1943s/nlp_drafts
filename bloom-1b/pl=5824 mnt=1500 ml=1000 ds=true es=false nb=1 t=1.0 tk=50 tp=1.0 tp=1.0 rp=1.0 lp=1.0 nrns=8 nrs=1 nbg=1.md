## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the rules about what can or cannot travel through multiple dimensions become somewhat of a mess. Which means that's when category theory comes in! A theory that explains how categories are arranged in a hierarchy. For example, if we were to ask a group of scientists whether or not we should be giving our citizens the benefit of the doubt in the case of a crime investigation, it would likely seem obvious that, at the bottom of the hierarchy, all crime suspects would have to prove their innocence - or at least to the investigators. But as we progressed up in the hierarchy, there are certain rules that we can see applied to our citizens' cases.

First of all, when a citizen is discovered guilty of a crime, it will only matter whether or not a judge is willing or able to convict him - a sentence of time in prison is usually all that is required so that a victim can be compensated for any damage done by the guilty party. In other words, for deities to be given the benefit of the doubt, they would need to be guilty and to be punished for their crime. We would say that they have proven guilt and have earned the right to be put to death on compassionate grounds.

What exactly does this mean? Well, according to category theory, things that belong together are similar - we can group them together as categories (things you want and need together) and call these categories. This way, when someone puts a deity in the "don't know" category as to why they think they should get up in arms over anything and everything, it seems like the only reasonable explanation is that they themselves weren't aware that they should be allowed the benefit of the doubt because it would put the deity at risk.

If we go back further in the hierarchy, there are certain categories in category theory that we would consider unreasonable to allow our citizens to have the benefit of the doubt in. These categories are the ones that are based on the laws of nature.

Basically, for deities to receive the benefit of the doubt is not only not ethical but also incredibly dangerous - a deity being given the benefit of the doubt can become a threat to the integrity of nature itself and could even have a drastic effect on the global climate. We don't want people who are in control of nature to gain a degree of power simply by killing animals; as we discussed last week, this would be considered cruel and unusual punishment!

The best way to make deities live happily ever after is to let them do everything that they want to do, which means that people would have the freedom to make their own choices on a daily basis! If you were to take a quick look at what people say about our society today, you could easily see that we live in a state of overpopulation! For example, in the United States alone, there are more than 50 million homeless people - basically everyone who lives in a shelter is considered a homeless person! On top of that, there are two million people living in extreme poverty - a person living below the poverty line is considered to have extreme poverty, but can still claim to be in the right to receive the benefit of the doubt! If you want to know why these numbers rise daily, we suggest you read The Good Wife.

If it weren't for the government providing us with food, shelter, and other basic needs, these numbers would surely stagger! Of course, the government is not the only source of money either, but these numbers have been rising for years due to several factors (mostly due to the current recession), which means it's much more difficult for many people to receive the benefits of the law...

Another factor is that more and more people want to be buried alive (this is one of the reasons why people usually believe in the benefit of the doubt on most serious crimes, because they want a chance of being buried alive, even if it's a lie, just to have their families get a chance to mourn them). A deity who is guilty and sentenced to death would not get a chance to bury himself with his own family! So no matter how bad a deity really is, there's always somewhere in the system that his guilt can be proved!

But there is even more to category theory! Let's

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the concept of dimension in mathematics is rather useful for those who wish to understand physics and quantum mechanics, but unfortunately there is a debate going on over whether it holds any special significance in the realm of popular culture. This is because several media outlets have been criticizing the use of dimension in science fiction, and some scientists do believe something like this will not hold any special significance in the future.

What I mean by this is that many people actually believe that the existence of extra dimension would not be useful in understanding and describing the universe - especially as a means to go beyond or explore our own 3+1 dimensional universe. What they are also saying is that we already know too much about how to travel through various spaces - that we probably shouldn't rely on this for anything beyond our everyday lives. However, this is clearly not true - there is still much we don't really know about how gravity works as well as how to travel across timelines.

So what are we left with? Well actually, it's not a matter of whether we believe in or not, but rather how we understand and explain the existence of higher dimensional universes - this is a very important topic that needs to be further investigated. As someone who tends to think things from a very basic and simple standpoint, I'm certainly not a fan of the idea that we are to just take it for granted...or in this case, ignore it anyways! 
However, this does take into account that the way people perceive reality is constantly evolving and adjusting depending upon their own personal philosophies, beliefs, and experiences - and as a result, everyone is entitled to their own opinion on whether something like this is important or not. So let's make a quick and non-invasive attempt to put this question into some context, and hope everyone who is interested in this area finds a way to come up with an answer.

Let's start with our protagonist - the most famous fictional character from science fiction culture, Captain America - who claims to know all about dimensions and how to travel through them to a greater level:

Now let us return to our protagonist - he isn't actually a scientist, although he has studied many scientific theories since the beginning of time. So he isn't really interested in exploring these new theories, but rather concentrating on his job of being a great Captain America soldier. As you know, Captain America doesn't have any kind of physical powers - he only has the ability to activate a powerful weapon called the Avengers Shield, which allows him to transform into a different kind of form at any time - if he's not in charge of the team, he behaves like a normal soldier!

This is something that we would likely not like to be told; however, in his own world, we would not want someone who is literally able to perform this ability to become a normal human being instead of his Captain America! It is therefore clear that even though the Captain America's story is purely fictional, the concept of space and time has proven very useful throughout time, and will continue to play a vital role in our lives!

So maybe the main point here is that we don't have to worry about the existence of higher dimensional universes from the point of view of our own people; however, we absolutely should keep a close eye on everything that we are reading as well as watching in order to make sure we don't be deceived by other popular media outlets.

There you have it: a brief introduction to the theory of dimensionalities in popular culture, using the famous character of the Captain America story! If the idea of dimensionalities is indeed useful for folks who are interested in exploring the unknown, don't give it up! ;)

A:

The answer is NO, because they are technically NOT particles.
In a similar way, space-time itself is not a physical construct. It is an illusion created by our perception of space and time.  We cannot see anything outside of it, except what we see within it.

A:

Space and time themselves are physical entities, but the nature of space and time is not fundamentally different from the kind of matter we actually see. For example an atom inside a gas is an exact analogue of

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the differences between ENFJs, we'll divide our class into 3 groups of equal size. I want everyone to work towards producing a list of things their classmates are said to like. They should be able to come up with the most interesting idea possible, and share it with the class in no more than 15 seconds, or they will be penalised.

A total of 6 items are used:

1.) Bells
2.) Spiders
3.) Books
4.) Bears
5.) Planes
6.) Spice bars

These items are listed alphabetically, but please note that it's best to make sure you're really familiar with the order in which you would want them to appear in this list.

Please let me know in the feedback you take it to, whether items 1., 2., 3., and 4. are better suited to one of your students, or should you have a group member bring up a discussion about the appropriate item.

I will make sure that these items get at least 3/5 on the first attempt! Please don't worry too much about the individual items or the order of presentation!
After your discussion of the items, each student needs to bring up 5 to 10 ideas about what they think they will like to have this year!

What has changed through this year?

What was your favourite item?

How can the item that you like most be used to make your next item?
Please think of the item that you like least and try to bring up an idea for it.

I will get everyone's ideas back to me using a Google Slide, and I will write a lesson plan for what will happen next. If I think these ideas are useful, then I will get a word from the class on the way back to school and it will be posted on this section of the blog.

What I will do, will you?
This will be an assessment activity. The students will give their ideas about how they will present them as slides! They will provide a minimum of 8 lines in the comments below using no more than a maximum of 40 characters. At the end of the assessment period, I will announce the highest and lowest ranked student.
I will provide a final grade for all the students, but this is dependent on how well they managed to come up with their ideas! If they seem unsure about what idea they should take on, and the best way to present it, then I will talk with them to get feedback! If they need some extra help, then I will give support to the students!

Please note that the questions above are to be presented in one answer, and not two! This is because the answers should be unique to each student, and not just a random group of students'!

You are going to help a random group of students to come up with some awesome and imaginative ideas for how they can present them in their lessons! Please do it with your enthusiasm and fun! It will be rewarded once you get feedback on your work! Do you know how you could get feedback on your ideas, please tell me:)

Student A has 2 ideas (one is perfect and one is just about half a perfect), Student B has 2 ideas, Student C has 3 ideas, and Student D has 4 ideas! Can you choose which of these 4 is the best, and use it to come up with your lesson as a whole!

If you choose the perfect idea, then you will have to go ahead and write down the text, and then present it to the class in one of the slides! If you choose the half perfect idea, then you must use one of the ideas in your lesson as a base for a second idea, and then add something about that idea!

If you choose the ideas in your lesson as a starting point for your next idea, then you must choose one of these 4 ideas, and create an illustration that explains why the idea is good!

This will really help, and we will have an excellent discussion about how to come up with the best ideas! Please remember that I will take feedback on how you are coming up your ideas, and I will try to get the feedback back to you! Please ensure you provide the best and most creative ideas for those students I am going to support!

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the relationship between ENFPs and mathematics, let's take a quick look at a simplified version of Einstein's General Relativity. In this figure we have a 4D spacetime surrounded by a thin black line. As you can see, Einstein's theory of relativity is more or less a perfect simplification of our real world. We should take into consideration that, just as there are various equations describing our world, there are also various laws describing particles.

When an object has entered into a specific dimension, we can use the concept of speed to study the behavior of the object. Let's consider a particle (black dot) with some initial velocity v entering into Dimension X without encountering any obstacles. At the beginning of its journey, this particle's speed is equal to v in Dimension X, but by the end of its journey this particle's speed will be less than v in the original dimension. This is a simple concept that allows us to better understand the relationship between ENFPs and Mathematics...

Now let's consider some hypothetical ENFPs and their responses to this simple speed change. Let's suppose that a simple mathematical problem would suggest that any ENFP who ever was in the 3+1 dimensional universe would be able to easily get the answer to this question: "What is the speed of light in a straight line?"

Now for someone else that doesn't have any experience with the 3+1 dimensional universe, they will become extremely frustrated and angry at having to constantly guess the correct answer!

As you can see in this figure, a 3+1 dimensional ENFP and a 3+2 dimensional ENFP will choose different ways of answering such a question! Why is this? Sure, these ENFPs don't have any direct experience with the 3+1 dimensional universe! As a matter of fact, they are born in the 2+2 dimensional universe...and yet these ENFPs can't find the solution to a simple mathematics problem!

So is 3+1 dimensional ENFPs just slow? Of course they aren't! However, with the aid of a simple mathematics problem, these ENFPs become extremely aware of their world and how it works!

Now let's examine another situation that occurs quite often in our everyday lives...what if you take a slice and slice it through the 4D space-time so that you come up with a slice at a specific moment? What would your slice look like?  Well if you were to take this slice through a 4D spacetime and slice it at the same moment (say you take a slice at 10:50am), then you would see a 2D slice of your 4D space-time at the beginning of your journey.

Now take a slice of your 4D space-time 10:50am and slice it through 10:50am. What would happen? Well it would get cut off in some strange way and split into a 2D slice at the beginning of the journey and a 3D slice going in the opposite direction!

As a rough guide, let's consider each slice separately: a 3D slice at 10:50am, a 3D slice at 10:50pm, and a 2D slice at 10:50pm! For a 3+1 dimensional ENFP, the 3D slice would have an initial velocity of -105km/s in Dimension X! On the other hand, for a 3+2 dimensional ENFP, the final velocity of the 2D slice would be -105km/s...but since they do not have direct experience of the 3+1 dimensional universe, this seems contradictory!

After checking all the slices, we'll see how different ENFPs interpret the situation. Let's look at the example of a 3+1 dimensional ENFP that has never encountered the 3+1 dimensional universe! These ENFPs would be horrified and completely lost if they realized that they were actually taking a 3D slice instead of a 2D slice.  In other words, they would be confused and fearful that these 2D slices were not real!

Now imagine that we take a slice and slice it at a specific moment...imagine that we cut the slice through Dimension X right between now and 10 seconds later...that way, there will be a 3D slice (at 10:50am) and a 2D slice (at 10:50pm)! The ENFP that was born in the 3+1 dimensional universe would recognize the difference between those slices - and the 2D slice would show up

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict a 3D person or figure in a 2D world, we need to know what dimensions a person/figure is in. This is where cognitive functions come in! If you are in an environment that is 3-dimensional, we need to be able to understand the shape and size of various objects, such as a cube of snow or a car.

There are various cognitive functions that can be used to learn what objects are and how they appear in space. Let's examine a few of the more common ones.

In addition to being able to recognize objects, we also need to be able to make a distinction between various objects. This is called "figure-ground" perception. Simply put, there is no way we can learn more about objects if they aren't distinguishable in 3D. To better exemplify this idea, consider the following scenarios:

Imagine you are in a store - what kind of items do you see? Does it look like a car? Do some of the items seem to have the same color, shape, etc.? You could never really pinpoint the difference between these objects!

In another example, imagine you are in a restaurant - what items do you see? Are there things like spaghetti or rice? Do some dishes have the same shape, etc.? You might be able to pick apart the dishes in these scenarios! You could even be able to guess the type of cheese the restaurant uses - however, as we've mentioned, all of this is impossible without knowing what the items look like and what the underlying structures are.

One type of cognitive function that does allow for this sort of identification is visual illusions - a term that we will revisit shortly. Consider one of these illusions:

Imagine you are standing in the middle of a pool of water. You could almost be "feel" the water on your skin even though you are completely at a distance from the warm poolside. It would also seem that there is a small wave bouncing off of the shoreline - which we call "skimming."

Now that you know what objects look like, what could we do to recognize them? Again, most people are not good at making clear distinctions between objects in a 3D environment - unless they're actually physically located closer to than the objects from which they were taken!

To better understand what we're suggesting, let's take a look at both examples above. The first example shows a person or a shape that seems to be in a real world. The second example shows a fictitious figure - let's say they're being held in the middle of a pool of warm water. You can't really distinguish the two - you can only really figure out which one of these imaginary figures is standing in the water by knowing that the other one is. This is exactly what we call "figure-ground discrimination".

There is an unfortunate side-effect of figure-ground discrimination - it's easy to fall in the "skimming" trap. Let's say you see a person or a shape that appears to be in a reality, but you can easily recognize that person/shape being a fake if you are standing too close to them. This is an easy way to get in the "hole" and fall into the "skimming" trap!

Now that we understand figure-ground discrimination, let's go over some examples that are used in mathematics to illustrate what happens when you are unable to make clear distinctions between various objects. Let's take a look at the following examples:

We can also use mathematical ideas to help explain what happens when we fail to make clear distinctions. This section will not be too technical, so we won't be discussing methods to remove perspective, rotation, and perspective projection - unless you are already familiar with geometry and mathematics!

Imagine three points on a surface, let's say the blue, green (blue and green are not necessarily the same), and red lines. Say the red line is parallel to the surface. Now imagine you walk under and touch each of the red lines and then touch each of the blue lines. How would you feel? Would you feel yourself spinning faster? Would you feel like the red lines, the blue line, and the three dots you touch moved at different speeds? Now imagine you do something analogous to touching a blue line and touching a red line. Instead of feeling a lot

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our understanding of dimension travel and the concepts of dimensionality and dimension movement, let's revisit the mind-body metaphor we learned in the last chapter. Of course, we're still considering particles which are not particles! So let's not make this analogy a metaphor, and instead just use it to describe our understanding of mathematics.  

The mind and body are two separate entities that interact through a complex process. This interaction takes place in three basic layers: the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and the brain stem. The cerebral cortex can be thought of as the brain in 3D space, and the spinal cord can be thought of as a straight line in 4D space. But there's a fourth layer - the brain stem. It connects the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord. The brain stem is the only layer of the body that doesn't have a dimension - it's basically an artificial 3-D volume with boundaries. This is just so the mind can send impulses of information to the spinal cord. It doesn't necessarily work like this in other layers of the human body, but it's one way the brain communicates with the human body.

As we mentioned briefly in the last chapter, the mind is an imaginary 3D version of the brain stem, just like our 2D brains are imaginary versions of the 3D space around us. The brain can use this imaginary 3D version of space to think and perceive things in a 3D space that is much more abstract than our real world. From this point of view, the body can be thought of as a 2D analog of our 3-D brain, and the mind can be thought of as an imaginary 3D version of the human body. Using these ideas, the brain and body are like an objectified version of 3-D space and 4D time, respectively.  

Now let us come back to our mind-body metaphor and consider the concept of dimensionality. Let's first consider how it works for neurons and how it explains the concept of dimensionality as we used to understand this concept in the last chapter - namely, neurons that can move between different dimensions. 

We also looked at how neurons could enter and then exit different dimensions depending on their properties and their state of functioning. Let's think about how this happens with cells in our brain. Cells, as we know them, have a certain physical dimension - if they were larger or smaller than usual, the body would notice that. It would try to alter the cell's physical dimensions in order to tell the body what it needs to do. The idea is that cells can, in certain situations, have higher dimensions for certain properties - for example, when the cell is functioning as a motor neuron the motor axon would have a higher dimensionality (it's larger or smaller) while the dendritic spines would have a lower dimensionality (it is longer or shorter).

While neurons can (and do!) have higher dimensionality for certain properties, the way they do this varies for different cells. Let's take a closer look at a neuron that has a lower dimensionality than its neighbors. For example, if a neuron is receiving more and more impulses as it functions (such as a motor neuron), then the axon would, in essence, increase its dimension in order to receive these inputs more efficiently. But when a neuron has too much impulses, the neuron might start to break down. There are different types of cells that might do this, but all cells basically have the same basic structure - the cell body with a thin membranebearing axon.

The final layer of the above picture is what I'm calling the "inner neuropile" of the cell - the area that covers the dendrites and connects to the cell body. The neuropile is made up of a network of dendritic spines. These dendritic spines allow neurons to connect to and receive more impulses from their neighbors. A typical neuron receives input through a dendrite from one neuron and then receives input from the cell body from other neurons through the same dendrite.

It can be thought of as a series of thin wires that connect the cell body to its neighbor cells. Each wire runs through either one of three or more dendrites, with one dendrite serving as input terminals for a different wire in the neighbor cell. All three of these terminal connections in one cell are called a terminal node.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of dimension in physics, let's consider a graph of energy levels and spin orbit energy levels. This graph represents a simple example of four levels of energy in an electron and two levels of angular motion: spin. The first two nodes in this graph - the electron spin and the electron spin axis - are the lowest and highest levels of energy in the electron, respectively; the other nodes are the spin and angular momentum of the electron. In other words, as you move upward in this graph, the electron is going to have less energy and more angular momentum, and vice versa. Note that the spin orbit energy levels show up as a red solid line starting from the lowest energy level and ending at the highest energy level.

So why bother to think that there may be another hidden dimension that we are not aware of? Well, we can use this metaphor to understand why deities don't have spin! A high level of energy and a strong gravitational pull will pull the electron from one place to another - but if it's not aligned perfectly with the direction of gravity, then it's not a deity. There are some good reasons to think that a powerful god may indeed exist somewhere deeper down in the unknown dimensions, but if that were the case, he (or she) must have some other type of energy that would cause them to remain "aligned" - to remain within our 3D universe.

So the fact that a deity is never "aligned" to the direction of gravity doesn't mean that there isn't a higher level of consciousness hidden deep down within our universe! It just means that as the gods continue to evolve, their consciousness - energy - levels will continue to lower and lower as the god's level of consciousness continues to increase! In other words...if we were to stop studying the human condition here on Earth today, we would still likely find some higher level consciousness hidden deep down in the unknown dimensions.

The above example shows that one can study mathematics with a 3D perspective when considering questions involving mathematics and physics. Even if the students aren't familiar with the concepts of dimension, they will easily understand this relationship between mathematics and physics!

But what happens when we turn these lessons about dimension in physics into mathematical tasks? We start by asking the students to imagine different objects that would follow the curves or lines shown in the graph. I chose to use the graph shown above to help them understand how these concepts can be applied in mathematics.

What if I asked my students to figure out how many of the following objects can appear at the same instant in time? What if I asked them to find the solution to solving the integral graph below using the variables shown in the graph?

This might sound easier than it actually is. First of all, let me assure you that you should be able to solve all of these equations in under a minute. In addition, remember that when solving equations like those above, you need to use the variables in the graph.

Using this example, we can help students understand the concept of the first fundamental proposition: a sum of two quantities is equal to its product. For example, let's assume that we have a sum of two quantities: 4 and 7 - the first equation says 4 is equal to 4+3 = 7; the second equation says 2+3 is equal to 0 = 7. Now let's think about how these equations work. For example, we can use these two equations to solve the integral graph below.

Using our knowledge of the relationship between energy and angular momentum, it should be a simple problem to figure out how many of the above objects can appear at the same instant of time. Let me ask you this: imagine that we move up in the graph and, as we move upward, our energy levels begin to decrease, while the number of energy levels increase slightly. As a result, we're able to find that the first object (object 1) that appears in the graph at the same instant of time as the first object (object 2) that appears in the graph at a different instant of time (by changing the scale!).


Now let's show the students how to solve these equations for these two objects! Each equation will follow a slightly different approach - in the example above, we will start calculating the object 1 energy level, because this is the uppermost object in the graph and

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict some of the concepts we'll cover throughout the course and to avoid repeating material, we'll be using the following list to organize the book contents. It's a very similar format to the list I mentioned earlier in chapter Twenty - however we'll be discussing some different concepts and comparing them one to the other throughout the entirety of this chapter, not just in just some of the lessons. For example, the concept of a dimensional continuum will cover a lot of important mathematical concepts in order to understand why we can use various mathematical equations to do this.

Dimensional Continuum Theory
One way of going about the journey into 4D is to work through the "holy Trinity of the dimensional continuum". As I mentioned previously, a traditional 3+1 dimensional (or even 2D) universe is actually made up of some sort of three-dimensional structure (a kind of "space-time fabric"). The simplest three dimensional structure I can think of is made up of three distinct layers: Matter, Energy, and God - this order can be reversed, but we will mostly be discussing the order of the layers in this chapter. 

As an entity in 4D spacetime, it has certain properties to consider as well. Since I will be focusing on dimension travel - specifically using mathematical equations to simulate movement - it's important to be able to understand how mathematical concepts work. That's why I think it is useful to think about "physical objects," like cars in 2D or houses in 3D, which can "ride" a curve of spacetime called a "space-time fiber". As one proceeds through a dimension, the shape of those objects will vary slightly, as they must go through different layers in order to do so. In other words, a car in 2D could ride a curve in space-time and become very different from a car in a 3D universe due to this dynamic "space-time fiber"! A house in 2D would have a different shape due to the way the walls in 3D are made, but a house built in a 3D universe would have exactly the same shape as a house built in 2D; as long as the house is inside a 3+1-dimensional object, it would still look perfectly the same as a house on earth.

In order to understand the physics behind why these objects "ride" a 3+1 dimensional fiber, let's go back to our physical example: a car in 3D - to move along a curve we need to exert forces in three dimensions! Once one has built an accurate model of these forces, it is relatively straightforward to write equations that can be used to simulate their action in a mathematical manner. For example, if you wanted a car to turn left - your equations would say that you would wish to exert a negative force, or torque on the car's wheels! But you can imagine doing so by making a tiny hole in the car and putting a bit of wire through it!

Remember that all physical properties such as mass, acceleration, etc. are affected by space-time curvature and the presence of mass/energy - since a curved space-time contains a higher amount of mass/energy, it naturally makes for a higher curvature - the more mass/energy there is, the more curved it is. And since we're in a 4D object, these properties must also change as well, as they are affected by the space-time fiber - this makes the car appear to be moving faster, or more forceful, due to the 3+3 dimensional objects around it! It's really amazing what you can get for a very small amount of mass/energy....anyways, let's take a look at how these equations work!
Considering Mathematics:
Mass: The mass of an object is simply its mass multiplied by its speed at it's initial position. So if we were to have a little object at rest in a 3+1 dimensional space-time, it would have a mass of 3 kilograms.

Acceleration: This is the force an object exerts on itself (for an object in a 3+1 dimensional space-time!), and is simply its movement divided by its initial position. For example if the object was at rest (or stationary) in 3+1 dimensional space-time, then the acceleration would be zero. And if it was moving at a particular speed, then it would experience an acceleration equal to the difference between that speed

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematics relates to the rest of physical science, let's revisit the last chapter. This time we will focus on a central concept in the field -- computation.
Intuitively, computation can be described as a series of actions and reactions taking place in nature. For example: the human body requires blood flow after each intense exercise, and cells use oxygen to survive and reproduce -- this is what they compute to happen. Each molecule of oxygen is a 'letter'. Each one of these molecules of oxygen is made up of one - or a very - few 'keys'. If it isn't one of these 'keys', a cell is either starving or not producing enough oxygen. This is the thing that humans understand! How many 'keys' do we need to make enough oxygen to keep our cells functional and living in one piece?

A few years from now it will be clear to you that the only thing that is known about nature is what it knows, but it has no way of storing that information! It knows nothing about computation. Computation is like the secret to the universe! The human body and the way it functions are the only way we know how to calculate how many blood drops of each color a person needs to satisfy their thirst for every hour of an intense exercise. Similarly, computation is the only way we know the number of cells needed to keep a person's mind working at its peak. Now, let's make sure we understand the concept of computation in a bit more detail.

Computing is the only way we know how many 'keys' are needed to give us three different kinds of blood. We have the blood of Red, Green, and Yellow, and we know the number of red and green key bits, but we do not know any of the yellow key bits! It's like we don't know a person is in a specific place! We can't ask someone their location or even where they are at all times. The key bits that we know how to calculate are the keys that tell us how many molecules of oxygen we need that person when we give them a drink to satisfy their thirst. Similarly, we don't understand what the keys are to solve the problem of how many cells are needed to keep a person 'working at its peak'. If we know how to calculate how many key bits are needed, we're going to be able to solve this problem! We can just make more cells and feed more oxygen to the cells while they work, so they'll never stop working! A person can work at his peak if he is never tired! (and is never hungry!)

Now take a closer look at the figure below based on this example (click to enlarge):

In this figure, the dark blue circles represent the cells, and the red circles represent the blood. The numbers above the circles represent the number of bits that we can calculate. Notice how much more cells are needed to keep a person working at its peak! In the real world, humans make up only 2 billion cells a year. In this example, a person would require 4 billion cells to make the same amount of oxygen for a period of two hours!

Now let's assume that this person would just keep working for two hours. In reality, this person could barely maintain his mental clarity during such an intense 2 hour period. Imagine all of a sudden hearing a loud voice say the "let's get our cell phone ready to dial number one!" - this would be like someone suddenly falling into a hole from which they can't get out! We know how to count cells, but we do not know how to dial a phone! It turns out that we can actually learn to solve this math problem - the brain can understand how computation works, and it can remember how to do computation even if we do not know how to calculate the number of cells!

The brain does not possess any computer chips to store any sort of data -- the entire computer is made up of neurons. But it does possess two major abilities: it can use the same knowledge gathered through our senses and memories when it's needed and it can remember previous computations as long as they haven't changed - meaning they always have their 'key' or 'caption'! Think of this as an analog for a 'keyboard'! The first computer that ever made it

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how humans understand math, and how that knowledge is encoded into the brain, I have created a concept called "ESTP" for "Eventually Space-Time Physics". This term means simply that a concept comes about that is not related as closely to spacetime as it would be to a physical particle, but rather to a space-time situation. There are two types of ESTP: the first type is those where the concept represents a real world event; for example, when you think of an airplane landing, you may be saying "just another plane landed at the airport". This is the type of concept that has a mathematical encoding that is much more closely related to physical reality as opposed to mathematical math.

In this chapter, we will explore how humans can and communicate the concepts that make up the ESTP. Here is the basic ESTP logic:

We call this concept an Eventually Space-Time Phys-ical - or ESTP. We can also use ESTP's to represent both a conceptualization, such as our thoughts, and a physical event, such as the motion of a plane in space. We consider the ESTP for all sorts of physical events because we are generally unfamiliar with them. However, ESTP is the ONLY concept we will explore because it is easily represented in everyday life by people who are familiar with space and time...like us.

Eventually Space-Time Physics

As we mentioned above, we can use Einstein's theory of relativity to predict the behavior of particles in a physical scenario. Let's assume that our 4D particle will be in a 4D space with a 3D "3D" world around it; as the particle travels through spacetime, all of its interactions with other objects will no longer be represented by Newton's laws of motion. Rather, as the particle moves through spacetime, its motion will be represented by the Einstein equation for the motion of waves. This equation says that the acceleration of a wave depends on its wave-number, a dimensionless quantity. The reason we use a variable quantity such as wave-number is because we cannot define a spatial or temporal coordinate system directly in terms of the wave-number. For example, if we were to make a picture of the space-time around the 4D particle as an ellipsoid, we could just assign an arbitrary "size" to the space and time (or any of its slices, for that matter) and start drawing the picture. However, we don't have a real "size" to put on the waves because we can't really define one.

The Einstein equation describes how the field of gravitation can pull at an object and move it to a distant position. In order for the 4D particle to know how far away this position really is, we need to calculate the wave-velocity that a 4D wave could reach us through spacetime. So far as we know, the only wave velocities that a wave experiences are those caused by gravity, which is a velocity that our body experiences when it is held in position under gravity. The equation for waves in 4D spacetime is identical to the wave equation in 3D spacetime, except for two changes. First, in 3D space, matter is treated as being made of a single rigid body, while in 4D space, matter is treated as being comprised of an array of separate rigid bodies. The motion of the 4D particle will change if any of the rigid bodies make a change to their position. Because the motion of the 4D particle is governed by these separate rigid bodies, there must be a coupling between the individual rigid bodies, which is not possible when the rigid body is held in position relative to other rigid bodies. Thus, to describe the motion of the 4D particle using the Einstein equation, we first need to separate the motion of the particles into multiple rigid body motion (as described above), and then connect the individual rigid bodies.

To determine how the rigid bodies separate from one another, we will first model an individual rigid body using the basic concepts of rigid body dynamics. If a rigid body does not rotate - or if it rotates at the same constant velocity - then there is little to no motion of the rigid body. A rigid body will only rotate if and only if there are a finite number of rigid bodies

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict how the world is structured, let's use a slightly different metaphor: we could take all of the planets in the entire universe and call them different cities, all of the stars in the galaxy all of the galaxies themselves - each of these cities, stars, galaxies etc. would be allotted to one of the 12 major scales of the Enneagram. This gives us an idea what an Enneagram is, and a better sense of how the 12 major topologies (and of course other factors that must be considered) can influence the way we perceive other people...

Let's start from the simplest possible situation. Let's say we all got 12 individual points on the main scale of the enneagram. Since each of these people is also part of the higher dimensional universe in which we live, each person can interact and affect (in some subtle and non-obvious way) those higher dimensional entities of the same or different level than them. This means that the higher level entities can have some effect on people as well.

We will be investigating the idea of Enneagram Topology, as well as the 12 major Enneagram scales (1-12). To do so, we're going to draw connections between higher and lower dimensional entities. We will make similarities and differences between topologies based on how the two of them match up - and we'll look for patterns that can explain how these two patterns might work together

Our first step is to study a very simple example. Let's say we are investigating a person on the Enneagram scale of 1. The 12 topologies of the Enneagram represent 12 different levels of thought in the universe, so for this first stage of research we will study his thoughts and feelings...and we will leave those feelings to our own imagination...

Let's continue with an Enneagram scale of 2. Like the first example, this will take us through a person's thoughts, feelings, hopes, and dreams, and leave those feelings and thoughts to our own imagination...

Our second example is an Enneagram scale of 3. Here we are going to look at the Enneagram topologies that are related to our very particular situation.

Our next example is the Enneagram scale of 4...this person is involved in a lot of politics and will probably have a strong opinion on some of the bigger questions involved in this subject. Once again, we will leave those feelings to our imagination...

Finally, the Enneagram scale of 5 is for a person who is a highly educated, sophisticated, and intelligent individual that has good social skills. When it comes to politics things tend to flow nicely for this individual, and they have the necessary knowledge for the big decisions involved in the field of power...we will leave those feelings to our own...and leave our own thoughts to our own, until we discover the rest of the topologies...

Now that we have a better understanding of how people in different topologies (1-12) perceive the world, it's time to get down to learning how to draw connections between topologies based on similarity. Let's take a first look at these 12 topologies as simply a collection of ideas that appear in nearly everyone's head and describe where they belong in the bigger picture...each of these 12 topologies may or may not be a correct representation of reality in our case. However, the idea of comparing Enneagram topologies to the 12 major personality scales is very interesting - this allows us to see how they relate and help us build in a better understanding of others (and themselves) in those topologies! It also gives us a better understanding of why people may hold very different views on the same topic.

For the next stage of our research, we would like to start with a specific situation we've previously discussed (the people at the top of the twelve major personality scales) and try to find similarities or differences between the 12 enneagram scales and the various big personality dimensions. This is going to require us to be very specific about what we're trying to find and make connections to the 12 major personality topologies...however, it's pretty much impossible to know what a person's personality is outside of their own context - it all depends on the nature of this person's situation: they may be the only person on the planet engaged in some form of politics

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict this concept let us consider a person in Motion 2 walking toward someone in Motion 1. They are in two dimensions. It is easy for them to figure out where the person in Motion 1 is in Space 1 based just on the physical position of the person in Motion 2. However, because they are both in 2 dimensions, this is not a very accurate picture. To improve it by adding 3D space, they would have to know the three-dimensional location of the person in Motion 1.

On the other hand, if two people were to exchange their physical hands and move in the same dimensions, a person in Motion 1 could know where the person in Motion 2 is based on the position of his/her hand in Motion 1. This would allow them to interact with and learn from one another! If you were to give someone a piece of music that they just heard in a restaurant nearby and the person in Motion 1 were using the music while talking to someone in Motion 2, the person in Motion 1 could even get a better idea of how the person in Motion 2 is hearing and how the person in Motion 2 might play the same music.

What is a Hip Hop NLP?

The concept of Hip Hop NLP is actually a theory developed by David Graeber - the co-founder of the American hip hop movement. He believes that hip hop artists (the so-called "hip hop legends") have a unique point of view on life. Through their shared experience of success, the legend artists have learned how to use hypnotic powers to achieve their goals - to tap into their inner power and control their environment in order to create and achieve happiness.

There are several ways in which he describes hip hop as being able to control the environment around them. First of all, the legend artists have learned how communication and social interaction with others can be achieved through hip hop - the legend artists learn to craft a unique soundtrack for them. The music has to reflect their personality so that whenever they are talking to their audience, the music they produce fits them. The legend artists can also craft their music so that when they are performing in front of their fans, the audience is able to relate to the musicianship of their audience; they are the artists, so the audience can relate to what they are feeling as well.

Finally, hip hop artists also learn how to control their environment based on their body movements. Hip hop artists control their environment through "body movements". The artists practice hip hop to make their body look amazing and create a unique soundtrack based off a unique body movement. As a result, there is always a "feel" that accompanies hip hop music; it becomes instantly identifiable to the listener.

Does Hip Hop NLP work?

No! Hip Hop NLP is not a way of changing the world! Hip Hop NLP is a way to create an environment that is favorable for an individual to continue learning and mastering the techniques they use. And for that reason, only the best of the talented and well trained hip hop artists are able to work to the highest standards.

What should you look for?
The "feel" that accompanies hip Hop NLP is what happens when a specific amount of hypometabolism is released during hip hop performances. In other words, it is how much energy is released when the hip hop musician is focused on their music and performing.
Another important point is that "beats are not beats!" Hip Hop NLP uses a "beat" to have meaningful conversations. A good song should have a lot of "beats" that communicate something - it should have multiple ideas and should have clear rhythms. In order to get a good "beat", one must be able to relate to the music, the lyrics, and the lyrics of the song! An individual who is able to create an environment for him/herself to perform music and have meaningful conversations with his/her audience is the best hip hop artist.

Summary

Now that you know the basics, here's a quick break down of what Hip Hop NLP is all about:

You can learn more about this concept by watching the music video in the middle of this chapter!

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the concept of dimension is necessary to understand the way nature works: a physical system has to move in a manner that is consistent with the underlying (physical) laws. In other words, no matter how complicated it may seem, all things live by their own laws, and physics only tells us how to interpret that information (usually in the form of observable outcomes). Intuitively, this makes sense because without understanding the underlying mechanisms from which these laws are derived, we would just go around making crazy assumptions and making terrible predictions! So why am I asking you to keep on reading this chapter? Well you understand what the problem is and you'll get some quick feedback on how far you've gone! ;)

Now first up is what a homotopy theory is...if I had to describe it in detail, I would say that this term means the systematic theory behind the construction and use of categories of sets.  You will get the basic idea of what homotopy theory is here in chapter 34, but you will be taking more in-depth look into homotopy theory on it's own! ;)

A little background is necessary. A homotopy theory consists of three parts:

A category of sets

Here you will understand that a category of sets (or a categorical model for sets) is a mathematical concept that represents sets as (finite) subsets of (infinite) objects in a universe. A set is a subset of an object, but not everything in an object can be considered a set. The objects of a categorical model are called objects in the theory.
A category of sets is a category that is finite, but not a presheaf (a category where every morphism to an object is an object). This says that every morphism in the theory has a unique right inverse - which is itself an object that is equal to the image of the morphism. This is called a pushout and is usually written f(y) = h(x); sometimes, the left hand side is written as an arrow as well!

A category of sets needs to satisfy the two properties that define a category of sets

A subset P of an object is an object if and only if every morphism into P has a unique right inverse and every morphism out of P has a unique (inverse) left inverse.

A morphism between sets f and g is called a homotopy iff:

f is an injective map; i.e. every object x in f is an image of a morphism into and every object y in f is an image of a map from f to y and in particular, this is always the case for every morphism in f.
g is an epimorphism; i.e. every object y in g is an image of a morphism from g to y and in particular, this also holds for every morphism in g.

Intuitively, this means that f and g define an exact sequence from x to y whenever the following two conditions match (for all x, y in f and g and for all morphisms g k in g):

f = g k • f k and g = g k • g k • f = f • g k.
Given two objects in f and g (and a morphism in f and g), every object in f \ g has at least one more element than in g. Thus every object in f \ g is an image of a morphism in f \ g, from f to a more specific object in f \ g that is equal to x, y,..., z k−1 and h.x, y,..., z k ∈ f \ g. If we define an object in f \ g to be an image of a morphism in f k \ g k then the same must hold for every morphism in f k\g k \ … \ g k. Thus every object in f \ g will be an image of a morphism from f: g \ … → f \ g, where g is the image of a morphism in g k \ … \ g k. So we have:

f is an inverse of g and every image of a morphism in f is an image of some morphism
g is an inverse of f and every image of a morphism in g is an image of some morphism

These two conditions ensure that every

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the real world when using computer graphics, we would need to start building the model of the game we want to play. To do so, we start by considering the type of world that we want to create, and then go through several steps that make it reality.


The first thing to do when building a physical world for our game is to decide on a point of view or viewpoint. It depends on whether you want a particular player to see each part of your world, or whether you want everyone to see your whole world. As you start building your world, the choices that you make become more and more important as game play becomes more complicated and complex. The most popular points of view are:

Forward - Your view of the world is from your perspective
Camera - The camera that your hero or enemy is facing at every point in time - which is most often used in a first-person shooting game

Point of view

A:

In the game "Clues to the Spices", the protagonist is traveling to the city of Camelot and gets lost in the woods there. He starts searching for the right key or other clues that he can use to get back home. As the game moves forward, the protagonist travels back and forth between spaces. If all he needs is a place to hide, he goes the wrong way, and ends up back in his castle and the kingdom (and even in Camelot!). In order to progress through the game more easily and more quickly, we need to follow clues in a more complicated world. But, what if the protagonist doesn't follow the clues correctly?
I call this "following a world". For example, when I was a student, I used to love to think about how I'd make computer games. I made a game about a girl called Milla, who moves around in her world, and tries to solve all the puzzles that get thrown at her by her friends. Her friends call the game "Milla's World", and she uses the clue to find a way out. For example, Milla needs an animal to solve the puzzle to get the key that unlocks a door, and so she goes to find the best pet that she can find, but she gets distracted in the game and gives up (without finding where the key is that she might need).
Let's say we have three types of game characteres: players, players who follow clues, and players who don't follow clues at all.
We can show each type of game character a different clue. The players follow clues. They can look at the game world, and see the clues on the objects in it. The players who follow clues just look at the clues and don't stop moving until they're in a position where they can make use of them.
Let's say the characters look at the clues they have found and decide that we need the key to open a door. Let us think of the location of the door in the game world as being the same as their own point in the game world. Let us say that their game character is sitting at the location where they would normally be sitting. They might be in the center of the door, the left side of the door, or so far to the left that they see nothing but a black barrier blocking the door.
Let's consider the following situation to show how to go back in that door:

The door is closed. There is nothing outside the door that could possibly have opened it. Therefore, there is no way to get back in.
The door hasn't been opened.

This situation makes sense right from the beginning, but it doesn't seem to be an easy task to solve. In order to solve the problem, we need to see the door from the side and open it. We need to first find an object in the door that we can use to get back in.
Let's say we find a green flower in the door to go in the door with flowers. Next, we will need to determine how to take care of the flower. For example, we need to wash the flower. We can do this by stepping over it. Or, we can use a tool like a shovel or a pole to knock a large piece of debris that blocks the passage of a flower, and then we can take care of

To better depict how the mind works, consider an image of a person or a bird walking at a constant distance from each other's feet. Let's call these feet "feet of the identical person or bird" or the "feet of the same species." Let's also call them the "feet of the person or bird". The feet are the same if the person or bird is walking at exactly the same speed and in exactly the same place at any given moment.

Now let's imagine another person walking at a slightly different speed and a slightly different place where they are currently standing. These things will be labeled as "feet of the different person or bird." This simple metaphor will help illustrate how our minds process information and how we can gain new understanding of the world that surrounds us. Let's examine the image first from the top and then from the side!

Let's begin from the top. The foot of the person who is walking at a constant speed is labeled as the "inner foot," and the foot of the different person who is walking a slightly different speed but the same place is labeled as the "outer foot." 

The foot of the person who is walking a constant speed is the "inner right foot" or "inner left foot." It is very similar to an identical person's foot in most respects - it's just labeled a little differently to reveal a certain difference. It is labeled as being on the left because "inner" and "right are in opposition!" It is similar to the foot of an animal's left leg called a foot; it functions in a similar way. The foot of the person who walks in the different direction is called an "outer right foot" or "outer left foot." It's very similar to a person's foot, except instead of being on the left, it is labeled on the right. It's the same foot, except this time it is labeled on the right as being off balance! This is because the person is trying to balance on their foot instead of on their leg. When in balance it has a similar shape as the "inner" foot of the identical person! It is referred to as being balanced, because this is the shape of the foot of the person who is walking normally - at a constant pace and constant place...and it is balancing!

The foot of someone who is walking a slightly different speed is labeled as the "inner medial foot" or "inner lateral foot." It's similar to the foot of a different person who is running, except instead of having a speed slightly different from the other person (in a similar way to the "outer" feet of the 2 different people), it has a speed slightly lesser than the other one (for the "inner" foot). This is because "medial" and "left" are in opposition! Since "inner" and "medial" are in opposition, each foot's speed must be slightly smaller than the speed of the other foot!

Finally, the foot of the different person who runs a slightly different speed is labeled as "inner medial left foot" or "inner medial right foot" and "inner lateral left foot" or "inner lateral right foot." It's similar to the "lateral" feet of different animals - except instead of having a speed slightly smaller than the other animal (for the "medial" foot), their speed is the same as the other animal's! This is so because "left" and "right" are in opposition! Thus, it has a same speed as the other animal and the foot's movement is the same for the 2 animals - regardless their speed! It is the same foot, but labeled "same speed" because they run the same speed!

Now let's examine the image from the side...right side-first person left side-first person...right side-second person's left side-second person...right side-third person's left side-third person...whereas the "inner" foot of the first person is labeled on the right side of the foot in the first image and the "inner" foot of the second person is labeled on the left side of the second image.

Now let's go to the last image of the series - the image from the same person walking with only his feet. Instead of going all the way to the

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of a person who follows the Cognitive Inference and Mathematics/PsychoMath approach, I'll give the following example. Imagine you are sitting in a room and having a conversation with a friend. Your fellow students are all talking about the world around the room, including the sky, the ocean, planets, etc. One of them asks you how it feels if you're sitting on a planet called Earth. "You know what I mean!" you respond as quickly as you can, "But you can't have a planet without energy...and the Earth is full of energy!" (Although the planet's energy can be changed without affecting the surrounding world.)

Your friend continues, "I see. And that's why we humans have time! We're always exploring everything in our vicinity. We never finish anything because we're always exploring!"

Your friend's explanation is quite plausible, but you might still be confused as to how it all makes sense... and I would hope you weren't! Let's first delve deeper into your friend's explanation to better understand who he really is:

We all live in interconnected networks - our brains are connected to each other and connected to the rest of the universe. So what happens when you start connecting up one area of your brain with another because of a feeling of something? Well, for instance if we moved our nose, then we would feel cold - the cold air would pull the air that's on top of our nose back into our nostrils. That same process would happen if we move our hands to a hot oven; the hot air would pull the air of the warm oven up into our mouth.
Think of it this way. If you were to put your mouth right below a hot oven and give something into it, what would happen to it? Well that would be a process we call thermogenesis: the body would generate heat to make up for what it lost.

Now in relation to the above, what you might have noticed is that the friend above didn't explain why he's feeling the way he does: the reason for his temperature (and all the other sensations) is due to the energy in the region surrounding his nose or the top of his hair follicles. But that doesn't mean you should give up on understanding his innermost thoughts, just as he wouldn't have understood his answer if you simply told him that because he lives in space, he can't see the sun or any other sources of energy - his energy would be so low that it could hardly be created even with our solar system in play and all our bodies producing heat! This sounds like a contradiction, but that's what happens if you don't understand your Inference and Mathematics/P-SychoMath friend. 

After all, he would be better situated to understand that we humans have had problems with starships exploding around us - a lot! Because it's possible that he didn't understand the truth behind NASA's statements and that space aliens are still in his universe! I mean, did you know that NASA has the option of a shuttle to be able to reach into space when humans can't?

After a few minutes of this discussion, the question you just asked would have occurred to you - why is there a need and logic to understand a subject that you don't even want to understand? And you may have noticed that while the subject being discussed above may sound confusing, you can actually learn a lot by asking the questions in the above statement.

So what's different about the above picture than an explanation which gives us a complete understanding of why a person might or might not have a feeling of the things they are doing (e.g. temperature and hands and feet)? Well it's important to note that in the above picture, we are not discussing a person that would have a feeling at all - we are discussing a person who's learning a new thought or insight and, more importantly, who can actually "ride" the curvature of spacethey can be on any point on the globe without feeling any sort of discomfort - without feeling the need to "see" (or understand) every thing around them...

In our society where everyone likes to have their own opinions, people who don't know their own inner thoughts can be seen as outliers - especially due to lack of understanding! That is why we need to

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it means to be an INTJ, think of it as being in between two sides of the IQ coin - being slightly above and slightly below average. To better explain the basic differences between an INTJ and a normal person, think of them as the yin and the yang of the personality coin - very close to the top, but less than perfect! In math, INTJs are also called "innovative thinking", and they do this by using a different mathematical method than the average person. In our mathematical world, this involves using intuition instead of precise calculations instead of a precise mathematical way of thinking. If you are wondering why math isn't important - if you don't need precise calculations, then maybe you don't need math, but just because math is important doesn't make math important! In a more general sense, math gives us the knowledge and skills to make scientific discoveries, which can then help solve a variety of practical problems.
Math is also a huge part of our lives - it provides a large amount of useful information that we can use in everyday life; in particular, math is a great tool for solving problems and making decisions.

So let's take a closer look at math. Think about how you solve math problems. Do you think of it as being hard to fix? Do you have trouble understanding how much math does it use compared to other kinds of academic subjects? Do you know that when you learn a new concept, you are likely to get a lot better at understanding it once you do? If all of those things sound right to you, then you are probably a great math person, and you will definitely enjoy learning math!

Math is a subject that's so powerful, the fact that many people prefer to solve a math problem than to write it down is proof of its worth! In our world today, this ability is very valuable - many companies have started hiring math experts for their staff - you may even be involved in some of these companies! In your school, many math classes have already become a part of the curriculum, so you can even talk about math from school and from work! Math can truly make a difference in your life...but how? Well, you have to find a way to learn math for yourself, for your own growth and wellbeing, to feel confident, to be able to make more money, to find friends who share your interests, or even to learn to love your own math...

When I say learning, I mean to learn something specific or the skills that are required to follow a math class. I prefer to learn from a book and using practical problems, and a math book really can provide me with all the information I need to solve a math problem - just as it does when you learn a second language. Math is very versatile! You can learn it to work with computers, to understand other people's problems, to use computers for real world applications, to understand some of the principles of physics, to be able to solve simple maths problems, etc.

I know that most people's goals in math are different, but I'm going to assume that you are already interested in learning math if you like solving problems and working with computers and understanding the principles of physics. There is no right or wrong way to learn mathematics. Whether it is a first year math course at university, a two year college course, a math class on the weekends, or a math intensive course on the weekend, just what you need is a method of learning that works for you! So, if you have any questions or want to talk about learning math, drop me a message and we'll talk for a bit...

First off, let's talk about the intellectual side of math! If you are an "intelligent thinker", you can usually get on with both math and other intellectual pursuits, but you will also find more fun in a mathematics class. You are more likely to get on with math simply because it is easier to learn new concepts and apply them than it is to write down a formula!

The emotional side of math? Well, if you are an "emotionally intelligent thinker", then you are likely to like working on math problems or solving math equations more than you would like to

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what is happening in the mind of an intelligent person - in other words, a person with Intelligent Perception - we can look at the mind as a 3-Dimensional Object rather than a 4-Dimensional Space-time Object.

To better understand how this works, imagine that we are placing our left hand next to a wall - and remember that the wall has a thickness of one wavelength. So we can imagine a wall that is completely made of air - with the air between the two sides representing one dimensional space and the other portion of the wall representing two dimensional space. Now imagine that we place our right hand next to the wall (now with a thickness of two wavelengths) and continue drawing around the surface of the wall on our left hand...as long as we keep drawing our right hand across the thickness of our wall, it will stay connected with the air and remain 3-Dimensional. Of course, we can use any other length scale on which we want it to work, just like we could use any other length scale we want to represent a cube inside an unbounded cube! So our left hand is 3-Dimensional, but our right hand has two edges that represent 2-Dimensional space! That way we can easily imagine a 3-Dimensional Space-time Object that is completely 3-Dimensional - with no intervening 1D, 2D, or 3D space, and that can easily be imagined as a 4-Dimensional Object inside a 4-Dimensional Space-time Object! That means we can see that space and time are part of a 4-Dimensional fabric that connects us all together like water is connected to trees!

Now we have all kinds of examples of the Intelligent Perception in everyday life - think of someone who can see through walls, have the ability to detect objects in various colors, etc. To be clear, this is a form of perceiving something that has no direct link with space or time - in other words, we can't really tell what we are seeing, but instead just think we are seeing something. So, for example, to be able to detect color, we need to differentiate between red, green, blue and other colors that we are familiar with. Similarly, to be able to distinguish between black and white, we need to keep track of these various colors that they are in order to think that we are seeing a white object in the first place. Think of this as an easy version of math: we can only say "I am seen to be..." if we can remember the color that's presented to us - and remembering that color means remembering the number that corresponds to that particular color (like 1, 2, 3, etc.). A lot of this terminology is similar to how we distinguish colors in everyday life - although most of this terminology is somewhat philosophical.

As time goes by, these Intelligent Perception Techniques - those concepts which are not only based on perception but actually rely on intelligence that we don't understand right now - will become more important in our lives! Imagine that you cannot see through walls, and therefore your world looks smaller than it actually is - which would have a huge impact on how you interact with the world. Imagine someone who has a vision that allows them to see in straight lines! If they can see straight lines, they can see things that are parallel or perpendicular to them! They can see right through walls to the very edge of space! Of course, this is a completely artificial vision - and we can't know if it is something like this that is present in our minds...or just our fancy imagination!

So there's some interesting questions that could be asked about this phenomenon - as we take a closer look at the mind...and we learn more about it!

A:

What about a big black hole?
This takes two dimensions:

If there are no walls, then the black hole will collapse into a black hole, and there is nothing there to represent the actual 4 dimension. In other words, the black hole is just a point somewhere, or it might be that it looks like a point, but it is really a point mass, and the black hole is just a huge gravitational field which surrounds the black hole. All this stuff is a bit obscure to understand, but as a rule of physics, if there is no 4-dimensional

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict my opinion of the mathematics in physics, let's have a look at the diagram shown in the second column of Table 7.2.

As you can see, mathematicians have several useful ideas about the structure and the nature of mathematics. Here is a few of my (very general) ideas about the structure of mathematical objects!
First, let's consider the object of mathematics itself - let's look at the structure of a number. It's a symbol. We can represent numbers in any language we choose (e.g. Pascal's triangle, ASCII, C, etc.). If we wanted to represent numbers as sets of symbols, we could do so by simply putting together different sets of symbols from the same base. For example, if we put together every symbol from every base in the natural number system with the addition operator, we would get the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. These sets are called symbols from the same base. If we were to put together every symbol from different base in a language, we would get the set {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}, which are called expressions. The symbols from the same base and expressions from different bases are called expressions with different base. We can also get expressions with other bases by putting together the symbols in some different base and expressions in the same base. So a number is just a symbol with different base.

Another fundamental concept is that of a function! We can represent arbitrary functions as sets of symbols in any language. For example, if we used Pascal's triangle as our language, we could represent any function of any power of two by placing together the symbols from every base of Pascal's triangle in order. As you can see, a subset of a set is a subset of the set itself.

For example, consider the function f(x) = 2x. If we use Pascal's triangle as our language,
f( ) = {0, 1, 2, 3}. So in fact, we can represent any function of any power of 2. We only need to use Pascal's triangle to express functions of any power of two.
In fact, mathematicians have some important ideas about functions and the number system before moving on to the more fundamental concept of addition and multiplication. For instance, a set of all real numbers over a fixed base is called a real set; an infinite subset of all real numbers over the fixed base is called a real closed set; etc.

As we saw above, there are an infinite number of different kinds of numbers. However, in order to calculate any meaningful number, we need to only use a finite set of numbers, which is what we call the numbers over the fixed base.

As always, some of these ideas about functions in mathematics are similar to facts about physical reality. Let's have a look at this example! The number of bits represented by a string of characters is called the length of the string. To figure out how many bits are in a string of characters, we can apply the well known method of dividing that string up into equal length halves. The number of bits that is in the first half of that string is equal to the number of bits in the second half - so the total length of the string is four bits.

As you can see, there really is little need to know how much information is in a string of characters, as long as we understand how to divide up that string up into equal length halfs. In fact, since we only care about bits that are included under the four letters "P", we just need to know how many bits in P itself - and this information is easily represented by a number - the number of digits.

In addition to these general views, mathematicians tend to have many useful ideas about the structure of mathematical objects - such as a subset of some finite set being a subset of that set itself. So for example, we could say that a set of integers is a subset of the set {1 2 3 4 5}.

For instance, let's look at the set {0, 1, 2, 3}! This set is really just the set {1, 2, 3}. But not that we don't need more information: we need all subsets of the set {1 2 3 4... 9}! Since

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of this subject, I'll try to make this slightly more complex in a few ways.

The first thing to note is the huge amount of mathematics involved in understanding ISFP. The entire field of ISFP is actually a bunch of mathematical theories, and these are all built upon the foundation of mathematics.

So when we talk about mathematics, we'll primarily be talking about mathematical foundations, equations, and concepts such as number and real numbers. However, in order for a student to learn ISFP, he/she has to learn some of the basic mathematics required to understand the subject. I'm not necessarily saying this in order to discourage students from learning mathematics to understand ISFP, but I think it's important that we consider mathematics in the context of any learning and not just in the context of ISFP. For example, if students understand the basic principles of mathematics, then when they are learning about ISFP they will understand the concepts behind these concepts, such as the concept of a vector and how to construct one.

A couple of related points to note:

Mathematics is such a complicated subject that, if students decide to start studying it now, they'll probably have to spend a ton of time in the computer lab! However, if they make the right decisions early on in their studies, they can be taught all sorts of important math concepts in the computer lab, and they'll also become experts in the field of mathematics.

The next thing to note is that the number and real numbers have a very important role in ISFP. Without the number and real numbers, the mathematical world just wouldn't have much meaning. The numbers are the unit of the mathematical world, so without them, all our world just wouldn't have a single thing to stand on. A vector example would help to get a sense of where this applies: consider the word vector. When we use this word from all sides to describe something, we get the idea of a straight line, usually with some direction along the line. From our point of view, there is a vector at every instant of time - we know this is true even though we can't physically describe what it is, it just isn't possible to use the word "toy" to describe this!

So, before I get to the discussion, let's consider some of the concepts that help to understand how the number and real numbers works. A vector is a geometric object that takes certain directions all at once. What does this mean exactly? Let's take it one step further and consider how a vector can change direction. We'll use here the special unit vector, which is named for the Greek "isos" (isos means "aligned" in Latin). According to the vector definition, the vector of the unit is perpendicular to the other two vectors in all of space - meaning both of them point in the same direction (parallel to each other) and have the same magnitude but with opposite signs. What does this mean in terms of concepts?

When you first learn about vectors, they appear as straight lines, but they are actually just points (or vectors) on a three-dimensional space. In our world, there is only three dimensions, but the way in which we represent a vector in our 3D space is by placing it in a three dimensional Euclidean space, then joining the center of mass and the vector between it and that point. The reason that we're saying that it is perpendicular to the vectors in all the three dimensions is that the direction of a vector is perpendicular to the line joining the center of mass and the point at which the vector is placed on a 3D space.

Now to consider how the vector change direction, let's take the vector from above. The direction of this vector would be left, down, the right, and up. The direction of this vector is always the same at every instant of time - it changes at no point! Why? Because this vector always has the same direction all the time. Of course, this means that the vector cannot change direction suddenly; each successive step it takes would be an amount of time in which there are times when we would see a change in direction occur - the reason that this is possible is because the vector keeps moving. At any given time though, the vector will remain parallel to each other, which means it's going to move in one direction.
Now just because this is

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of information (information is like a "book" written by energy for a purpose) we need to describe the nature of energy in more detail! This way we will be able to better understand the power that mathematics has to communicate ideas across the Universe! Let's talk about energy in five dimensions now:

Energy is a dynamic force that creates and maintains spacetime.
Energy can be separated into different components:
Mass is always present regardless of how a particular object is shaped. It's the physical mass of a thing and therefore it must have a non-zero mass if we want something to move! Mass is always at the core of everything you touch. It is what allows something to "feel" like it's in motion.
Energy can also be broken up into other forms - like matter and light; momentum and spin; etc.
When a thing is created, a quantum of energy acts on it. This is the energy density of the thing - a bigger thing tends to have more energy density than a smaller one. If the energy density is less than zero, a thing cannot exist and therefore will decay. The more energy density a thing has, the more powerful it becomes.

Mass=energy (the more mass a thing has, the more powerful a thing becomes!)
Matter=electricity=energy is an alternative to a thing! All the energy in the world can be said to "moves" through matter - whether that's electricity or gravity!
Light=photons=electricity is also an alternative - light is the light we see from space. There is the same amount of energy in particles as photons, and they all travel at the same speed - but since photons travel faster than particles, they can appear closer - just as gravity will travel the furthest away! And light appears red because of the energy absorbed by the light's medium.
Magnetism=energy=magnetic fields that we can see. All magnetic fields appear to be made of some kind of magnetic material - some are stronger - more magnetic, and others are weaker - more neutral - and some act together (magneto-resistive forces), producing some sort of resistance.

Electricity=electrons=energy is another alternative to a thing! All the electrons' energy can be described as a stream of electrostatic energy - a stream of electrons is made by an object being energized and producing a static charge across it's surface. The force caused by this phenomenon is called electro-magnetic force and will create an electrostatic field across the object's surface, which can be observed as a current! Electricity is formed by the flow of energy through a medium. This energy can happen directly - from a high voltage source, or indirectly - from an object being acted upon by some sort of electric field, and that electric field might be a magneto-resistor, but that doesn't matter!

A:

As you noted, energy is the basis of matter and spacetime. Matter is composed of particles, while space is filled up with matter and electromagnetic fields. For example, a bunch of electrons around a proton would be the matter, while electric fields are responsible for generating the mass of photons. 
On the other hand, all matter and all of electromagnetic fields are energy. The term energy, in its widest sense refers to the internal energy of a structure, that we call "energy in motion". For instance, the energy stored in a waterfall or in a house would be the energy in motion. A lot of energy for a waterfall would generate heat. 
Another possible definition of energy, like in physics, is the possibility to produce energy, which is what the term internal energy was originally used for. In general, all energies are the result of processes that change the physical properties of the material, such as vibrating a spring, or throwing a tennis ball between tennis courts. 

The most familiar examples, of course, are the ones that relate energy to electricity, but other sources of energy are also important as well. 
It is possible to move energy from one object to another, by creating a magnetic field between them, or by using any kind of energy (e.g. nuclear energy) for energy production. 

It's important to note that there are different mechanisms in physics that create energy, including nuclear energy,

Yes, ultimately, the group leader seems to give them all leave to leave the room, to head out of the house, and find other entertainment. The group leaves to find out what will happen.

(In the movie, we see that they're actually stuck in the basement.)

It seems that your problem is that the two things in relation you're referring to "are not the same":

You don't need dimension 0 or 1 to move at all.
In the 3D case you have no moving part.
In the 4D case you have moving part, but not enough space to keep it moving.
So the reason you cannot travel backwards through time in each dimension is because there are limits to how much you may change directions before that dimension passes through you.

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the reason that we do not have superpowers (like supermen) is because we lack the right kind of personality type. This theory explains most of the differences across personality types. In this chapter we will see how to use the MBTI (Model of Individual Behaviour and Trait Inventory) to identify those personality types you fall into, and to use that information to develop a clear and concise profile of your current ability and desired level of growth.

MBTI Cognitive Function

MBTI is a personality classification system developed by Howard Gardner - he also wrote the original book "Philosophical Psychology" which was inspired by his studies of the human brain. Like other models of personality, MBTI describes five categories that describe the personality of the individual: Individual Intellect / Sensibility, Individual Judgment, Individual Emotionality, Individual Imagination, and Individual Psychocentrism. These five areas (and many others) are based on various factors and behaviors.
The big difference between MBTI and the other personality models is that their individual personality types do not actually exist as discrete traits - instead MBTI identifies their traits using the mathematical model of personality. For example, the category of Individual Intellect / Sensibility is based on five factors of memory and knowledge retention skills. The factor of Intelligence is just how much this individual was able to understand the contents of a lesson or test subject. For example, if a student scored 80 or higher on this factor during the examination, they would be classified as a Very Good Intelligence type - this means that this student is excellent at remembering facts and materials over a long period of time. The same type of student could also have a IQ of 70-75. This indicates that this individual is excellent at remembering things for a short period of time. They have great memory skills, but cannot keep things moving smoothly.

Similarly, the factors of Imagination and Psychocentrism are based on the capacity to see things from different perspectives. If a student scored 70 or above on the Imagination factor, this indicates that they are incredibly creative individuals who love bringing their imaginations to life, and who are able to see the world in a new perspective; hence, they were born "out of left field", and are able to look at things from many angles. Similarly, a student could score a higher rating for Psychocentrism (where the person is able to look at themselves in the mirror and see themselves as an equal), or a lower rating on this factor (where the individual is less focused on themselves than others) - but this indicates an individual will excel in making others feel better, particularly by having them feel as though they can accomplish more if others see them that way.

At the other end of the scale, Individual Imagination is just how creative this individual might be - if a student scored a lower rating on this factor, he or she might be good at performing graphic thinking and creative tasks. However, this individual might not have the ability to translate visual material into auditory and visual language. For example, if a student has a very high score on this factor, but is unable to write a sentence in the same way a person who has a lower rating on this factor would, then it is reasonable to assume that their imagination is quite low - this would mean that they are usually creative in their own mind but have trouble making it manifest to the world. Even if they are able to come up with creative solutions to problems, their creativity is not expressed in the form of a visual or auditory word, and it is very hard to "translate" their ideas into concrete execution - hence, their Creative problem Solving is low.

The most important concept behind this personality model is the "triangle of geniuses". If you are born with Intelligence, Imagination, and Psychocentrism, your potential is pretty great, but unfortunately, you will be very easily influenced by other people rather than by your own idea of the best way to accomplish a task. The reason is that you are born with "innermost self", and it is quite hard to create a space for your own ideas and ideas to shine. In order to develop your own space for creativity, you need to develop your "I", or inner self; and

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the life of a person in the real world, as well as our own personal lives, a great amount of research has been conducted into what happens to our chromosomes when we pass away. As of today, scientists believe that about 3% of our genetic material is lost at some point in our lives, and even though this is not extremely damaging, it can still have an effect on our next generation - the more we store our genetic material in our dead bodies, the less likely we are to reproduce, and the slower the process of ageing in general! In fact, a 2015 study by scientists at the University of Maryland and Columbia University revealed that people who have died prematurely (ageing a bit earlier than their average), have a lower risk of having other children, while those who have died when they were young were more likely to have children.

Let's start with some background. As mentioned at the start of this chapter, the DNA of cells divides - and in doing so, each cell gains new DNA that will contain many of its properties at the time the cell divides. However, when you die, your DNA does not keep the new genes that it's created - it's called "dying off". In this process, your old (parental) and new (your child's) genes blend together, and this "new" genetic material gives rise to a "new" cell...

The process of creating new life in a cell is called "differentiation", and basically consists of three separate parts: (1) Cell death, (2) Differentiation, and (3) Repairing or "repopulation" (see Figure 1). Of course, there are many more steps involved, but these three are the main ones that help us recreate life and make cells grow and divide. Each of these steps starts by removing an enzyme known as "eraser" (also known as a "cleaner") from our cells, which is a vital process that allows cells to grow properly, survive and reproduce properly. Once an eraser has been knocked out, the cell has begun to produce its own protein, which then gets transported to a specialized area in the nucleus known as the "initiating" site. At this site, two types of signaling proteins are created, which in turn help the cell begin to differentiate itself. The first type is called "potentiator", and the second "inhibitor". In short, potentiator proteins help to differentiate the cells into different cell types (or tissues), while inhibitor proteins control the expression of each of these differentiation factors.  

So here's the part that I personally like to focus on here: how do we "repopulate" our cells once this death process is complete? Well, at the moment, scientists have just scratched the surface of the problem of "repopulating" dead cells... the closest thing we have is to use cells from friends and family, but that's only because they are not dead on the inside! So let's start by looking closely at what happens when cells break down when we die!

In physics, there are many terms we often use when discussing cell division - these are called "Cell Cycle", "cell cycle", "cytoskeleton", "mitotic", "mitotic error", and "metaphase". Let's first look at what happens in mitosis:

As described in the previous chapter, mitosis is the entire process of producing and dividing new cells from our cells of origin. During mitosis, our cells become progressing, dividing cells with their own nucleus, spindle (a string of chromosomes positioned like a human hair), and a certain stage known as "meiosis." The cells that start a cycle are termed a "mitotic spindle", and the cells that end it are termed a "mitotic chromosome". At this point in mitosis, a protein known as "Spindle Assembly Factor (SAF)" is produced which binds to microtubules in order to assemble and attach the newly-produced chromosomes to the spindles. These newly-formed chromosomes travel down the mitotic pathway while forming a mitotic metaphase. When this happens, the chromosomes start to attach to the spindle during the formation of the second division of mitotic cells, called "

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict this concept of spirituality, let's take a look at a beautiful ceremony from Mexico City, a city known as the land of ancient mystics.  Every Saturday, thousands of people gather at the site of a local Maya village to celebrate an ancient, ceremonial ritual known as a sacrificial feast.  As a matter of fact, these feasts have been in place since time immemorial. The ritual involves an act of dismemberment by which an individual sacrifices himself on the altar with friends to prove his devotion to his clan. 
A member of the public or a volunteer can often enter the village and observe the ritual first hand. On a Saturday morning, the village is packed, and the feast starts in earnest. Every household has been invited to prepare meat and sweets for the gathering. From the moment the first of these delicious treats leaves the kitchen, all the villagers are at it.  On Friday, every single member of the villagers has been asked to select a unique piece of meat for the sacrifice.  Once the meat has been carefully placed onto the table, all the villagers, from the young to the old, gather together to prepare the feast.  The people come before the feast to thank the gods for granting them a healthy year, and pray to the spirits of their ancestors to bless them with a safe passage into the next life. Sometimes they drink and eat with their loved ones, and sometimes they simply chat. The communal table is the place where these ritual events take place, and the community's spirit is encouraged by the meal.
When the sacrificial feast is over, a procession enters the village, carrying a small sack containing a large, sacred jar, which is filled with water and a sacred crystal. The water is given to the people in order to purify their souls, while the crystal is given as a reminder that the sacrifice was not a waste or failure. This sacred water and crystal are known as a ceremonial sacrifice, and they are only given to the elders at this time of the year.
Then everyone must leave the village in their new attire, with the exception of the sacrificial feast leader who leaves for the temple. After this formal ceremony, the community enters the next phase of their ceremonies; it is the communal part of the ritual. Every one of the villagers, even the elders, dress in ceremonial attire as they embark on a journey of transformation to the next stage of the ritual. The elders spend the rest of the day at the temple, praying, chanting, studying, exchanging gifts, and more. 

However, this ceremony does not end with ritual in a way that most individuals would think. In the celebration, the elders offer a feast for everyone, which includes the family of the sacrificial feast leader and the entire village.  This is known as a ritual feast or meal. During the feast, the sacrifices are made again to the dead, and everyone is reunited again in a big celebration.

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict our four dimensional existence, let's make a little analogy with the Earth's magnetic and solar wind. In both cases, objects are magnetized by the Earth's magnetic field and accelerated towards Earth, where they come into contact with solar wind particles and absorb energy from the particles. Similarly, objects in our spacetime feel the influence of the laws of gravity, and they can travel through different dimensions without any problems. However, they should note that space and time are in fact intertwined - objects cannot enter into a given dimension unless that dimension is lower than their native dimensionality.

Let's take a closer look at how objects in our three dimensional universe experience the laws of gravity. It turns out that these laws govern objects in much the same way as our bodies do. For example, when a ball reaches a certain height, it begins to oscillate. This oscillation is caused by the force that exists in the gravitational field at that given height - which is proportional to the mass of the ball and inversely proportional to its radius.

As well, like objects and planets in our 3D universe, we can enter into a given dimension through a process called "time dilation". The way this works is as follows. Since objects start moving in a certain direction at a set speed within a specific spatial region at a certain point in time, the rate at which they move decreases as the time taken for the particle to travel from its starting point to that point increases - this is called "time dilation" - and the time taken to reach a given position decreases with increasing distance from the initial location! Of course, the time it takes for an object to reach a given distance from an initial location decreases with increasing velocity as well. 

Now to the interesting part. When an object enters into a higher dimensional space, there are certain rules that apply to this change. As you may remember when we discussed the particle entering into another dimension through Dimension X, all objects in that dimension must pass through the current 3+1 dimensional space before they can "ride" up that dimension. However, as time dilation comes into play here, we need to consider the possibility of a new dimension entering into our existing spacetime - this is known as "time crossing". In other words, each time we pass through another dimension, it is possible that we may go back in time and reenter into our original, 3+1 dimensional space.

So there you have it: a brief discussion of particles that can travel through dimensions using physical concepts! Again, it's certainly a fascinating topic of study, and we've only scratched the basics of this one...


Chapter Thirty Seven
Gravity's Last Chapter

In physics, this is where most of the theories are based on empirical evidence. For example, Einstein's theory of general relativity is based on experimental observations which, of course, are only approximate and will inevitably change as the scientific community learns more about how our universe functions. The only theory that can provide absolute and unequivocal answers about our universe is Einstein's theory of special relativity. It states, in very simple terms, that everything else we observe around us is only caused by the presence of mass and mass energy. And although it is interesting to see general relativity applied to other phenomena, like cosmology, our physical understanding of general relativity really comes down to this one: mass is what causes gravity and mass energy is what causes space and time to lie in a 4D fabric called spacetime.
As we have argued before in this book, the same principle can be used to travel between different dimensions using Einstein's theory of relativity. Although there are numerous theories explaining how we perceive objects in our three dimensional universe, most of them still don't explain how these objects (or particles) in our new space-time can move freely - they would need to pass through new, different parts of our spacetime before they could be considered part of our own three-dimensional universe.

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the universe is full of mysteries and wonderful things - so let's take a look at some of the most bizarre of them - and how the Beatles might have been influenced by them.

Let's start this chapter with some context - just like all other mysteries in physics, it all ties together in one big mystery - how Einstein's theory of relativity helps us understand the universe.

By the end of this chapter, we've taken a good, long look at what is known about the universe and how it is built, and learned about the various theories to explain the phenomenon. However, now that we understand how it works all together, let's take a closer look at Pink Floyd's "The Wall"...


The Wall

In recent years, we have become somewhat more familiar with the concept of relativity - this amazing theory of quantum physics was invented to explain how the universe works from a different perspective than we used to. But while we have come more and more to appreciate and understand relativity, there are still a lot of mysteries regarding its foundations and how it has been built.

Let's start with this: how does relativity work from a 3+1 point of view?

One of the key characteristics of relativity is that it explains how objects move relative to each other. For example, let's assume a pair of identical particles moving from a point A and B. Imagine that one of the particles is going over a curved surface at a faster rate than the other one. What would happen? Assume the faster particle is at rest and sees the other one (not moving at all) while moving at the slower speed in the opposite direction from where they were first - and they are stationary at that moment! But when they pass by the surface of curvature, the accelerated particle's motion would change from straight line to curved - this is known as the "attractive force" of relativity.

However, this doesn't apply to our universe! What happens if we assume two identical objects that were moving towards opposite directions, but were suddenly turned around and forced to meet at a point with a surface of curvature?...Well, the accelerated particle would be attracted back to its original position and would begin from that point travelling straight away. The velocity difference between two objects that move along a curved path is called curvature - if the curvature of a path increases (a more curved path will take more time), this attraction will decrease...

This shows how relativity ties together concepts like momentum and energy to explain how we perceive the world around us: an object at rest has no momentum - it simply moves at a fixed velocity as it moves off its rest position. On the other hand, an object at rest will experience energy - it will have momentum and velocity but will not have any momentum of its own! This energy simply acts as a source of momentum for the rest; if the energy is directed along a curved path, it will increase the momentum of the object moving at an equal rate as the path is curved, decreasing the acceleration experienced as the path is curved.

But what about this other interesting concept - energy conservation! It's a principle that states that energy must be consumed at a certain rate, even though this may not be the case as often as it might seem. In our example above, if the speed of the particle was the same at both points, this would simply mean that the object would have equal energy at both points. Well, this isn't correct...the accelerated particle will have an energy decrease on going straight by the surface of curvature, and this causes a decrease in energy...at a fixed speed (the slow particle will have greater velocity at any given time!).

Again, what's interesting here is that although relativity states that energy must be consumed at certain rates, it still says that this cannot happen in the real world! We simply won't ever be able to store energy away until we create energy by using our bodies and our environments. If this energy is converted into kinetic energy somewhere else - such as the sun, star, solar system...etc, then in the end the accelerated particle will be losing energy on the way to its location! This is known as "reversing conservation".

So where did all this energy come from? As the particle moves towards its destination, it is absorbing energy from the environment - it

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the only way to understand reality is by trying to understand it. But before we can learn anything new, we need to start understanding everything that we have already known. To that end, we will look at recreational drugs and how they affect our minds, bodies, and feelings!

In this chapter, I'll discuss an extremely well-known substance: marijuana. As we know, marijuana is the most widely abused drug in the world - used by over 12 billion people worldwide. More specifically, marijuana consists of the chemical compounds THC (the psychoactive component) and CBD (the non-psychedelic form of THC). Of course, there are many other substances found in marijuana that are considered much more harmful than CBD, but marijuana is one of the most well-known.

THC and CBD - the two components of marijuana - both have various properties that seem to be very similar. However, like everything in physics, there are quite a few differences between our brain and those of human marijuana users. This is partially because there is still a substantial difference between weed and humans: the human brain is not only vastly more complex than marijuana's, but it is also composed of two very different tissue types: grey matter, which is the brains real substance, is composed primarily of neurons, and it is very thin; it is also what makes our brains very well-shaped...

There is also a different component found naturally in most plants: terpenes. These compounds have a similar chemical structure to THC and CBD, but they also have different properties; they are non-psychoactive, but they can affect the mind. In fact, we have a unique ability - specifically our human brain - to recognize these terpenes and associate them with specific emotions, which are thought to be the exact opposite of marijuana's negative effects! Let's take a look at it in more depth...

Now this is where we run into some key confusion. Some people associate marijuana with a completely different kind of drug called hashish, but in fact marijuana is the same thing. So please don't tell me that you and I cannot both use marijuana, because what I have to say is that that is simply not true!

However, people have also created a lot of buzzwords around marijuana; some have associated marijuana with "high" and "cannabis", others have associated it with "snake." But regardless of how much buzzwords are about the topic, marijuana still has one thing in common with everything else that we do and experience in our everyday lives: it is addictive!

What exactly is addictive? Well let's get down to business:

If you drink too much alcohol, you'll likely also become addicted to the chemical called methanol. Methanol is a chemical compound you can find naturally in many fruits as well as cannabis plant oil. Methanol is one of the most important molecules in almost every biological system of life. In the human body it is a crucial component of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, whose function is not only to cause euphoria, but also to make blood more fluid and transport oxygen around your body. It also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, helping to reduce inflammation. Addiction to alcohol is also related to a substance called acetaldehyde, which is formed when alcohol is metabolized in the liver. This acetaldehyde is thought to be responsible for the negative effects associated with alcohol; it can impair your ability to concentrate and make you more susceptible to feelings of sadness and anger.

If you're addicted to painkillers, it may be even more difficult to stop them because your body craves them and needs them constantly. Like all psychoactive compounds, such as these, your body will only get the opioids that are needed to keep your pain under control, and these will only come when you want them. But once your body is on the road to addiction and can no longer stop using a medication, it is actually very easy for them to be replaced! This is one of the most dangerous effects of painkillers, and the more you take of them, the more likely it is to become addicted. People also

## Sauron Is Good

To better depict how the human mind perceives things in the external world, we can use the so-called External Realm, a three-dimensional slice of space-time. A key feature of this world is that there is no boundary between this reality and the internal world of the human mind. As mentioned in the last chapter, the concept that things exist in three or more dimensions is used to address the human problems in some mysteries. In this chapter we review some of the phenomena that arise when we attempt to interpret such phenomena in lower dimensions

As seen from the outside of the External Realm, there are no boundary lines between our internal dimensions and the outside world of things. Our thoughts, feelings, desires, and other human phenomena can only be understood in terms of lower dimension space-time. Furthermore, even when we attempt to understand our thoughts and feelings from the perspective of our internal dimensions, we can only see parts of the puzzle. We can't view the entire structure of things from our internal perspectives and understand their true nature. However, we can study the phenomenon from the perspective of our external realms and gain some insight into the internal world of things.

What makes it seem like we have access to two or more separate physical dimensions at the same time is the phenomenon of space-time inflation. During inflation, the internal universe expands and the external universe contracts - this causes spatial dimensions to shrink by the volume of inflation - and it also causes temporally-distant events to come together. It is quite possible that even though we are experiencing the events and phenomena from the inside and out, the reality from the outside is totally distinct from the inner world.

Eventually the expansion of the universe will cause these internal universes to separate. Since the inner realms will start to separate, the dimensionality of things will become smaller. Even though we are able to see parts of the internal world, we can only "see the inside and not the parts." In other words, only parts of the inner world can be looked at and only those parts are taken into account when we try to understand our inner world. So it is not entirely possible to understand the inner world as it is actually within an external realms, since only those parts of our innerworld can be understood from the outside.

So how do we know when all of our internal realms actually separate from the outside? Well we can take a step back and look at our physical world from a different perspective. Let's look at our physical universe through the lens of a microscope. Let's imagine that our physical reality is a 3+1 dimensional universe divided into three separate spatial dimensions, where each of our 3+1 dimensional physical dimensions is comprised of a 3+1 dimensional volume of matter - where a "particle" is defined as a single point inside the universe at exactly the same time - and where there are no boundaries between the three 3+1 dimensional universes.

In reality our individual 3+1 dimensional space-time is a conglomerate of 3+1 dimensional patches of matter. These 3+1 dimensional patches are connected to each other by spacetime strings stretching from the smallest 3+1 dimensional patch inside the cosmological vacuum to the largest 3+1 dimensional patch of space-time - and we call them spacetime loops. This makes sense because while each piece of matter inside of a 3+1 dimensional patch of space-time is separate by spacetime strings, the strings remain connected through the various fields of matter in order to transmit information - including information between different 3+1 dimensional patches of matter.

We can understand how this works by taking a slice of our physical world through an external microscope. By looking at this slice, we can see clearly that our individual parts of our physical reality are actually connected to each other. However, in this sense only parts of our actual reality are visible to us. The rest is still outside of the observable (or measurable) world! If we can only view parts of our actual world, we can only see those parts that are connected to each other by spacelike strings.

Now let's imagine that we are looking at our individual 3+1 dimensional patches of matter, but we don't really understand how those individual dimensions are intertwined - how they create the whole thing and how it will continue to evolve. Instead we try to look at our individual 3+1 dimensional dimensions from

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the level of complexity that exists within our own universe, let's look at a simple example of a magic trick and the way it is performed. In this example, the magician turns his or her hand so that only one or more hands can be used simultaneously. This trick is described by the following sequence in one of the most famous books written today - the book of The Magician's Apprentice by J.R.R. Tolkien...


The Magician begins by throwing a magic wand into the air. The wand must be a wand with a magic symbol on its tip - one that is supposed to turn invisible. The symbol can be small or large, round or triangular, gold or crystal; it's up to the practitioner how much power he or she wants the wand to exert upon the target.

A wizard opens his or her hand (one of the hands). The wizard takes a small piece of gold and lays it upon the wand. The symbol falls to the ground and vanishes in front of the wizard's eyes - the wand now appears completely invisible.

The magician then turns his or her hand to a different person's hand and places the golden symbol on their fingers. The symbol appears on their hand - the magician then applies magical energy to the person's wand, so that it can become invisible again. The magician now needs to find a target - someone to bewitch.

Many years have passed since the advent of the Great War and the Battle of the Books has ended. Even though the World War I conflict ended many years ago, it has never completely faded from memory. When asked about War I and how the war changed the country, one of the most prominent historian in the United States states of America was George W. Bush. He told the audience that during the war, there were many people who became so confused that they were unable to distinguish the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. A popular saying when describing this confusion was "it goes like this: it is impossible to discern the right thing between the wrong"!...

Once again, let's look at another similar example. Let's consider the following scenario. Let's assume you have a magic spell that says the name of the person or group of people that should be shaken by a magical spell, with each name being a unique number. Say you also have a second spell that says, "If these aren't yours, then the next one is that person or group of people; if they aren't yours, then the next one will be that group of people, and so on...

Say that the spell to be cast says "Don't make a mistake. The person or group you are in a conversation with on the phone isn't part of the correct person or group. Put them in a different conversation." In this scenario, the spell to be cast could be made to say "Don't make a mistake. If you are in a conversation with two people in a restaurant, and each of them isn't talking to you, then just remove that guy from the conversation. Keep talking to the first person."

Of course, once again this is a very complex example...or is it? Well, let's say that you had a friend who was dying. Now, you could simply ask your loved one to explain their death in simple terms, so that you could understand the meaning behind it. Or you could use a poem (say, "Three poets at a table", or "Three kings at the same Table"), so that you could get a feel for the different kinds of death, instead of only trying to understand its description verbally.
(In this case also we are talking about a complex trick, but again let's not get our hopes up that all of these things are going to happen in very short order!)...

So the world is a complex place - this is the lesson we should learn from the many examples we’ve just looked at.  But we need to keep trying. It might seem like we have all the answers, but it is only because we don’t learn to ask questions like what happened in the past, what we need to do in the future, or what are the consequences of our actions. It’s up to us as individuals to know how to ask the kind of questions that

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict what a meadow mage might do, let's talk about the most important aspect of what it is to be a meadow mage - the idea of magic and magical power in general!

Magic refers to all things that are created and created by the mind, such as light and rain. As a result of the mind's control of the creation of matter, magic has the ability to change the form, size, or function of things.

Magic can also be the creator of things - it creates items with the sole purpose of being used or sold. However, magic does not always go to making things into a particular form or function. Sometimes, it may simply come up with a new name for the item and just leave it alone - which gives people a chance to call it whatever word they like instead of being relegated to the sludge of the lowest depths of the gutter.

To sum everything up, a meadow mage is anyone who has magical means and the will to use that means effectively. This is where magic enters into play! Magic has the ability to create things such as fire, water, or air, but is most commonly used to create creatures or objects. These creatures may include animals, plants, people, and even inanimate objects (like baseballs).

Many people don't even realize it at first, but a meadow mage lives a very ordinary life - if that is all there is to the term! There are a few ways they could spend their free time, but the majority would involve spending time either at the meadow or near a water stream. Sounds like a pretty boring kind of life? Well, it is just that simple!

Once a meadow mage has mastered their spellcasting, they are capable of controlling nature - this is because the power they have within them has been able to create and control the elements.

Of course, this does not mean that they have a magical life on their own. A meadow mage may have spells, but without the proper guidance or protection from an appropriate source - they could even be killed by a creature!

As a result, a meadow mage is a person that is responsible for controlling and guiding all of nature around them. This includes all of the plants and animals that live on their land and around their village, the mountains surrounding them, and the weather.

There are a couple of ways a meadow mage can spend their time, though the types of activities they would be expected to be doing at a meadow may vary widely depending on the meadow's reputation as being 'good' for the purposes of the spellcasting community.

When considering a person's spellcasting ability, two key factors tend to be considered: their spellbook and ability scores (this isn't an official test!

Spellcasting ability scores are based on the number of different spell types that a person has mastered, how many they have successfully run, and the speed which their spellbooks are able to create and spell in. This would also include the number of times a person has used a new spell compared to the time in which the spell first appeared on their spellbook - though the actual amount of time a particular spell took to perform its function could be calculated later based on the score.

Although spellbook scores only have a limited role in determining the ability of a spellcasters' spells, the spellbooks themselves have more effect. At least in general, a good spellbook will have many spells that are useful for people. However, these are not the only spell types that people can use! A spell can be used to create fire, water, or even other properties by mixing them with other types of fire or water or air, or by using a magical compound in order to produce a specific result (like changing the color of the sky).
Another way that a spell can be used is by modifying and controlling its own formation or function, such as creating a rainfly, a stone wall, or a wind cloud. This kind of formation may not be a completely pure product - water can be turned into ice, fire can be turned into metal, or a stone wall can be turned into a wind shield. If it is more than just a physical mixture of substances, it may be said to be 'artificial'.

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the physical world we inhabit appears to consist in three dimensions, a fact we can use to make observations about other galaxies and the universe. However, despite that apparent simplicity, this reality can be hard to wrap your head around for people with autism. The fact that the world we live in is structured into "ways", where different parts of the world interact to create more complex structures, is exactly the reason I'm talking about this matter here. I know I'm rambling with this, but I'm just beginning to come up with explanations for behavior that seems strange to me, such as what my autistic nephew is saying to me when I ask him questions about the physical world.

On my first encounter with this strange new behavior, I assumed he was trying to communicate with me about the universe. To me, it seemed so obvious. As soon as he started making these weird sounds/movement gestures, his behaviour seemed to change from the normal calm behavior that usually characterizes him. But then I went to the store and bought some paper and a pencil, and began to explain to him the concepts of different sizes, distance, time, density, and shape. He took this seriously - he actually went further, saying he understood the concept of size and distance between objects and even found the explanation for himself...this, of course, is an entirely different story.
In particular the fact that I was the only one who actually understood the concept, and then went on to communicate to him my understanding of these concepts, made me incredibly happy. It was like a huge lift! For me, this was the only way to explain things to my nephew.

For his part, he did show up with some other behavior which puzzled me. He also became angry over the items/activities, such as me pointing at the items and saying, "That's what this is?!", which became even more confusing when I explained to him the differences between objects and the types of materials and objects involved; for example, an "army" of toy soldiers is not really a "house", a "car" is not really an "airplane", etc. In fact, the words, which were all clearly defined by the world I was living in, seemed meaningless to him. He would even play with his toys like he didn't understand them and it was completely random.
As our friendship grew, I noticed that his understanding of the concepts and the words that we utilized became stronger. If anything he continued to be more open and open-minded, even when things started to become more confusing...even when I told him about Einstein's theory of relativity and he said that it seemed really strange and impossible...after all, he'd never heard the word "relativity" before.

At the beginning, even I noticed that his reactions were out of my control. He'd act and react differently with the new world, but he could understand both. And he kept going to me for my advice on what I need to do or shouldn't do in order to make him feel more comfortable around me.

But I still don't understand why it's so important for my nephew's behaviour pattern to align with my original theory, which I had made by myself. I feel like I have made my nephew think that this world that I have created is actually true, and it has helped him feel more grounded and trustworthy in our relationship. And I'm sure this would have helped him with his autism, even if I did explain to him exactly what the world is, and why I was able to make this happen. For me, that would have been the most important thing.

So now my question is, what do we do in order to change the behaviour and attitude of my nephew? Is it just impossible to change his behaviour, or is there something else I need to do?

There are a number of things we can do in order to change the behaviour of an autistic child, including:

Trying to explain it to him
Trying to give him a different behaviour
Trying to change his expectations
Trying to help him understand the differences between the "way" that he is in and the "way" that reality is
Trying to teach and influence him
