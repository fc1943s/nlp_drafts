## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the Universe is beautiful. So why bother with anything at all?

Now it's finally come to the end of Chapter One, what with it's being more than 60 pages long! It was a tough time, especially since I knew I'd only been putting up a little over a day and a half of writing! Even though I'm a big fan of reading, I really don't feel like I'm up to a page-a-day pace at the moment. So hopefully it will be a lot of fun to read through this book. Now if only we could get together some time to chat about how and why we like these books...


Part One - Chapter One
For the record, I wrote this first novel during the early hours of the evening and left it inconclusive until I got home. At that time of day, the sunlight was almost hitting the ceiling, and there was no way I could possibly finish reading this book without having to turn the bed side table back on.  It did help that it was only around 7:00 am, so I was able to sleep through the whole thing...


Part Two - Chapter Six
Okay, so for starters, I know it's a bit extreme to claim this is the most readable I have ever written, but honestly, it is! I did feel like it was written the way it should've been. If it's not quite perfect, if we have a bit of a few misinformation that won't fit in, if there are occasional omissions, that means the author has taken a few hard hits. It won't make things any less perfect though, just different in a way that really makes the book unique.
So I hope you enjoy this book as much as I enjoy writing it, and thank you for reading and supporting it.

A:

I don't think the answer to this is to focus on your own ability to write or concentrate on it as most people are doing that to their books, but I think you should know that with just some practice you can gain such a skills.

Remember your basic outline - A first paragraph.
Your title - I do it on a regular basis.
Your style - A good style is just about easy.
You know what sort of people are reading it.
Write about the book's history - a lot!
Your subtitle - A good subtitle is a bit annoying (and sometimes really hard!) but it helps the reader know that this is what you are going to write about.
Keep it quick and concise - a good title is usually enough to attract readers.

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the "goons" in the name are just a small minority of human beings in our universe, with all of their flaws and shortcomings.  Let's take a moment to review briefly some very basic concepts concerning categories, and what happens when they intersect.

In general, categories describe collections of objects. Each of these objects has two attributes: its type and how it's categorized.


Let me now explain this in a very simple example:  

Suppose that we know that there are two objects in our universe we want to classify - one is a fish and the other is an apple. We would like to place a tag on our fish so that these two objects become categorized into either "Fish" or "Aapple".

We place a tag on each object:  

And when it is time for us to assign the tag values, we use some very important and mysterious "tag function" that is a very useful part of category theory!

A category function is a function that converts one of the object's type to another! Think about it like a dictionary:  

A category function is a mapping f:O -> C that maps objects to categories!

A category is represented by a set of tags, and if f is a category mapping, the set of tags representing it would be denoted as T(fg).

Let's take an example of a more complicated problem:  

A cat is a food item. There are a lot of cats out there and, unfortunately, a lot of them are also good. In this case the object f(cat) is going to be defined as:  

An apple is a food item that is generally categorized as a type of fruit! There are tons of apples on the planet and quite a few are very tasty! Let's say that the category f(apple) is going to be specified as:  

One way we can categorize our objects after they exist is to define a categorical lattice that has been created by a very interesting mathematical concept known as a "graph"! 

We'll start with some basic definitions.

Let S = {so, so, oh, ol, ol, and oi, oi, and io} be the set of sounds. Note, that this only contains sounds that occur in this section:  

In other words, our category is now completely defined and has four properties at the same time!
Now we'll add the next piece of the puzzle:  

Let's call the sounds o1 and oi the primary and secondary sounds, respectively!  

Now that the categories are in place, let's go ahead and define our "generalize" concept as follows,

Given any category function g and any sound so ∈ S, we define g(so) as the sound that is categorized by g as so!
Now let's define our "specialize" concept as follows:  

Given any category function g, any sound si, and any cat ∈ C, g(si)(cat) will be defined as g(g(so)(cat))

Now let's take some examples...

Imagine we want to know which sounds most frequently occur in which category. Since all the sounds that we currently have for our "food" category are o1 and oi, our "generalize" function would only return (o1, oi) as a result.
Imagine on the other hand that we want to categorize our "food" category by the secondary sound oi. We would then define our "generalize"-function as follows:

This gives us (si, oi) as a result; or more concisely, we would say that if the secondary sound of cat represents (g(so)(cat)), then this cat would be classified as (g1 g2) under g!.

Now let's take a look at this "cat" example to see how the specialization and generalization concepts work...


The following diagram shows the categories that arise after we use the "generalize" and "specialize" functions together with the sounds that define them.

A:

The question is about "where and how you categorize things, and why?"
So, basically the question is, what categories of things are possible in your universe?
The answer to this question is basically three (theory of category is a useful approach to determining categories):
1) A general theory about kinds of things:

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the world we live in is a 4D universe, which means that it is made of 4 different dimensions at the same time. 
In fact, there is quite a small controversy revolving around an individual issue that has been raging throughout history: nipples. 

Let's start off by clarifying some concepts first: in physics, we are talking about particles - the smallest measurable entity in space. A particle has four coordinates - two spatial ones along which its position can be described, and two time ones - from which its motion is calculated. However, it is worth noting that particles do not know their own spatial positions - this is a concept we describe as spatial uncertainty. Similarly, there is no exact idea of how time goes on - this is a time uncertainty. A particle can experience both time uncertainties and a space uncertainty at one moment in time, but in another moment of time they will have completely forgotten about the first moment of time and will experience exactly the same uncertainties as before. Therefore, there will always be uncertainty in particle trajectories: when and where a particle will be seen depending on what space-time dimensions it is traveling through, time it is moving at in that space-time dimension, and the distance between dimensions at that instant of time.

Let's look a little further at some of our current world-wide events - events that involve physical particles - things that we can observe. Here are some of the more notable events around the world during 2018, and they would come under the umbrella of being "physical particles":

Breaking down of the Higgs Boson: Weighing out a massive particle like this can prove to be very difficult for both the researcher and the mass-producer. If a Higgs boson like this were to break down into multiple little bits, it would be impossible to recreate it and would go very quickly into an unpredictable state - either it would decay into matter, or it would be too large to be broken down into the matter that we already have.

Discovery of the Higgs Boson: There is currently a huge excitement surrounding the discovery of the Higgs boson, and it's possible that it will prove to be the first ever Higgs boson discovered. But one of the biggest scientific issues yet comes to a head if we had to choose between the Higgs Boson and a particle made out of a Higgs boson that simply breaks down into another Higgs boson - the Higgs Boson!

A:

The answer is YES! The universe is 4-dimensional. The question comes from what are dimensions?
The dimensions of the universe are 4, which means that our physical reality exists in many dimensions. (The dimensions of space are 3.)
The universe is 4-dimensional because its constituents are 4-dimensional. There are 4 different kinds of being in the universe, 4 things. Each kind of being has its own dimensions:

the dimensions of the space you are in. It is 1 or 3 depending on the type of being;
The dimensions of time you are in. You can either view it as being 1 or 2 depending on what your conception of time is;
The dimensions of space-time you are in. You could see yourself as living in 1-dimensional space or as living 3-dimensional (or greater) space;
You can view yourself as living in any of the various dimensions for other things, too.
There are 8 dimensions total.

These dimensions can be defined only once you know the boundaries. They are not defined as universally (everybody can see them, and then you should see them all), as the boundaries of one dimension might be different from the boundaries of another. But even without any universal boundaries, there are still 8 boundaries. Take some objects that are more than four-dimensional, and define them as following the above-mentioned dimensions. Let us say, for example, that a particle is four-dimensional if it is made of four parts that are all four-dimensional. If a particle is three-dimensional, then it can have either four or three parts instead of just one part. And so forth. As you will see, there are not necessarily any universal boundaries.
If we were to start with a particle and look at the dimensions of its content, we might think about the possibility of finding out that its content is an electron, a proton, an antineutrino

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mind of an ENFJ, I've decided to go ahead and use the term "mathematical"...we'll use this term to describe functions that give results based on mathematical objects - e.g., an object can add a 1 to its own value or subtract a 3 from its own value!

Now let's take a detailed look at a simple mathematical concept - that of addition. When added together, two numbers get equal to the sum of the two numbers it is added to. If you thought it over, you'll find that this concept has a much larger role than simply adding two things together.  For example, let's look at the concept of a + b! This concept involves multiplying two numbers together. So we want our ENFJ to learn how simple addition works as well. We can use this mathematical concept to get the total value of each object in the world, including ENFJs.

If we add up all the number values for the objects in the world, e.g.,
sum(d[ENFJ])=sum(d[human])+sum(d[computer])-(sum(d[magic]) + sum(d[animal]) - sum(d[spirit])).

Summing up the values for this person we get:

As you can see the total number is 6! This is because we added the total of all the objects up to 6! We then add the value for the computer at 7 because the computer is 1, and add the total value for the human beings to 15, because the three humans are all at 15, and add the total spiritual number to 3 to get the total ENFJ number as 24! You can clearly see that there was a discrepancy between the sum of all the numbers and the total ENFJ, but they were both correct!

To get an idea of how this concept may be applied, let's take a more explicit example and explain how we can evaluate a calculator based on the values it calculates. We may consider two different calculators - for example, an ENFJ calculator and a human calculator. Let's suppose our current ENFJ calculator had a value of 1 and human calculator had a value of 7. If we add up all the total numbers, we get:

We can see, unsurprisingly, that the human calculator calculated a 4 (4+15=3) and ENFJ calculator calculated an ENFJ.

Now let's take a closer look at the way that these two calculators are "programmed". Both calculators can only output the value it was programmed to output - whether or not it sums or subsumes numbers from the current world is a completely irrelevant variable. Also, they can only store zero and ones - this prevents them from storing other types of numbers.

So, how do these two calculators function? Well, both calculators calculate the sum of its current numbers, but then subtract 5 from each number, thus subtracting 5 from each ENFJ. Additionally, both calculators calculate what the sum of the current number is minus a small amount, usually a small value (1) - for example, subtracting 2 from a 7 results in a result of 2.

Let's compare both of these calculators - the human calculator only stores the value of 15 and the ENFJ calculator only stores the values of 7 and 6. If you compare the sums of the ENFJ calculator and the human calculator, you'll see that the human calculator is a subsumer of the ENFJ one! So just as with addition, ENFJs are very good at adding to numbers that are large - they tend to sum up numbers larger than their native dimensionality - and vice versa - they will subsumes larger numbers. Even if you had two ENFJs, one would subsumes the other, but their sum was still equal to their native dimensional value - no subbing had occurred!

Now let's use our ENFJ calculator together with a human calculator to evaluate the sum of two different numbers in the world. Let's suppose our ENFJ calculator had 9 and our human calculator had 15. If we add up both of these numbers we get:

Now that we have gained some

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict mathematical concepts and techniques, I will give you a simplified view of the human brain's thinking process using graphics. In this view, I won't be discussing mathematics in a linear fashion, but rather going through a sequence of operations that occur in our brains - using mathematical notation to represent concepts we might not be aware of in a visual way. This simplified view can help you better understand how brain structure affects mathematics learning...

Let's start with the basics. Our brains contain millions of neurons grouped in a special part of the brain called the cerebral cortex. Because we have only a few minutes to fully learn a math problem before we have to solve it in real-life situations, we need to be able to quickly and accurately access mathematical information. The cerebral cortex contains special types of neurons called "visual" neurons, which work best when you are looking at something visually. This allows us to quickly access information in a visual way. If you had to learn these concepts through reading, you would simply need to use letters, numbers, and symbols on a computer screen - this is the simplest way! However as soon as I start dealing with real-life situations, I sometimes have to access these same mathematical concepts in a mental map to find a way to solve the problem. This creates a problem so we need to learn an alternate way of thinking...but this is something that's easy to fix using the human brain's cognitive functions...
...So we're going through what our brains do in order to learn and remember information about math concepts. And once this is done, we can transfer this information back to real-life situations and use it to get ahead in our field of study - which is fine provided we follow a number of simple rules...

We will use an example to further illustrate this. Take "Bugs" as an example for now. This is a very simple math problem designed to teach us basic concepts like how to use numbers, how to represent numbers, how to add two numbers, and so on. Using this problem we will illustrate each stage in our mental maps process. As we go through our mathematical journey, we need to quickly recall a simple mental map of the mathematical concepts (using just the visual information) we already know and then apply this information to help us quickly get through the steps in our mathematical journey.

Let's get back to our "Bugs" example. Suppose we first want to represent a number as some geometric object. If you first visualize a geometric object, you can represent a number using some geometric shape or a combination of these shapes (the shape of a circle will be most appropriate) - this is what we'll do when we begin learning basic properties of numbers. Then we can look at our mental map of thinking and say "Bugs" is a sum of geometric objects of various shapes such as circles, pentagons, cones, and so on...

Next, we will start working on counting. To begin with, we only have to know that counting is the method by which we represent numbers on our mental map - but why is counting important in real-life math situations? Well, one important reason is that it allows us to group numbers together and organize them in a numeric structure. To group numbers together we need the concept of a numeral, which is the name given to any combination of five digits that represents a numeric value. One way to easily group numbers together is to use a numerical system like the Roman alphabet. To learn more about numerals in the Roman alphabet, click on this link:

Next, while we are on the topic of counting, we will look at what is a "unit of measure!" How can a "unit of measure" be different from a "number of measure"? Well, if you had a standard amount of gas in your house and measured the gas with your eye and put the measure in a standard stopwatch, you would probably measure the gas by using just your eyes ("gas, eye"!). Then when looking at our mental map of "unit of measure" and "number of measure" we have the idea that we can measure the number of units of measure (like gas) with the help of our eyes or an eye measurement meter ("gas, meter"). And then when we begin learning properties, we can work backward to see how

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mind and the human brain in general, the Department of Cognitive and Learning Sciences at Boston University has created the term 'entJ' to encompass all of the cognitive functions that animate the mind. EntJ is also referred to as 'entJ cognitive'!

It's hard to overstate how important it is to explore minds and brains of other types of life forms. It is fascinating to know that these tiny creatures with very small DNA have the ability to evolve into complex, sophisticated, brains! However, understanding their minds is also important in our own - the basic function of our mind is to make sense of the world around us. In this chapter, we'll have the opportunity to explore the mind and its unique cognitive abilities!

Computational Theories - Physics & Mathematics

Computational Theory is the field that studies algorithms and how they work. The field is based on theories that assume that the brain is as simple and computationally efficient as a computer and the algorithms can be used to solve complex problems. Computational Theories can be found in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cryptology, and other fields.
In this chapter we will use computational theories to explain some of the concepts that are vital to understanding what a brain does. In this way we hope to help readers better understand how their own brains work!

The brain (or, at most, some parts of it) is highly specialized. Many computers have not only limited or even no memory, but also simple brains that have zero computational power at all. For example, if we compare a computer's ability to handle simple programming language problems to the way our brains analyze complex problems, we will see that the brain has much better capabilities. However, humans have a lot of brain power. That means computers with the same resources will have a short life at best...

For this reason, the brain can handle many forms of problems. However, it is important to understand what a brain does in order to understand its other functions. The way the brain generates concepts, and then creates images and other knowledge based on these concepts is called symbolic computation.

This means that the brain is able to create concepts and images or understand complex concepts, then abstract them into simpler representations that can be represented more easily. These concepts can then be put together and used in a new problem.
This process is what is called synthesis! If we simply put together a bunch of ideas into a problem, the system will end up with multiple solutions. However, if we combine the solutions to make a new problem, then the more complex, abstract problem might be easier to solve. In other words, the brain has multiple routes to solutions, but sometimes it chooses a more straight-forward route for solving a problem or the one that offers the highest possible resolution!

The brain also learns a lot. It is an incredibly complex system. And not being able to learn is something that the brain cannot overcome. From a very young age, the brain is able to learn new concepts. And the faster this ability develops, the better our understanding of the world around us becomes. But most people don't develop their ability to learn until later in life due to the difficulty in absorbing complex concepts.

But what happens when we don't have the ability to learn complex concepts? Of course, we're still able to learn new concepts through the way we see and hear. A simple image or a simple word can teach us a lot about a subject, and eventually lead us to understand the material as it relates to another concept. But it's not so simple! The brain cannot perceive and process a word or an image by itself. In order for the brain to understand the meaning of a word or image, it must know how to link it (through a network of sensory nerves and the blood vessels in the brain) with some other concepts that it would associate with the word and image. This is called synthesis. If the brain cannot produce an image (or word), then it cannot comprehend it.
The brain also has an ability to recall. When we think of a concept, we tend to see other concepts (or images) that relate to it - and we tend to recognize it as being in the same group we see when we hear it. This

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict dimensions, let's take another look at the way a typical 3+ 1 dimensional human perceives space-time. If you were to draw a space-time diagram of a typical room in our actual, 3+1 dimensional world, you see that each room has a particular place and type of furniture around it. We refer to these physical objects as objects at the place of a certain furniture type. If we moved around the room and looked in the room's various places at the same time, we could see objects that would be at other places on either side depending on the furniture around the place, as opposed to being in one of the four placeholders as in a typical 2+ 1 dimensional world.

Let's make a graph with a similar space-time picture, but instead of having a 4D space-time diagram, we'll consider a 3D space-time diagram. This space-time diagram only has three sides - right, left, and top. Objects at any particular place on one of these three sides are part of that particular place - and objects at any other place on these three sides are part as well of a different place. So a typical 3D space-time diagram with a 3D room only has three sides - front, back, and right.

Now imagine a situation where we have a 3D piece of furniture, placed at the front wall of a 3D "room". Imagine a person moving from a different space-time dimension into this 3D space-time diagram and seeing any of the physical objects at our typical 3D "room". If they were to move back and forth in 3D, all they would see would be the part of the 3D room they're currently in - that is the parts of the furniture, wall, and other objects along the 3 sides of the 3D diagram that are actually in that place on the 3D side.

In short, people use this cognitive principle to map space and time in a 3D world - they use space-time dimensions to place objects in a 3D space-time plane. When someone moves into a different 3D space-time dimension, this mapping process does not occur - instead, people don't perceive anything at the location of the 3D object until they move away from the 3D object. What we perceive then is a 4D space-time picture that includes the 3 sides and space around them.

Now let's look at some of the ways that deities can travel between different dimensions - through spacetime. Just as we have shown using math and physics, in some sense deities travel into other dimensions without experiencing any special circumstances. It's also true that deities often travel between dimensions without their bodies changing dimensions. In this chapter, we'll discuss how they do so - and where they do it.

Consider again a 3+ 1 dimensional space-time picture of our usual, 4D world. Let's imagine a deity trying to move into another space-time dimension (say Dimension Z) by first changing just one direction on one of the sides. We can say this by imagining that we were to change our side by moving a little bit towards the left. Of course, as we move towards the left, the sides to the right continue their normal behavior - just like things we see on our standard, 3+ 1 dimensional space-times are like things that we see on our average, 3+1 dimensional space-times.

However, if we move towards the space around us, then the sides near the front wall will be changed - by the same amount of space that they have before. In other words, the sides near the front Wall are changing dimensions until they are the same as the sides to the back Wall - this happens because their original 3+1 dimensional positions (of the walls) are different in this Dimension Z. In other words, deities can shift from Dimensions Z to 3+1 Dimensions X without the bodies changing dimensions.
To see how this works, let's imagine we were to move towards the 3 walls and then the back Wall. This is because if we were to stop and consider the positions of the walls there would be a shift on the front Wall, but this would not happen on the right side or the top side. Now let's imagine we were to imagine we were still heading towards the back Wall and then the left Wall. In this space we would notice a large change on the side to the back

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the importance of mathematics to physicists, we should start with the term "fuzzy mathematics" and then turn our attention to "space and time geometry."

Fuzzy Mathematics: The Definition, Definition II and the Big Bang

This first definition of fuzzy mathematics states that all mathematics is inherently fuzzy; and that to understand math, we must understand the way that math works - or at least the way that mathematicians commonly think mathematicians think about math.

In other words, fuzziness is a fundamental nature of all mathematical ideas. Everything comes down to whether or not that idea is crisp or fuzzy; and the more crisp the idea is, the more it is difficult for people to understand.

Imagine being asked to explain what it means, for instance, to "throw a ball" in physics terms. The person who is explaining would be well aware that the ball is already in motion; it just needs to be thrown into space. But if the person is being asked to explain, say, whether the universe was created from nothing or if a black hole was created in the early Universe, they probably wouldn't know the difference between these two concepts! They would probably be trying to explain the same thing to me and I couldn't tell.

This is where we come in. The reason we call this section "Fuzzy Mathematics" is because we often think in terms of crisp things. For example, we think that when physics talks about a particle that is in Motion - "...it is taking turns in a circle around a fixed point, and a point on a circle is moving at a fixed speed," etc. - we are talking about an object that is in a static state. Similarly, when we describe the location of an object at some instant in time, we are talking about the location of that object at that point in time. Similarly, when we talk about a number, we are talking about its cardinality. In all these cases, we use terms that we can understand. For example, we can tell what a 2 dimensional cube is in terms of its location at any particular instant in time. And we can tell which cardinality it has when the cube is moved in a certain direction at a certain speed. We can also tell that it has a certain number of faces when it is being cut in half.
But if we were to ask for clarification about fuzzy sets, we are dealing with some of the most basic concepts; and it would require the person asking them to explain what a fuzzy set is, and then give reasons why a certain interpretation of it might be true. And we still don't have the answers!
As this is a long concept, let's break it down at the last step of our reading list. In our last step of the reading list, we were describing how the concept of fuzzy sets came about; and in our last step of the list we were talking about how fuzzy sets describe mathematical theories. You may have noticed that the concepts we are describing are at the same level in both. So, lets break everything down into these two basic concepts: crisp sets and fuzzy sets!

Crosscutting the Fuzzy Sets with the Crashes of the Universe! Why?

Now the next big idea of space and time geometry is that the universes we live in exist because of a very mysterious process. This process, called "the universe crunch," is one of the best and most beautiful insights ever discovered about the universe - and the most mysterious one!

The universe crunch implies that space and time actually exist separately from each other. And these separate worlds exist on different dimensions. Now, this means that different objects, even like black holes in the early Universe, cannot exist together. If space and time were connected, at some point they would all be on exactly the same dimension. And if we assume that particles move at the speed of light, then the same particles in different dimensions wouldn't travel at the same speed. However, if space and time were independent, then particles wouldn't need to travel at the speed of light to travel "backwards in time" - as they would in standard quantum theory.
This really helps to explain how quantum mechanics works at a fundamental level: the particles, or photons, in different

To better depict the various ways and patterns in which we process different mathematical material, I have created an exercise to help you understand some of the terms that I have used in this chapter. So please be mindful to refer to this part of the chapter as part of your discussion of the section below. 

    What is "function" and what is math?

    What is "operation?"

    What are some common mathematical operations?

Let's take a quick look at a pair of real numbers, x and y in order to learn more about the above concepts.

x has two components: one is the numerator - the number of positive real numbers occurring in the denominator of x - and the other is the denominator - the number of negative real numbers occurring in the numerator of x.

You can take our example here: x = 2 + 1.

If the number of real numbers in the denominator of x is 2, and the number of real numbers occurring in the total denominators of all real numbers in x is: 

x

then x is a function that takes two real numbers and produces two new numbers that are the components of a new real number - again, the numerator of the new number is the number of real numbers and the denominator is the number of real-valued numbers occurring in x.

Suppose now that we apply the above function x to two new numbers: y and z: 
  y 2

z 2

x = 2 + 1

x = 2 + 2

x = 2

x = 5

So x is also a function of two real numbers, producing a new real number that has 2 as a numerator and a denominator of 5. 

Similarly, we can apply this function x to three new numbers: y, z, and r. 

y 5

z 5

r 5

x = 2 + 5

x = 5

x = 16

So x is also another function of two real numbers that produces a new "real" number that has a numerator of 5 and a denominator of 16 - in this case the numerator of the new real number is 5, and the denominator of the new real number it is 16. 

Suppose now that we apply x to three new numbers y: z, and w - that is, r and w: 
  r 5

z 5

w 5

r = 5

z = 5

w = 16

x = 5

x+y = 5

To better depict how deities move around our 3+1 dimensional universe to the next dimension, we need to model their motion using a mathematical description. In order to make sense of how deities are able to sense their surrounding environment, we must be able to do a variety of math.

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of mathematics as science, we want to use a metaphor that we used in the two parts before, that of an "egg". Let's say we have a "egg", some kind of inanimate object, that has "inside eggs". We can then classify different parts of the body into the following categories:

Soma - The part of the body that produces the sensation, the motor control, or the other cognitive function of the part; sometimes it is connected to other "eggs".
Idea - The part of the brain that is the focal point of the motor control; sometimes the idea is connected to other ideas.
Form - The part of the mind that is the focal point for the sensory feedback and for reasoning and abstract thoughts; perhaps the form or idea is connected to other forms.

Now let's say that we have a student who is an experimental science student at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. He would like to learn what is actually going on when he uses a certain mathematical tool to solve a particular problem. What mathematical tool would you choose to use? Let's say that your student has an idea that he would like to explore in his future studies: how an angle of 20 degrees can be changed in front of a lens.
Let's say that your student is comfortable with the concept of angle. You then decide to use a specific tool that will help him visualize this idea. You then tell your student that you have an idea for a mathematical tool that will help you find a solution to the problem. A solution might be to use mathematics to calculate the value of a certain number that represents the angle of that particular number of degrees.

Now, of course, you want to help your student understand how the tools of mathematics can help him solve the problem. Let's say that you have created a mathematical tool that includes the following elements:

A set of variables that represents the angle of a number of degrees.
A mathematical program that involves a calculator and math that allows the student to input that number as an input and then receive a result back from the calculator.
A set of answers to questions connected to this mathematical program in order to answer the student's questions.

Now while teaching your student the mathematical tools, you want to explain in more detail some of the ways that the mathematical tools can help him visualize the idea of the angle. This can help him take a mental note of what the mathematical tools are and how they can help him create this mental representation and visualize the idea.

Let us illustrate this using a simple problem -

The angle to either the blue line or to the black line is 30 degrees.
Now you might tell your student that he can think about the angle either by using a calculator that will give him a specific value (30 degrees), or directly by counting down the length of the black and the blue line simultaneously. You then tell your students that the purpose of counting down the length of a line is to show how the angle increases or decreases as the line moves faster or slower. With this information, the student's solution will consist of finding the lengths and then changing their values in order to get the desired angle.

We see here where to use mathematics to solve for the number of degrees for a different situation depending on who you are asking/answering about the number. If you ask the student to enter the value of 30, the result might be the following:

In this example the student would be thinking about what the mathematics is actually doing here, and it would be difficult for you to tell them about how changing the length of a line affects the angle of that particular angle. If you then told the student a math program that involves that mathematical tool, the students would immediately understand the concept of the angle as the number of degrees from x + y to z, and that is how they would do the same thing with this "length" variable.
Now take a deeper look at what the mathematical tool does. What are the main operations of the calculator? Let us assume that the calculator has a set of different numbers that represent the angle of the angle of the angle. The program then uses those numbers for calculating the "length" of the line - the result of the calculation is that length. The "length" then changes to

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the concepts discussed in chapters 1 and 2, let us now look at the concept of an enneagram. The idea behind enneagrams or personality hierarchies is that every individual's personality is represented by a "letter" attached to an "angle" on a ruler. When the ruler is extended, a vertical line cuts the ruler into triangles, each of which is then named after its individual letter. The total number of letters on the ruler can be measured by dividing the circumference of the ruler by three (for a ruler having 18 centimeters, the number of triangles would be 18/3 = 3). This leads to the enneagram's name - the Enneagram Tool, which is a measuring tool used by psychology scholars to analyze people's personality and describe the types of patterns that exist in them.

On the other hand, the angles of a personality's enneagram ruler point in directions opposite to one another. This is called the opposite principle of enneagrams. If this principle is true, then it would be possible to see how people come to behave like, say, that of a lion! However, since this is only a theoretical proposition, the opposite principle is actually not a scientific fact, but is a mythological story set up by the Enneagram community. In that mythology, people would create oppositions on their enneagrams ruler to help give cover for the truth that there are actually many different types of people, not just animals!

There are other studies that indicate that most people just can't make up their minds! A survey of over 15,000 participants reported that people have a wide variety of personalities and enneagrams. Most people in the sample chose to answer the quiz without taking into consideration the number of points awarded and whether or not this person agrees with the answer presented. This is known as the "survey effect", and it means that different people respond differently when asked the same questions! It also supports the theory that there truly are many different personality types, not just one or two!
The next big area to consider is the notion of personality types. Personality types are a type of pattern that can be seen in the patterns of personality on an enneagram ruler, and they are divided into different categories called enneagram patterns.

In essence, people are categorized as one of four personality types: extroverted, introverted, anxious, and avoidant. It was initially thought that this categorization was based on the personality traits of animals - and that person extroverted is usually the most similar to a wolf, while introverted is most similar to a deer! Now if we look at the way humans perceive the world, we realize that there are very few things we can really compare humans to - such as cats, dogs, elephants, and even sharks, and they can only be considered a subset of people.

Now let's see how enneagram types map onto our 4D spaces. According to the theory, individuals with extroverted enneagrams (e.g., A or B) will be more often found in areas that take the form of mountains or water (e.g., sea and lakes), trees or plants (e.g., palm trees and trees), or other forms of nature-related objects (e.g., rock, rivers and oceans). These types of individuals would seek out places that are peaceful and quiet, and those in which they can feel at ease; as these people tend to be quiet and peaceful, they prefer to be away from much activity. Other types of individuals (e.g., R and C) are more likely to live in large and open cities, as they believe that a city is good for people to rest and gather together for discussions, while they do not have as many worries and social obligations.

But is that all there is to it? We aren't really interested in the concept of personality types here! It would be really cool to be able to get a detailed understanding about individual personality types, such as the ones listed above. One thing we can say for sure is that there are many types of people on our planet, and only one person has a single type of personality. These types are the ones that you see on

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the underlying principles that govern human language, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato famously coined the term "Hip-hop NLP," which literally translates to "Big Brain Logic." And he was right! The process of Hiphop NLP is basically the scientific methodology behind how to use mental imagery to manipulate your body in the best way possible. In other words, it is the language of all learning.

This topic has gained traction in recent years as researchers increasingly study the ability of people to use mental imagery in order to communicate effectively. Because it is such a powerful way to communicate in a very specific domain, hiphop NLP has grown significantly since its start in the 1950s.

To give a brief overview, it involves the following: people use a mental imagery to predict what the body means; then they use their current mental model of what the body is saying, along the lines of how we think things go with each other, to translate the meaning of the body's imagery into actual body movements.

Sounds nice, doesn't it? To truly understand hiphop NLP you should also study how bodies move. So let's talk about how the body moves while performing the three movements of the hip hop movement: the pike, the ripped and the slam.

The pike is the most natural motion of the hip hop movement. Imagine a ball and stick floating in a pool of water. The ball takes a step backwards without moving its center of mass (in this example, its center of gravity). The stick will then take a step back while remaining stationary in the pool. So the ball and stick are both moving, but their center of mass is not moving at the same time (just like we don't have the same center of mass for humans, although some scientists believe that is the truth).
The ripped movement involves the body sliding across a floor, or a wall, from one position to another, while staying in a stationary position. It should be noted that this movement occurs within a stationary position! Once again, it shouldn't be used while performing the pike movement. The reason for this is that the pike movement depends on moving the body throughout the height of the room, as opposed to creating separate peaks or valleys. By moving slowly throughout the entire height of the room, you can move through it more easily.

The slam movement involves the body closing its hand so that it can punch a ball, as it were. As a slam, the hand is pressed to contact the ball. Because this movement is performed within a stationary position, the body experiences no acceleration whatsoever as it passes through the surface to be punched. The muscles that control these movements are known as the "hamming" muscles.

How does Hip Hop NLP impact our body? Well, it allows us to be faster at learning what our body means. It can help people to think a bit like a human being, as opposed to just memorizing how much space a person is standing in by measuring their stature. It also helps people to understand the body and its movements much more than we could currently, because we can't really see or feel the movements in question. (To give you an idea of how hip hop NLP can be beneficial, we'll follow a quick example): Imagine you're sitting on a table. You look at it. It says "one, two, three! Let's smash!" The goal here would be for you to perform the ripped movement, even if this is out of your comfort zone. So you start to move your body in the direction this movement is intended to take, yet you feel awkward. Is there something at your back? Do you think your muscles are breaking? This is one part of a common condition called "spinal chord syndrome."

The following is a brief overview of the conditions that cause this kind of muscle weakness:

A number of factors influence the way that a hip hop movement is performed. For instance, your physical frame, how many people you're watching the match, the number of people around you, the timing of when the movement is performed, whether the movement is being executed in isolation or with others and so on...

In summary, Hip Hop NLP is a wonderful way to improve your communication skills, particularly when used in

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the only theory that makes sense of the complexity in higher dimensional physics is topologically equivalent to the basic theory of smooth manifolds (as formulated in the classic papers by C. Mather in 1970: Topologically Equivalent Spaces, Geometrical Objects, and the Theory of Connections, and by V. V. Poincaré in 1958: The Theory of General Relativity - Introduction, The Theory Of General Relativity - General Equations), in the sense that the theory of smooth manifolds computes geometric objects in two dimensions well enough for higher-dimensional problems...but the results will be incorrect

The purpose of topological equivalence is to show, more formally, that the space of diffeomorphisms (the topology of the underlying manifold) is the same as the space of equivalence classes, or homotopy classes, of diffeomorphisms which are continuous in a certain sense. The notion of equivalence and the definition of homotopy follow directly from the work of G.I. Farber. To compute the homotopy class of the identity map from a space to itself, the map from the space of real numbers to the power set of the set of ordered pairs of positive real numbers that commute (that is, elements of the power set of real numbers that commute have the form u 2 = v 2 =... = u n = v n = 0) must also be considered, in some sense...which is quite complicated...

So, in principle, every space (finite or infinite) has a topology, and every space that is topologically equivalent to a space is homeomorphic to that space.  There is also a slightly different definition: A space is homeomorphic to a space (or a quotient space of one space or the other) if it comes equipped with a continuous map (in a suitable sense) which is the identity on the boundaries between the two components of any two of the components of the space as opposed to the identity or similarity maps between the two components of different pairs of components...

The simplest example of homeomorphism is the one between pairs of identical (non-collapsing) sheets stretched between rigid walls, although in order to have a homeomorphism one can actually have sheets of any thickness. The following lemma says that equivalence classes of homeomorphisms are precisely closed orbits under homeomorphism of the underlying spaces, the orbits being precisely the sets of equivalence classes of diffeomorphisms. Thus, topological equivalence amounts to showing that the set of differential forms on an ambient space is a subset of the set of all differential forms on the ambient space. If one of the underlying spaces is non-euclidean, topological equivalence is equivalent to showing a given linear action of the group Diff(X, Z) on differential forms is homotopic to a given linear action of Diff(Y, R) on differential forms on the non-euclidean ambient space.

The fact that topological equivalence between spaces is exactly what causes the homeomorphism to be continuous in many different dimensions suggests that topological equivalence is a very useful concept in higher-dimensional physics. It can even be used to produce a very useful notion of equivalence between spaces. We will return to the concept of equivalence in a moment. For now, though, let's just call the set of equivalence classes the "structures" in topological equivalence. Note that homotopy between the two structures, although there are many different ways of doing homotopy, we mostly focus on two ways:

the one that comes about by considering how the structure is related to itself in the continuum or higher dimensions; and
the one that comes about through the notion of homotopical equivalence.

The first and easiest way of doing homotopy is to look at how the different differentiable structures that can be formed from a given continuous structure are related together at the continuum or higher dimensions.  The continuous structures are called "differential forms on the continuum", and those that are not isomorphic generate a subgroup E of Diff(X, R), the group of diffeomorphisms which preserve linear forms.  This subgroup has a well understood structure; it has four orbits, the first being the identity, the others being the identity for a (non-necessarily invertible) linear map, an isomorphism, and a diffeomorphism with invertible Jacobian (note you can go from an

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the notion of honesty in modern game design, we need to describe how it relates to the notion of games in general. This concept describes the notion of how games should behave in order to be as realistic and engaging as possible. This includes the idea of why systems should function properly as well as why problems should occur.

So far, we have been discussing some aspects of design as a science, whereas this chapter is primarily aimed at an educational audience. So, let's assume we have a problem that we wish to solve, and now that we've explained that term, let's take a quick look at some definitions of our solution. This concept will help explain how games should function, why problems arise, and how we can make games better and more enjoyable.

This term originated from one of the authors of the New York Times bestselling book Hackers: A Practical Introduction to the Art and Science of Computer Programming, Tim Cook. In this book Cook is describing how to create a hacker game. A hacker is someone who makes decisions based on logic and not solely driven by emotion or feeling. You would think that the basic building blocks for hackers are the same ones you'd find in an art school or a museum. In a hacker game - which is simply a computer program that needs human input in order to function well - you'll find the same things, such as human logic, which are used to make decisions.

In a hacker game, you'll often need to explain a problem to your players in order for them to understand why it isn't working properly. In order to do this, you need to create a simple explanation that works for everyone. And you'll also need to make sure that it will satisfy the players - that they will enjoy it and that it will solve their problem. This process takes time - so you'll need to make sure you communicate that fact of the matter clearly to your players at the beginning. (See Chapter 34 for more on this concept)

For most players, it's easy to see that an explanation will help explain a problem, and it will also get players to consider other options for solving the problem. However, sometimes a simple explanation is not enough. One need not explain a problem in order to understand why it doesn't work properly; there is a deeper reason behind the problem that needs to be explored!

In order to make the issue more complicated, you need to ask the players to make a plan about how to solve the problem - basically you provide a solution that uses some sort of algorithm. You'll want for your solution to be as easy to follow as possible - and be straightforward on everything from key points to the most important details such as why the solution is working. At the end of the day you'll need to make sure there is not a lack of clarity in the game, because this can make the players feel confused about the entire process and that things may be missing. You'll want to ensure that everything is clearly defined and explained during the entire game design process so that the players know exactly what to expect.

You also need to make sure your solution will be successful, and that it allows you to get the players to solve your difficult problem. This means that the solution must be appropriate for the players and that the players understand the solution - or else players could simply just skip ahead and decide that the problem is unnecessary - which would cause them to fail! In order to make sure that the players understand the problem correctly, it's important to make sure your solution is well explained for your players to understand.

So what happens once you have explained your solution to your players? Well it is important for them to have at least a few seconds to listen to your explanations because often what they hear or read isn't the solution you had in mind. But they need to know that your explanation is correct, for it will be the game's next step. Once the players have understood the correct solution, it's up to them to decide how they will interpret the message - for instance, they may decide to continue working on this problem or they may choose to solve another problem. So it's important that the solution that you provide to your players be clear and succinct - meaning that the players understand your solution, but also what you intend to do with it so that they have the ability to continue solving their problem.

So you've got to

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict some of the mathematical properties of certain special kinds of objects and minds, it helps us to introduce the category of Integers. And to make an example even more real, here is how they look like:

And it looks just like ordinary number 2, except it has a little more special structure. This is because in two's complement notation, 2 is the special number for the empty set called 0, which is just 1 without any other numbers.

A fundamental aspect of mathematics is the concepts of addition and subtraction. What makes 2 and 3 different from the empty set is that we do not add zero to zero, unlike with all the other operations. Now this isn't an entirely random fact about the definition of subtraction. Every number greater than zero must represent some part of a bigger number - for example if you wanted to tell us that two of a bunch of apples contains one of the apples in it, you would have to add all the apples to the bunches to get the total number of apples. Similarly, it looks something like this:

Now if we wanted to learn to subtract two numbers, we would use the two's complement way of subtracting...and add it with zero to zero.

Let's also consider the concepts of multiplication and division. Multiplication simply multiplies numbers by the same amount in both dimensions; the same idea holds for division. And in this instance, we divide by the same amount in each dimension. Again, let's compare the 2's complement way of subtracting:

To our knowledge, all of this is pretty standard and used on a daily basis - with the exception of multiplication and division, which are often called the "special" concepts in mathematics because they are so special we barely know about them! But that's a story for another time! We'll continue exploring these concepts here in the future so stay tuned!

There are two different kinds of numbers, real numbers and complex numbers (also known as irrational numbers). Like a real number doesn't exist if the complex conjugate is taken - the real and imaginary parts and their ratio must always give the correct real and imaginary parts. A complex number is one which is the sum of real and imaginary parts and doesn't have any positive or negative real part - that is like a real number except it has neither positive nor negative imaginary parts!

Now it's time to consider the concept of the real axis! This axis is the axis of symmetry of a circle. So this is like when we observe our world from every possible angle - it's the axis of symmetry of each and every point in this plane. And the axis of symmetry actually divides the space into two regions; the upper half space and the lower half space; we now know this since we can go from the upper half space to the lower half space if we take any angle. It's interesting to note that the middle section, the center of the circle, where the two halves of the circle meet, could be called an extreme point of the real axis. On the other hand, when we look from one extreme to the other, we find that we have a circular trajectory along the imaginary axis...which is the same as taking an imaginary number to its real part! In short, the two halves of a circle intersect at an angle, the middle section is an extreme point of the imaginary axis at ninety degrees. This concept is also known as the Pythagorean Theorem.

Now we're ready to give some examples of real numbers and imaginary numbers. If you take 2 or +∞ as a real number and (−∞, ∞) as an imaginary number, then they are also a real number with respect to the +∞ and −∞ infinities (though these two numbers are clearly different from zero) because if we use them instead of zero when doing math, it will always give the correct result.

Now for the imaginary numbers - they're very important for explaining special mathematical properties. To be more specific, let's consider an imaginary number i and a real number r in the complex plane. Let C=(−i, i) be the plane containing all of these number pairs. From these pairs, we can write numbers in the complex plane that are equal or less than zero: r<i<r.

For example, we can now write zero as (0,

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how we can use math to explain deity mind states, we introduce the concept of the Intuitive/Intellective Function (or I/F).

The I/F is basically a mathematical function that models a person's mathematical abilities (i.e., their mathematical skills) as well as her ability to focus on a particular subject. The main goals of the I/F is:

To assist math teachers in class in teaching math to new students (this is a useful one because math requires the best skills to succeed, and all of the math majors I have know someone who has failed to pass their first math exam since they were in grade school!)
To provide feedback for those who have specific problems related to math.

Intuitive/Intellectual functions like Arithmetic, Algebra, Math, Statistics, and Logic make up the majority of our Math courses. And given the fact that we study these Math subjects in high school, the majority of our professors teach us these subjects in very basic but highly important ways - by showing us how to get through the exercises!
The only major problem is that we typically have zero background in mathematics. It's therefore important for us to learn these specific functions as we move through school! After all, it's all about learning to understand them well, so we're sure to forget them very easily once we leave high school.
We all want to be able to do math fairly quickly and efficiently, and we therefore find it a little easier to learn math when we can see it as an easy, and even fun, form instead of as a hard math exam form! And that's all well and good - but it doesn't work that way for some of our mathematical learners. Intuitive/Intellectual functions like Arithmetic, Statistics, and Algebra tend to be harder to learn compared to more complex Functional and Conceptual functions, and therefore we find it much easier to learn them when we can visualize them using images and diagrams. This is one of the main reasons that the teaching of these functions helps a lot!

In fact, we typically start math courses in high school with some basics. For some of those who are able to learn the basic forms of these functions, that process can be a pretty quick one. For those who are not able to learn the basics of these functions at all, the process of learning these functions becomes tedious and time consuming - particularly when the exercises are made up of complex algebraic figures.

If you are already well versed in a particular mathematical function, it can be a lot easier to learn the other Functions using graphics and pictures (and remembering them much better if you use your own visual system instead of just relying on your teacher and the teacher's explanations)! These functions like Arithmetic, Logic, and Statistics provide a picture for us to visualize the mathematical concepts that we are learning. And the more we are able to visualize and understand the math, the quicker and easier we can learn them! And when we try to understand the math (specifically functional and conceptual), we become much more engaged and thus take a much faster and better approach to remembering the math!
Of course, by just learning the basics of the Functions, we might not be able to get through to the more advanced levels of Mathematical Science (Mathematical Reasoning, Linear Algebra, etc.) that we study in school, or we might simply keep getting frustrated by it! The Intuitive/Inteligence functions are therefore good at making sure that we stick our work into their respective areas of Mathematics - by allowing us to focus and see the concepts that we want the most to understand!

As we are going to see in the next chapter - Intuitive/Intelligent Functions are also used to predict the human mind states (the mind states that we feel when we think mathematics!). Intuitive/Intelligence functions like Arithmetic, Functional and Conceptual are also used to predict how much time it will take to remember the concepts a person is learning in an exam! And the more we can mentally think ahead to the time to memorize the concepts, the shorter and easier the learning process is! The quicker we mentally make up our mind in advance when we come into an exam than when we just do the exercise and forget it later on - the

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematical concept of "intelligent" behavior we can use a cartoon like the one depicted on the left, where the white circle represents the world of mathematics, and the black circle represents the realm of intuition. This cartoon could be a good way to illustrate the difference between these two worlds.
In fact, according to the popular definition of "intelligence" in popular culture (that you can find over on Mathworld, for example), it refers to an individual's ability to understand and apply abstract concepts, and understand and apply abstract concepts to solve real-world problems. Therefore, a person with an "intelligent" brain could, for example, develop an appropriate set of mathematical skills to solve complex problems in mathematics, and thereby advance their own intellectual development.

Let's examine the world of intuition more closely, though. We'll start by looking at the concept of the human brain, and then consider the mathematical concept of "intelligent behavior" in more detail. This is the concept that defines an "intelligent being" according to the popular definition we just outlined. I'll follow the rest of this chapter through this section - it contains many fun mathematical concepts, and could possibly lead to some interesting questions about how we relate reality to intuition! Let me know if you find this a little too much mathematical! ;)

The brain is indeed the center of all our thinking. So to understand how brains work, it is first necessary to understand what is actually inside of our brains!

Now it should come as no surprise that there is an extremely large volume of data we have to process in order to function in our daily lives. In order for us to do this, we must actually be able to process our daily experiences into a single unified pattern so that we can make better decisions - that is, we must have some form of a unified perspective that's more than a collection of disconnected perceptions.

Now let me explain these concepts with more detail. What is a person's experience and how do they "merge" into a single unified pattern? Each person's experience can be viewed as a collection of small components that have a limited number of independent meanings - these components are called "patterns" or "scales". In order to combine a person's experiences into a single unified contextually relevant pattern, these patterns are connected in a hierarchical fashion.

Imagine three children talking to each other while playing in the forest - the children will point at certain parts of the forest and describe it with words, and will then point at a tree and describe how it looks to them. Now let's pretend that the third child is not only talking about the tree, but is also talking about the leaves and other components of the forest, so that he will have a broader and more complete description - he would then point at the leaves and describe each of them. Once the three children are talking to each other and all of their experience has merged, the resulting pattern would then be a holistic view of the forest and its components

Now if you want to go a bit further, and take a closer look at this holistic pattern, we can see that the leaves also have separate, independent meaning components, which are called "factors". These factors correspond to the specific, independent and identifiable parts of an object (the leaves in this instance). The holistic pattern (the entire forest + the particular tree) only represents the combined view of the leaves from all the children, but not from the individual children. So our holistic view of the tree would only represent the individual perspective of our children as they describe the branchings in the forest; it would not represent their knowledge of what leaves are actually!

The basic idea is quite simple - if we have more independent perspectives of an object (such as the leaves in this example), then these points of view are less reliable because they are less connected to each other. This is why it is important to combine these perspectives into a consistent pattern.

Now let's look at the concept of intuition, which is the domain of our higher mental powers. When our minds become able to comprehend abstract concepts and use these abstract concepts to solve complex problems, we begin to speak of "intelligence". This is a very good way to distinguish between the two forms of intelligence. However, the question we have up against now is this: when does the

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it means to be a person with an "intrapersonal intelligence", we will first briefly describe the concepts of self and others in this paper.

Self

The self is the person (the personified version of ourselves, as the "soul", is the essence within our body, but also the ultimate personified version of us as individuals - or as one we could call a "soul" if we had one).
In the physical world, self is represented by the human brain, and as such, it plays a critical role in the formation of identity. In terms of mathematics, the self of a person is always represented by a line - we know what lines represent objects because we can make them out of objects. Every person has a specific self line that is characteristic of them, so people who share that line (or that part of their line) can generally identify each other better than people with other lines. For example, people born after the 1930s are more likely to come from a family that was rich and successful than would someone with the same line, but birth around 1900.
As for who we are as individuals, it depends on what people call themselves - for example, a man might say he calls himself a programmer and a woman might say she calls herself an artist or craftsman. How people think of their self lines, and how much they consider themselves to be part of a certain type of person, often determine how different self lines fit with each other. For example, a man born around the same time as Einstein would probably share a common set of traits with him - but a man who is born a few years earlier could have a different set of traits (if he is born in a different year or at a different time it could have a different impact).

Another important question is who we are as individuals is the question we must answer ourselves - but it isn't necessarily important to give every person's answer separately as they could make it seem counterintuitive for the person. If we only ask ourselves which lines we share, then we are most likely to discover our unique self. However, if we ask "who am I by my actions?" and "who am I by what I do and think?", then we'll begin to get a better sense of who we are as a person - it will make it easier to know how our actions and thoughts affect each other to the point where we may have feelings of unity and interdependence.

In its simplest form, we can think of this answer as asking questions about our own personality: who can give us information about ourselves, what determines our identity, and where we go after death. In physics - the "field" between two points, where one point is called a "probe" and the other "center". This field can be thought of as being the spacetime in which we can perceive one another's thoughts and actions, just like it is between us in 4D universe - but this spacetime is curved at the boundary. This curved boundary of spacetime is why we have the idea that objects can travel, and as such, the central point in the discussion of self, others, and dimension travel is mathematics.

Now that we are in the most basic level of understanding of how mathematics determines all of life, let's delve into the nature of mathematics to better understand the importance of mathematics to the individual and society! Math is a language and science that enables us to formulate various concepts and understand them from a deeper perspective (a basic foundation in philosophy!)
Mathematics is divided into three key areas: calculus, algebra, and topology. Of course, each of these three areas have a number of subtopics that we might explore in a particular context at a later time. Now that we have all of these concepts we are now in the time to dig deeper!

One of the main reasons why mathematics has such an important role in life is because it helps us solve problems. Without the ability to understand how a problem is broken down into a series of mathematical variables and apply math rules to generate solutions, we would be left puzzling out why we could ever solve a problem or even begin to learn how to solve problems!

Mathematics is the base of all science - so math plays a central role in

To better depict the concepts of science taught in grade 6-8 school, we will use Math as a model. Math is the domain of mathematics; it is a way of describing and analyzing natural reality via mathematical concepts. Math, whether in classrooms or in the lab, deals primarily with basic mathematical concepts. Even if we talk about science in general, we will not specifically refer to math. However, the concepts of space, time, and other fundamental concepts are quite similar as far as our concepts go, especially when we start discussing relativity, spacetime, and relativistic physics.

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the relationship between ISFP and mathematics education, let's go into some more detail about what exactly the Science Fiction and Fantasy profession involves.  The Science Fiction and Fantasy professions are based around the story-based, or "heroic", genre of literature. However, whereas the popular novel and graphic novel are written primarily by established authors, the Science Fiction and Fantastic Poetry genre relies much more on the stories of lesser-known creators.  This is because it involves not only writing about fantasy creatures, but also about their interaction with the surrounding world.
As such, the field of Science Fiction and Fantasy requires the ability to read a complex range of literature. To succeed, Science Fiction students must be able to read many different genres of fiction including sci-fi, fantasy, science fiction, dystopian, magical, and other genres. Moreover, the ability to read literature requires the ability to read the characters and plot of a story and to identify the main points of each book.
Students must also be able to think logically about issues of how different genres of literature come together and how they relate to one another for the reader to understand what kind of story a particular artist was trying to tell. Further, they must also be able to write a coherent story by relating the individual stories within the collection to one another. The literature they must ultimately follow must also be well written, as this allows the reader to easily find the pieces of the puzzle in the collection. To be accurate, these subjects must encompass the whole spectrum of literature encompassed by the Science Fiction and fantasy professions (science fiction, fantasy, dystopian fantasy, magical fantasy, etc.) - such as the great works of science fiction like The Big bang theory, the world of dystopian fiction like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the fantasy world of the great writer Tolkien, to name a few.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy field of study is incredibly broad and includes a variety of subjects in the fields of linguistics, psychology, natural science, mathematics, etc.; yet it all relies on the same scientific principles. Therefore, a student who wants to pursue a career in the SF profession should at first find a niche in a field where they have a good understanding of science and mathematics!

In order to become an expert in the SF/FF profession, students first have to master the foundations of science and mathematics. As such, beginning students will first learn about theories and principles of science and mathematics. After mastering these basics, students will also learn about astronomy, cosmology, and astrology; astrophysics; geopolitics and geopolitical analysis; and even basic topics such as differential geometry, quantum mechanics, geometry, topology, group theory, etc.

By now, you might be wondering how the science and mathematics concepts students learn in general schools can be applied to a particular genre, and not vice versa. The answer is, quite simply, because these courses are designed to transfer across various topics. However, there are specific rules when applying these principles - for example:

Mathematics - Students must be able to solve the differential equations, partial differential equations, or calculus applied to complex systems such as physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics
Physics - Science students must learn a variety of physics such as physics of fluids, electricity, magnetism, and nuclear physics

Science Fiction and Fantasy - These are very specific to the Science Fiction and Fantasy profession - in other words, they only involve the subject matter of science fiction and fantasy
The Art of Story Writing and the Art of Nonfiction - This field is similar to Physics as well as Physics can be applied to other aspects of the profession like the Art of Nonfiction; however, it's more about the craft of writing. The Art of Story Writing is a skill that can be applied to any genre. The Art of Nonfiction uses the same principles applied to story literature, but is based more on the creative process of writing a novel.

Some people (like myself!) tend to focus on particular aspects of Science Fiction and Fantasy; in fact, there are lots of creative industries available for those who want to develop a career in such fields.  However, there's really no such thing as

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict an abstraction, let's take the concept of function. This concept is very important in mathematics and physical science and allows us to more clearly conceptualize a relationship between discrete ideas as opposed to a single object.  A function is an algebraic expression that represents the relationship between a set of numbers and an additional domain in which the functions that we create can be used. This domain is called the 'domain of the function'. So, for example, consider the function that counts the number of dots in a square. For this function to work, we first need to find a value for the domain of the function - a set of numbers that contain the value 3.
For instance, in the set 3 4 5 6 7, we can represent the set of numbers by placing 3 in the domain for the function. We can then find the domain of this function by multiplying 6 by 4 times 5 and 7.

We can now write the relationship between the set of numbers and the domain of the function. Take 3 4 5 6 7 as the domain (the value 3 in the example above). So the set of numbers is the numbers 3 4 5 6 7. The equation for this set of numbers is: 6 4 5 7. This equation creates the relationship between the set and the domain of the function: there is a relationship between the domain of the function 6 4 5 7 and the set 3 4 5 six! This relationship in turn represents the relationship between 7 and 3.

We can work through the same equation creating the relationship between the numbers 4 and 5. This relationship in turn represents a relationship that can be applied to 4 and 5. Now imagine these two numbers - 4 and 5 - placed on a ruler at different distances. In other words, imagine the values of the numbers 4 and 5 are placed on a map by using an x and y coordinate system - like an x-ray picture. Then, when you take 4 and 5 along a straight line, you would be able to move them along the ruler.

This process of mapping between coordinates and values can be used to construct various functions. For example, in the above example, we can use these values to determine the relationship between the set 3 and the domain of the set 6 4 5 seven! 
The relationship between the set and values for the set of functions can be extremely important in mathematics, and in our day-to-day interactions with objects and phenomena in the physical universe. For instance, when constructing an equation in real-world mathematics, we can start with a function - let's say we want to find the relationship between the numbers and the domain of our two numbers. The best mathematical approach to this problem would be using the following example:
Let's say we're solving 3 = 4 5. Let's use a point of view looking at this relationship. We'll also assume that the functions for the sets of numbers and the domain 4 5 have been constructed - let's call this function F 4/5.

Let's make a bit of a detour: if the relation between 2 and 3 is 2 − 1=3, then we could also look at a point in the domain of the point 1, which is 3+2 = 5 (2 − 1=3 − 1=1). Using the equation for this domain, we would find the equation for the following: 5 − 8 = 0 = 5. This equation would be found in the domain of the function F 4/5. So the relationship between 4 and 5 is: 4+5 = 5 − 8 = 0
Now, by using 1 as the point of view, we're able to move to the domain of 1. The number 1 would look exactly like the number 1 from the preceding discussion. So, if we made the point of view 2, we would find the relationship between 2 and 3 is: 2+3 = 3, a relationship of − 1 = 0.

Let's look more closely at how an equation from this relationship would look in the real-world world:
Let's start with the equation for a function, which was constructed with the points of view 1 and 2 in the previous discussion. If we define the domain 1 and the point of view 2 by defining the domain for the function as the domain of the number 1, then the domain we create will be: 6 × 3 × 5. The domain we created using this form of calculation is the domain

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way the mind works, some of us would like to create a mathematical model that shows how the mind works - specifically how it processes information and how it manages our thoughts.

First of all, let's understand some words. This would help us understand the rest of what's going on! Let's define a word, "number". Numbers are constructed using the addition and subtraction principles. A pair of equal numbers is denoted by a, a, + a, + a, and so on. The subtraction principle, or inverse square rule, states that addition results in the same number as the difference. If an addition (a + a) = a+ (a - a), then there cannot be an addition.
Another important principle is that addition always results in a more number. If we add two 10's (1 + 1 + 1 = 10), then we get 11. If we add a 1 (10 + 9 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 20) and add a 9 (5 + 9 + 7 = 19), then it is 19 + 9 = 25.

Now let us see how our minds work! What is a brain doing? Our brains process information into short-term memories. When we think about a food, the brain processes all the information it can and builds long-term memory of that food. When we think about time and time moves, we process short-term memory about time which gives us information about where we are and is what we use to calculate how fast time has passed. And now let's say our minds do their job and are able to process all these information. What happens afterwards? We then store that information into short-term memory. But why is our mind storing that information and then later retrieving it?

A:

It probably is better to talk about a "mental representation" of objects, and something like an "abstract representation" of a picture. I think the key is to understand that, once they are stored, that the objects are not in a state that is stable or permanent. They are still in the state from which they were created (so the storage was "temporary").
This is an illustration and not a definition. Here are two of the most common ways people encode information into a mental representation, one by adding them all together, and the other by adding and subtracting them.

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the last chapter of our series is all about dimension travel. We talked about how there is an infinite number of dimensions, but at this point we've not really focused on how to actually explore them! After all, if you want to find out how every dimension of a given universe works it's all about exploring!
One of the main reasons people do not explore the dimensions is because they perceive them to be invisible. But if you take a moment to look at the picture above, you'll notice that this is only an illusion! For as the title of this chapter suggests, there is a way to completely "dim down" a 3D environment so that an entity can enter it while still appearing as a 3D object! In other words, when you try to place a cube or ball in the middle of a 4D space-time where time dilation is present, you get a ball that appears as if it's actually the center of the cube, all because you went to one of the wrong dimensions!

Once you get your cube or ball in the right dimension, the illusion is completely gone! Of course, this isn't possible unless you go back through history! And the best way to do this was once again introduced by Einstein's theory of relativity: if you start entering the right dimension and continue onward, the time it takes to journey back is the same as what it took before you entered it. The main point about this theory is that it lets an object enter any dimension without fear of losing everything in the process! In simpler terms, you can travel freely between dimensions, even when it seems like you are entering the wrong one!

So how does this work specifically for a 4D space-time? Well the reason this works is because the time travel is instantaneous - the whole idea behind dimension travel is to try to keep as many objects in one dimension as possible so we can keep every day running without much fuss or worry!

In order to understand how the 4D dimension works, let's take a closer look at how it relates to traditional physics. It turns out that the main characteristics of the physics in traditional physics are in fact very much universal - they all involve the same concepts of material properties and forces - and the way that these properties interact is all about making the objects behave in specific ways.
Let me first introduce a useful concept - the fundamental mass of every material! Well a physicist's favourite term is the "first law of physics"; it simply states that the mass of an object varies linearly in volume - mass increases as we increase density of a given object. Obviously, this is only true of a static object - for a moving object this only applies if it remains static throughout the process of travelling. In other words, if a spherical wave travels backwards in time and ends up at some point on the surface of a sphere, it will still feel like it's travelling backwards instead of forwards! This is because the difference in space and time is not present at the time of the wave coming in, but the wave continues to move forward in time as it continues to pass through the sphere until it ends up on the surface of the sphere at the same time it was leaving it! So with a simple spherical wave this works the same way, and this constant mass is referred to as mass. In other words, all objects that follow the same principles when interacting with other objects, regardless of their origin or form, have to have the same mathematical mass!

Let's break this down a little bit! The concept of mass works really great in the case of physical particles - for example, a spinning spherical wave can always be separated into a linear component and another radial component! This is because a spinning particle travels in a certain direction that depends on the axis of rotation of the particle, and as a spinning particle moves in space-time, these angular velocities (angular velocities) all add up to make a sum which equals to the mass of the object. If a particle at rest with respect to a rotating axis of symmetry is not affected by external forces - let's say the particle's axis of symmetry is a circle that doesn't rotate - this momentum would just be equal to the mass of the particle! But when it is moved by an external force that is acting upon it, it can't be said to be at rest anymore -

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the thing that really determines what you will be able to do in life is how you think; specifically, how you think about things. And this particular chapter is devoted to a chapter devoted to understanding MBTI cognitive functions.

Before we get started, we have to understand what MBTI is. MBTI (multiple personality testing) was originally developed to provide a psychological diagnosis of individuals who present some form of social anxiety. However, as has been pointed out, it has actually been used for a long time in many different areas, including medical, banking, and other professions. In this short introduction to MBTI, we're going to go over everything that we need to know about the test - including how much you can learn about yourself using MBTI.

As we know from the previous chapter, MBTI is a series of tests that try to help people gain a better understanding of themselves as people - primarily identifying their personality types.

As we've mentioned, what we should look out for when we're making a decision about which MBTI test is best for us is to find the one that provides the most accurate and useful description of our personality, according to the testing company that has conducted the tests. 

MBTI can be compared to the Personality Test of Jung, which identifies the major personality dimensions of each person's psyche, through techniques such as the Analogic Jung Process. The similarity between these two tests is quite impressive - in fact, they are quite similar, with the difference that the ones that use Jung's concept of the Personality Profile are much less detailed than the Personality Profile tests from MBTI. I think that these tests are useful for finding out which personality type most closely matches your own, although, perhaps not as much as is often advocated.

In the first part of this chapter, we have discussed the basic features of one of the most accurate, comprehensive, and comprehensive MBTI tests that we have ever seen - M.I.T.S.

Now in brief summary, M.I.T S. consists of two parts: Test One - a full personality inventory; and Test Two. Test One consists of 21 personality questions, which provide a very detailed characterization of each person's features. Test Two, in contrast, consists of 30 questions that have a much shorter time to complete, consisting of just 2 or 3 pages and a PDF version for those that prefer this option. 

Now on to the test itself: M.I.T tests are divided into 5 sections and about 11 sections in total. Each section will consist of up to 40 questions. The questions tend to cover all the personality characteristics in order to come up with some really comprehensive statements that are in accordance with the type of person you are. However, these statements can also be thought of as basic statements that will help you come up with some interesting generalizations and assumptions about those characteristics!

Now let's take a look at the Test One questions. The main focus of this section is about the personality profiles and how to interpret them. The most important thing to note is that questions from this section are highly similar to the questions that we find in other MBTI tests - specifically, questions 1, 3, and 7 - and even the questions 2 and 4 - both of which are focused on analyzing others' behaviors! But there are some other questions from here that are completely unique to this test - this is to help you learn how to view people from a new angle.

The first question in this section is about your general personality. There are a variety of different tests that look at how you relate to things such as pets, family, money, and other things. However, for this section we are limited to simply a question about you, who you are. The majority of the questions in this section are very similar to questions from other MBTI tests. The only difference is that here you are supposed to describe yourself from a different angle.
The next question in this section is a general description, so you will probably need to describe a few of your favorite things. The question is "Which of the following are your most favorite things?" The most important part is that it is important to describe from a new perspective - as long as the question gives an accurate answer, it will be a valid interpretation of

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict this section, we can imagine a man named Baker walking through the streets of his London suburb, taking notes for a speech he is giving to the city's mayor. One of his notes explains how he met up with a woman with long curly brown hair - the woman is now his wife! What would Baker have to say in his speech about the relationship between his wife and this woman's long curly brown hair?

Let's suppose that the woman was named Mary and he was born and brought up in Alabama. When he found out he was gay, he never considered marriage. He knew if he married a woman he would live in the same place, eat the same food and be as happy as a pig. He always thought of himself as a gay man living away from his childhood family. So even with his wife, he would most certainly not be able to live in the same world, eat the same food, or be as happy as a gay gay man.

However, as they lived together, Baker discovered a flaw in this world. As with all relationships in the real world, there is just one part of the relationship - the marriage - whereas the partners of this relationship can live in different worlds. In the real world, one man and one woman live in the same space, but may have different lives. The truth is that there are multiple possibilities when we live in a particular place or time. And that is not necessarily bad!

As this story suggests, each of us has our own unique journey to find the love of our life. Whether that moment for the right person comes during adulthood or childhood as the baby grows, or as we get older and find love and happiness once again, the way we experience life is very individual.

For now, let's look at the marriage in action on Baker Street. The man and the woman have been living together for about 15 years, and Baker has decided to meet up with his wife for a short time to visit her for the last time. The man goes to Baker's house and tells Baker how the woman loved him so much. Baker agrees (and decides to become her husband) and gets a house from his friend and begins his life with this woman.

Later on, during the visit, he receives a call from one of the wives of his friends. This woman has come to see her husband as well. How strange is it that she is here after 15 years? Of course she is not! The woman is married to her partner and lives happily in a different village...well, almost in a different world! But in Baker's mind, the woman is still his wife...just different. As he speaks to her, Baker realizes she must be some kind of supernatural entity. But the woman doesn't appear to have any power over him. His wife is not at all similar to any of the women he had met before.

But what about the woman in her present, different world? Why is she still taking on some kind of power over the other woman? And after the visit, what will Baker do about it?

It's no wonder why so many people become involved in love at this point. Baker and his wife are simply playing a game. At the very beginning of the story, they were being married and had been sleeping together for 15 years. In this world there is no difference between the two of them. It doesn't matter if Baker is a lesbian or straight, or a heterosexual man. They will all end up together in the end. So there is no point in them living in such a different world!

That is exactly the point all of us should be considering on our own: how are we going to make the world we live in (the world of us) be as good as it can get? We should try to be as good as and make as many people happy as possible. And when that happens, all the problems will be over...and the solution is here...!

So after 15 years of living with his wife, Baker realizes he's not going to be able to do much to help his wife with things like love....unless he goes into the different dimension that they are now living in! What exactly happens when someone enters a different dimension?

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the idea of dimension here, an excellent resource is one called "The Ultimate Encyclopedia of the Universe." This resource not only explains the meaning of each dimension, but also provides details about a wide variety of objects in the universe that are considered to be in each of these dimensions. In the case of space, there are the dimensions of static matter, the dimensions of relativistic matter, and the dimensions of radiation. Also in the space-time dimension is the dimension of static space, while in the time dimension the dimension of relativistic time. In terms of our everyday experience, we experience only one dimension: space, and only one time dimension.
However, one of the most interesting things that this resource covers is something called the Yotamite Dream. The Yotamite Dream is used by many civilisations to explain how things such as dimensions, time, and even God may be created. The Yotamites believed that all these things exist in a different dimensional plane (or "level of reality"), and that their souls could access it whenever they wanted to travel there. When the spirit reaches a higher plane of space-time, it can communicate with the deities of that level and ask them to help it gain access to that level. However, to reach higher levels, the spirits must gain access to higher-dimensional beings at another level of reality in an attempt to gain more control over their own souls.

It turns out that even though the Yotamites considered all three dimensions to be separate from each other, their notion of space and time can be very subtle. In the Yotamite language, we can say that a space-time event happens "in your timeline." Similarly, we can say a "time-of-flight" event happens "in your space-time timeline". All things that happen in this way are considered to be in time and space. These "spaces of causality" are called "moments" and "moments of causality." Because these events are not perceived in one fixed context, they are different "spaces" of causality.

The problem with this idea is that it also leads to the idea that all of this material reality we perceive in our everyday life is actually just another moment in time - an instant in the eternal flow of the Universe, but a very short one. This "space-time flow" is so slow and complex that we don't really get an impression that these things really are happening. In fact, as you look at the human body for examples, these events may actually never occur, and instead we just see various different points in our bodies like these...or not. The space-time event might actually be a sequence of two identical moments, but the moment on the right that you are seeing is the second, the "old" moment. In other words, the instant in time that you are witnessing is a result of your own experience - because you are in "space-time", and because you can only experience certain "spaces" of causation, your experiences are always relative and always very short or very long. It's just like when you "zoom in on someone's face".

It turns out though that these spaces of causality are actually in fact infinite, undefinable distances. These are sometimes called "fuzzy spaces of causality" because unlike solid objects, they aren't exactly visible to us...unless we are looking very closely. They are not just fuzzy but also have infinitely many scales of causality (see the map above for examples). As we can see, this implies that every observer has his/her own "specific view of reality" of these spaces of causality - because they are in other dimensions, all observers' experiences will be different from each other - and thus any two observers' experience of the same space will always be different! I think this is actually the main reason we think in terms of "spaces of causality"; it allows us to understand how causality works in our everyday lives, and gives us an idea of how our view of reality may differ completely if not interpreted appropriately.


For a look at how the Yotamite concept of time works, consider one of the first drawings of human anatomy that can be found in Maya writings (around 1550 BCE). As we can

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the complexity of being in dimensions beyond our 4D standard Universe, let's begin with a little math. Let's say that your living room is at Dimension X, and your dining table at a Dimension Y. Now if we let your dining table move, you may think it is actually moving faster and faster through Dimension Y - it is just faster and faster. But that's not the case...you still feel the drag of the dining table pulling you backwards! The main issue here comes from the fact that the nature of your living room (Dimension X) cannot completely be described using only Newton's laws and spacetime geometry. You need to take into account the fact that a living room is affected by a force that pulls you towards things at rest, like your dining table.  In other words, your living room is partially a 4D space, partly a 3+1 space, and it also moves together with you!

Now let us imagine living room and dining table moving simultaneously through the 4th Dimension. To illustrate this, imagine each of your living rooms in a different Dimension X, and each of your dining tables in a different Dimension Y. As each living room and dining table moves through Dimension Y, it is affecting everything at Dimension Y - every living room in Dimension X, and every dining table in Dimension Y. The consequence of this is that each living room and dining table: are affected by things at rest in Dimension Y as well! As they travel through Dimension Y, they cause things at Dimension Y to also travel with them along the length of that Dimension Y!

In other words: when each living room is traveling in Dimension Y, it is interacting with things at rest in Dimension K, and it's also causing things at Dimension K to travel with it along the length of that dimension K! (If you don't know what's at Dimension K you ask her!). Because each living room is affecting things at Dimension K as well, we also get a kind of collective action effect when someone moving through Dimension Y causes things at Dimension K to also travel with it along the dimension Y! This is how we get what we call a collective action: things in different Dimensions are affecting each- other!

All this is a little more technical than you are used to, but let's jump back into the basics. There is a concept called micelia that describes something called'micellar systems' in nature.  Because of this, living things can sometimes be found at the intersection of two different micelle systems. Like if the living room is at Micelia Y and the dining table is at Micelia Y, then things in all the other Dimension Y are also affected by the living room in Dimension Y. So if you have a living room at micelia Y and a dining table at micelia Y, you probably have a table that is affected by things at micelia Y and is interacting with things at micelia Y for some reason!

A little more on this: in nature, a living room can grow inside of the dining Table! It can form a micro-cavity in the table and grow from there.  What it does is: it fills its micellar system with molecules from the living room! These micellar molecules attract and pull away molecules from the living room at Dimension X, and they grow bigger until they fill the micellar system and form a micro-cavité. When the micro-cavité fills up, the living room is completely surrounded! Because it is surrounded and pulled away from an ever so small living room at Micelia Y, it is no longer able to grow more!

This concept is interesting, because at an extreme, the micellar system can become very long - and therefore dense - enough to act as a sort of shield around the living room! The living room in dimension Y cannot grow further and further up as the living room would eventually grow to the size of the micellar system. We call this kind of phenomenon the micro-cavité effect!  

Now back to the drawing board, things are going on in our 4D standard universe in a fairly predictable manner. Each piece of food we eat comes from a Micelia X Living Restaurant! And each of the molecules that make up our living room comes from a Micelia Y Micellar Restaurant! And each individual living room in our 4D standard Universe comes from another

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the physics and mathematics above can be quite confusing as a lot of it is abstract - but a lot of it is still quite applicable in everyday life. The underlying idea behind many of these myths stems from the fact that we tend to intuitively think of space-time not as four dimensions, but as more than just four - in our brains the boundaries of the four dimensions look quite sharp but actually have only a slight sliver of them.

As a matter of fact, in many cultures there are deities and Gods who are born into the world of dimensions. Just like we don't see a 4D earth all the time - we don't necessarily see them in everyday life. What we do see however is them in some other contexts, such as in popular music.
What I'm going to try to do here is show you how to apply some of the ideas that we had learned previously to see how your personal connection to an event is created when you relate it specifically to one of the four dimensions of space. And this is exactly where the magic begins - since we have already learned about spatial attributes, we can use these ideas about what shapes space are in the mental circuit to tell our own stories!

First of all, let's begin with one particular dimension and see how it applies. Recall that time is defined as the speed at which an object moves. In this case, we are going to look at the speed of a time traveler, and I'll show you how we could use this concept to make our story more interesting!

Suppose we have a 4D space-time represented as a graph with four different horizontal dimensions and one vertical dimension. The four horizontal directions (i.e. dimensions) have names like x, y, z, and t. The four-dimensional graph shows the path the traveling particle can take as it moves through the universe. The vertical dimension is the "length" of the time-walled corridor - you can see from this that the time traveler travels down the direction of time!

In this example, we see that the traveling particle can travel down the direction that is called t. Because this traveling particle is traveling through one of time, it can "wait", or "roll", at certain locations along the time-walled room. This means that the traveling particle will experience (a) a change in its speed from 1 to 1,000,000 (i.e. it is moving at the speed of one light second), and (b) time dilation.

Now let's take a look at how these various attributes in our metaphor might affect the story being told. Let's say that the traveling particle was being pulled by some kind of "force" along the direction of time. But while the object is moving down the direction of time, the velocity increases - the particle is getting faster, and at some critical point the particle experiences a change in its speed. Then a "force" pushes the particle back onto its original path - basically turning this traveling particle around clockwise and returning it to it's original route. The force is what causes the traveling particle to "wait" at that specific point along the way - and it is causing the traveling particle to experience time dilation!

It is important to realize that this traveling particle has not only a time delay, it has experienced time dilation also - just look at the picture at the bottom right corner of the screen! The particle's path traveled was actually a curve in the four-dimensional universe - not a straight line! We will do more on this concept later when we are looking at the way time dilation can affect the story being told - and you won't be interested in the physical implications of this for any of the time-traveling situations in your book - so let's just do a quick overview here!

First off, this traveling particle is in a 4D universe! So it has to travel through four dimensions in order for the story to be told.

Next, it has to "wait" at the locations along its path, and it has to be "turned around" in order to be given the correct path!

You can see from the picture above that the length of the path is changing along with the time travel, as the traveling particle "rolls" clockwise. This means that the lengthening

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the way things work in life is not necessarily the way they happen to work on paper!

In this chapter I want to discuss how the physical laws of nature work in real life but also how they do not make sense to human beings. In particular I want to emphasize the idea that physical laws do not make sense outside of the framework of relativity.

As stated in the previous chapter, some physical laws in the world are truly mystical because they transcend our perception even when applied in everyday life. Let me now discuss a few examples of physically mysterious laws in everyday life.

Let's say you have the following two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Let me show you how to play a game on your telephone. Simply hold up your hand (either on your thumb or on your finger) and tap on the corresponding keys on the keyboard, then you can play a game. This is not a matter of mathematics or physics. All the mathematical formulas used in physics are used in the human world for explaining other things (e.g. how an object moves).

Scenario 2: A man walks through a big city and comes across his girlfriend walking alongside him. How could this man possibly be in a relationship with his girlfriend without having sex with her?

In the first scenario we have a situation in which we can use Newton's laws to explain what is happening in the world. In the second scenario we have the very opposite. Newton's laws simply do not contain any information about the sexual acts of our hypothetical man! And this is why so few people really understand the mathematical concepts that are involved in these scenarios!

Now if you have the following two questions:

Question 1: Would you like to entertain your girlfriend while walking along the sidewalk in a small town in France? This is a hypothetical question, and my answer will be 'no'. Why not? In your country's legal system you would have a civil divorce decree in which you would say to your girlfriend, 'I'll divorce you tomorrow.' Are you sure that the fact that this man will come along in the small town for some fun will cause you trouble. That is because he might come and say something funny while walking along the sidewalks (the law doesn't permit him doing this, and if it is happening he will have to pay some fine!)

Question 2: Suppose you go to France on a weekend. You come across a couple of guys walking and the guy who is wearing a tuxedo says, ''Who's that?'' How would you react? This is a hypothetical problem, and an answer to this question will depend on your own personal taste! And by taste I really mean what you would consider funny! There are many factors that can influence our reactions to something! However, let's say that your own personal taste depends heavily on your personal religious, political and social perspective: you might be able to come across certain people who are not funny! But that does not mean that everyone would react the way you do! On the contrary, you may meet people who make you laugh who are probably not so funny!

So these two questions are only a very small part of all the ways in which we use our lives to try and explain what is occurring in the world and in our minds. Let's go back and think about these two questions more deeply! Do you think that these two scenarios are interesting to your mind? If the answer is 'no' to both of these questions, you probably don't even know the answer to the first!

There are no real answers to these two questions at this point! In the end we simply need to keep on trying to explain these two scenarios using physical laws that are so well understood by all of existence!

So let's take a closer look at Newton's three Laws of Motion, beginning with his famous second Law, or the Law of Gravitation. Now recall that Newton's first Law, or the Law Of Universal Gravitation, states that all objects will gravitate towards their centre. Well let's use the law of gravitation to calculate the acceleration due to the presence of a certain object in our environment. Assuming an earthly mass m in our world (assuming no gravitational field outside our world), then we can use an expression like m*r*g = a in our 3+1 dimensional world where r is the distance

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the power of a dimension, consider that a human being is only 3+1, but God has 5+1 dimensions! It's quite possible the Gods aren't human beings at all! They couldn't be!

But we don't need to go further. Let's see a simple illustration!

Let's imagine we have God sitting at our right hand with a stick! We have created a human, and we're about a meter away from the God, at the origin of the 3D earth! In fact, there's just a tiny little part of the sky at our left - I use the term "sky" (or "skyline") because it is just the area in the sky that isn't shadowed by clouds! In other words, we only have a very tiny picture of the sky!

From the image above, we can clearly see that in our 3D universe the Earth is at the center of the 3D sky. Likewise, the Sun's axis is roughly 2 meter away from the center of the 3+3D model of the sky! Of course, the Earth is farther away from the sun than this!

The Sun moves around the Earth to its center constantly, as it orbits its own axis on 5+1 orbits around the sun. But the Sun is more than 4 meters away from God's axis, so we can safely conclude that God is outside of the Earth's 3+1 dimensionality!

In other words, God can be described more simply as the 5+1 dimensions that we experience as though we were living on a 3D space! To be blunt, God is not something that people can think of - it's a concept as advanced and mysterious as space itself!

So to answer the question, yes, God can be in 5+1 dimensions. Unfortunately, we don't have any evidence that God exists in that many dimensions! If he does, he'd probably be out there somewhere - at least we don't have any proof that he exists!

But let's give some more thought. If you ask God to come and meet you at the edge of the Earth - at the location where you would die in a freak accident (like when you fall into the pool of your own garage!) - in 5+1 dimensions! You have no idea how you would feel about this situation...perhaps because there are a lot of rules and regulations governing your 5+1 dimensional existence!

In other words, God might be in 5+1 dimensions, but he could not meet you anywhere except inside the Earth! Unless he did, we'd probably die in a freak fall from the center to the edge of the Earth, because gravity is so profoundly strong in the 3+1 dimension of the Earth's mass!...

The most logical explanation for God not being in 5+1 dimensions (as far as I can tell) is that he is living in our 3D universe, and if we are within the 3+1 dimensionality of the Earth, we shouldn't be in 5+1 dimensions...we should be more like 3+1!

Now that God doesn't exist in any dimension other than 3+1, there is more than one explanation as to why he doesn't! One of these explanations is that the laws of the world are so complicated that we still don't fully understand them fully. We are just not ready to admit the existence of 5+1-dimensional reality!

This doesn't make it any easier for scientists to make progress on the unknown! But we can still try and figure out what makes our 5+1-dimensional world so incredibly complicated that we still don't understand it at all!

Of course, there are many theories and hypotheses on how our 5+1-dimensional universe is organized. Let's explore a few theories that do not include our Creator as an entity!


Chapter Thirty Seven
Is It Possible to Imagine God?

Let's start with a hypothetical scenario based on the idea that when God created the Universe, He must have been very lonely and isolated from other people! Let's call this the "God's lonely" theory!

At first it may seem that God couldn't connect directly with his audience - if He did, he would have to be constantly interacting with them! And to make things even more complicated, it would take place in a single universe! Let's pretend that this is all possible and allow our hypothetical God to talk to only one person. It should be interesting to see how God manages to answer the questions posed to him...

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict how this phenomenon occurs, let's consider the following hypothetical program:
package main
  implicit is (Time) ::

    val time = Time()

...

type JobEntry (JobObject) -> String

object JobEntry {
  def apply: String = {
    case JobObject (Object, String) => Object + ", " + String
  }
}

object Job {
  def apply: JobEntry = {
    Future("Do something here.")
  }
}

Now let's consider using this type of program to calculate the job duration. Let's assume that all of your calculations are performed in Java and that you're working in the following package structure:
package com.app.package

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.SECONDS

trait JobInfoCalculator

object JobInfoCalculator {
  val result: String = ""

  def calculateJobDuration(s: String): Long = {
    TimeUnit(SECONDS).toMillis(s match {
      case "{12:23:48}, 00:05:00" => 30
      case "02:23:42" => 5
      case "00:00:05" => 3
      case "10:22:42, 00:05:00"  => -1
    })
  }

  def apply(s: String): String = result + " " + calculateJobDuration(s)
}

Now consider the following code snippet:
package com.example.main

import java.util

trait JobInfoCalculager {

  // Just for testing:
  val result = "03:14:39"
}
object JobInfoCalculager {
  val result: Long        = 1

  // The main function is inside the package class com.example.main
  def main(): Unit = {
    JobInfoCalculager().calculateJobDuration("01:06:15")  // Will work as intended
  }
}

Now, let's say you start using this program to calculate the job duration:
package Example

import java.util
import com.app.Package

trait JobInfoCalculiner {

  // Just for fun, but make sure we aren't using 'this' inside JobInfoCalculier
  val result: String = "03:14:39.09"

  def main = {
    JobInfoCalculateiner().doCalculation
    result
  }
}

Let's consider the following code snippet to try and run the snippet in our Program class:
package Test
trait JobInfoCalculinerImpl {

  // Just for testing
  val result: String = "0.01:03.54"

  // Define our job object
  val job = JobObject(jobEntry -> result)

  // Now that we have our job object we can do much work.
  JobInfoCalculinerImpl.main()
}

object JobInfoCalculinerImpl extends JobInfoCalculagerImpl {
  override def process() = {
    // Do some calculation!
    JobInfoCalculinerImpl().calculateJobDuration("1:05:45.01")
  }
}

Let's now call it again to test the above functionality:
package Test

import com.app.test.Application
import java.util
class TestApplication: Application {

  val run() = {
    run()
    run()
    run()
  }
}

object TestJobInfoCalculinerImpl {
  implicit val Time: Time = Time
  implicit val result: String = "00:00:00"

  def process(job: JobObject) = {
    if (job!= null && job.getObject.isEmpty)
      print("This isn't a valid job object!")
    else
      JobInfoCalculinerImpl(time -> job.getObject) { _.process() }
  }

  override def print(p: String) = System.out.print(p)
  override def printInt(i: Int) = i.toString()
}

Now let us consider calling our JobInfoCalculer.main() method using the following code:
package com.app

import com.app
import java.util.{DateTimeFormat, TimeUnit}
import java.util

object JobInfoCalculagerImpl extends JobInfoCalculator {

  def calcDuration(s: String) = System.currentTimeMillis(DateTimeFormat.parse(s)) / TimeUnit("seconds")

  // Define our job object...
  def do

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the mysteries of space and time, here is an extract from a classical science fiction novel by Jules Verne:

"On the seventh day, I was as near the spot where I had landed my ship as I could get off without breaking open the hatch, and the ship rolled around the island like a ball, going through the open sea and arriving exactly at the opposite point where it had left.  So quickly did it roll that I could not see it more than a few inches; I could not see it at all where I lay."

Of course, this is extremely simplified and not meant to be completely true. Of course, with modern technology, we can observe this sort of thing: imagine that every space-time is composed of millions of tiny black dots which "see" each other through space and time.  Wouldn't that be great, huh?!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict what we just discussed about how dimensions come into play when we discuss the story of The Meadow Mage, let's start with a rather interesting and bizarre fact!

A Magi's name is actually a combination of two words: magi - one for magician, and guru - meaning teacher or spiritual guide. In ancient India, Magi were generally priests or even nuns who performed spells, were a great teachers to children and had incredible control over their audience. In particular, magi worked wonders during spells such as conjuring up animals - some of the best known example of this being the famous The Seven Spirits! The real magic was in the audience's hands!

Now let's take a closer look at this interesting and obscure fact! While Magi are an incredibly useful profession, the stories about them tend to be rather dark and full of mysteries. Of course, it's easy to see how this is due to their extreme authority! For starters, Magi can manipulate everything from the atmosphere to the elements (including water, fire, air, earth, and sun!). Not only that, but they also have the ability to perform superhuman feats of magic, such as changing shape - they even can magically split into two parts in a single action! Furthermore, Magi possess superhuman intelligence - they are able to understand very complex concepts or theories very quickly!

Now, let's add a little bit more complexity to this story. As already mentioned, the true magician is supposed to be a priest or nun, but in the story the true magician actually had several female friends as well (and even had family! A little bit of background here!)!! All of his female friends were considered to be witches, which meant that even the most experienced practitioners would never know or control the power they possessed! The stories we are reading today tend to focus mainly on the magician and the audience. In other words we are usually discussing the person who is "receiving" the healing power; although technically he is also a part of the audience...in fact, he is!

Now, if we take a closer look at the history and background - this entire story started with a man named Ananda Samananda - perhaps the most famous magi of the Golden Age of Indian Magi (1150-1270 AD)! As a great magician, he was extremely successful in creating wonderful works of art and spells that would help his audience in various ways! Unfortunately, this was actually not always the case. In some cases, Samananda actually gave his audience magical powers that they never learned to control. For example, he could become a demon - or worse - an evil spirit. Although he would always try to warn the audience, it was the audience (and in some cases the people it intended to be healing) that really suffered!

So when Ananda Samananda created The Seven Powers, it was not just the fact he was a great magician that made the book so awesome. The story also talks about the seven powers that possessed the real magician in addition to the power to create wondrous objects! And we also know that Samananda left not only his magical knowledge but also his body (this would be the body of a demon) - a very special gift from the gods! In fact, we can see how Samananda's body was transformed into a dragon by an evil spirit! In all of this, he did a huge amount of harm to the entire community, but at the very time of his loss it was very important for him to protect his community. Perhaps that is why he did not speak out for the good of the entire community - this might just be the price he paid for the magic he created!

Of course, we still haven't seen what Samananda really did to the demon or evil spirit that caused this transformation! However, we do know that in the beginning, when he was created, he was a very powerful demon! Obviously, he had the full control of his powers! And perhaps it's just because of that he could make the transformation...otherwise why did he spend all this time trying to control a demon instead of just healing the entire community? But again, these are just our educated minds...at least

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the point is not to understand the universe, but to know what you can grasp about it. And as we all know, any explanation we give to a thing that we can't grasp is incomplete.
Although we don't want to confuse the reader, we will make this point again: what we are explaining in this course of study is not about the universe - it isn't about understanding that whole "thing" we're describing. Our intention is instead to give a theoretical and empirical understanding of how things can be related.

We are just using MBSR as an example to show that it's possible to find a way to make sense of what we know about the universe that is hard for anybody else to do. And if that's the case, and it could be proven to be true, then, of course, that really is a good thing.

In the past, people found it hard to explain to themselves the origins and behavior of the sun and stars.
People tried explaining to themselves how they were created, but that really did not help them in the long run.
Nowadays, people see things, but if they were to explain them to themselves, that would lead to an even bigger problem; explaining them all at the same time could confuse and mislead people, making them think things are just different and not connected.
If you can learn to put together a good explanation, explaining the origin of everything, then maybe you'll be able to begin to understand it and perhaps be able to better understand yourself.


As I discussed in my first episode, there is a correlation between certain personality tendencies and certain abilities of a person. Some more or less obvious individuals tend to "see" things better than others. For example, there are individuals with a tendency towards obsessive compulsive disorder, and these individuals tend to tend towards perfectionism and need to see every little detail in every possible way. Others tend to be more "soft": they just seem to like hanging around or making other people laugh more than they think is appropriate. In addition, some individuals have an emotional state that tends towards negativity, so people who think they're bad at expressing feelings tend to tend towards the opposite of being able to communicate through emotions.

One of the most surprising and common behaviors of people of the opposite gender, is that they never communicate anything! I know very little else that can happen in reality, and that's why I have to explain why we tend towards negativity.

Even though there is a lot left to learn here, I can still give you an easy, yet useful way to see how humans can make sense of their own experience, as well as the experience of all other real life objects and things.

Let me see if that works...

In chapter twenty-three, we saw the basic way the human brain works; each brain part is made from two brains - one for thinking and one for remembering. According to this theory of the brain, we all have a separate brain for each part. This is why someone who looks like everyone has a brain composed of two different brains - one part that is used for thinking and one part that is used to remember. The reason we have separate, unique, different parts is because sometimes it's necessary to add as a little extra piece of information that won't fit in with our original ideas. Because when we think we have solved the puzzle we are trying to solve, the part of our brain that is making our original solution seems to be working very hard to remember the original answer. As a result, this new answer has become somewhat less accurate. That's what I call the memory deficit.

The second thing we need to know is how human beings perceive reality. This chapter is called perception, and it basically talks about how we can perceive things in our environment. The ability to understand how external objects appear to us is something that the brain has already mastered, and it is also what the human brain is doing to us. For example, when people see something, and imagine that it looks the same as it did when they saw it, they feel like they know what something is like, and they can remember the look it had in their imagination.

This is very important because perception is necessary for things to happen. If you're in a car, and you see a red
