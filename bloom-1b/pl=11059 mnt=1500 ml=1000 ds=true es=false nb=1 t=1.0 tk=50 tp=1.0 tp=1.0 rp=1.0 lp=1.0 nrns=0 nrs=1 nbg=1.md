Yes, ultimately, the fact that Chaplin isn't actually Charlie Chaplin is something that I really shouldn't spoil! But in a way, that's all it is: there's no way to know for sure...and thats only by just watching Chaplin films! So lets keep this for another chapter, shall we? We have another of the many mysteries about Chaplin that haven't been explained yet...

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the story of God comes down to his "one true child" being lost! And as he travels the earth with his mother, he encounters many of the earth's worst religious men. This story is extremely well detailed in both Genesis and Exodus chapters, and of even more so in the Book of Mormon! The idea of a lost "God" is central to nearly all religions, which I found immensely fascinating! You can even see some of the Bible's biggest quotes taken from it...such as:

For God is one, and he is not divided;
He is the same yesterday, and now;
He is not a Spirit nor a Son, but one God, the Father of all, in whom we have eternal life;
for his name is great and glorious, unsearchable before God. [Revelation 5:8 (King James)]
For we have begotten him, he is of the Father;
that he is within us, and we are of him;
he is the same yesterday and now.
For God is one.

As we explore these verses in more detail - it is quite amazing to see how so many of God's greatest prophets, such as Moses, Elias, Daniel, and Elijah, all have described him as: the "One True Child" who is the source and source of all things. Of course, the more you ponder the story of God, the more complicated it becomes! In fact, there are even so many gods and their versions! Some even claim to be the only ones and others declare they are all a bunch of misguided beings who just make jokes with us!

So what does all this have to do with the Fourth Wall? Well, quite simply: these gods are all talking to one another! And in order for humans to understand their thoughts, they need a little help from another species - as they do in the film God, the Father of all! So from God, the Father of all come forth seven great angels named Adam, Eve, Adam and Eve, the first of God among them, but only man for one of them - we will be discussing this in this chapter!

It is in this section that we will also first introduce the concept of "dimension", and explain the key role it has played in the story of God. I'll discuss our main four dimensional concepts from here on out in detail!
Remember that in our main four dimensional space-time, the length and time scale are both equal - or in other words, no dimension is more or less important! In all four dimensions, the same things can happen or not happen, depending on the dimensionality chosen. In other words, every reality is limited by dimensions - which means that our ability to perceive and manipulate this reality is determined by the physical size of objects in our universe, and how quickly things move through time - rather than the speed of things!

As you begin to break down this simple concept again - we need to know what our world is actually doing within our three dimensions. Since we are aware of our three dimensions, we know that each dimension has its own unique and unique properties, and we are also able to create objects from three dimensions - just by changing the dimensions of the world around us. Now let's consider the example of the house we are inside - the house is made out of a box! To see how this would work, we need to take everything within the house. Imagine that a room's ceiling is a box. And each side is made out of a box. Let me take this box and think of the three sides and their shape. In other words, we are able to create out what the "walls" in the house are made out of. Now, we can begin to figure out how the walls are being made out of space. This concept is simply the most basic aspect of making objects from a box.

Now you should know how they are made! And now we also need to know how they can be melted! Again, here we have a simple idea to understand how a box can be melted using it! And I know this very basic idea is fundamental to creating a room, in other words, the base of reality.

Now, you have a simple concept of the world and how it's made from the three dimensions! Well you can now understand how to create a room! And you will know that in general, the space that is created within the universe is called "space itself". So the whole universe is made up entirely of the combination of three factors: space, substance and energy. So, our universe of physics is made up entirely of the combination of these three elements.

So in our universe, you are aware of the whole universe is made up of the combination of these three elements of substance and energy. So this is the whole universe is made up of four elements as the basis of the whole universe itself is composed of these four elements. So the whole universe is made of these four elements as the basis of the universe!
Which then is the universe is a whole is made up of four principles as the basis of each universe. 
Which is then this entire thing is made up of the five elements as the origin of that universe. And the whole universe is in itself is a composition of the five elements as the foundation of that being.
Thus the whole is a composition of the five elements as the basis of the whole being of the whole universe is actually that is the basis of the universe.
So the whole is made of the five elements as the basis of the whole universe.
So that is the basis of the whole is as the basic of the entire universe is
a and a and so is the essence of the whole universe that is the basis of is the entire whole.
So that is the foundation of the whole universe, and the whole is composed of the elements as the total of the whole.
And then, is the whole universe is a whole of all, the universe is composed of all, and the whole is composed of the three being as a the whole is composed of as the matter of the universe is a composed of the whole that is the part of the universe, the universe is as a component of the universe is a being, the universe is the of the universe is composed of all the elements of the world is made of is all created and the universe is universe.
and all is of what a whole is a universe is the all is a universe is all of in a total of the universe
is a universe.
and the universe is all of all all is universe. is the universe was created from The and the is in, universe is Universe is not is the universe is a universe, is. is universe, and is and is is a universe of. universe is so is, and then is is is ( because it is ( the. is a universe is, the universe is all the universe is and universe is is all is, since is is, and is is, and is and universe is is universe of. is is is is an is an is is the is universe is is is is the universe is the is the universe is = is and is the universe is is, so is is is is is exists is the = is is.

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the answer to this question is "Depends"! Because that depends on which people define "nipple" in a specific way!

For starters, there is no real biological definition of a "nipple"; it can be defined as any structure in an animal's nipples which allow for milk to be exuded from a female into the female's milk ducts...which is actually what gives me pause since I guess most of the time people describe nipples as "pupils".

As we've said before, the definition of "nipple" has changed over the years and can be found in many different places including Wikipedia, the American Heritage Dictionary and various others.  So let me try to explain the issue of confusion/belief among popular culture's viewpoints about nipples - specifically the term "pupil", and the idea that animals have "pupils"!

First of all, pupils are tiny eyelids attached to the middle of the front part of the head. These eyelids are what allows the eye to make it to the pupil - thus creating the concept of seeing and seeing through. And this concept can be seen much further back in time. The word pupils actually comes from Proto-Indo-European pa-, related to pāpa. Pāpa is a type of plant and is actually the root for the word "eye".  

However, pupils also seem to come from Greek πουπά. Pūpa is an Old English term referring to various things. According to The Oxford English Dictionary, it means "full moon; the point of a moon; or a sunspot". Interestingly enough, the word "pupil" has also been used in French, as well as many European languages.

So the pupils in nipples are actually called eyelids. Because they allow sight to be created by the eye, and because pupils are really tiny eyelids with little or no eyes attached, the word "nipple" also has some cultural connotations going back to ancient times and throughout history.

But is this really true? Well, let's see how popular cultural representations of nipples have become:

First, there isn't any biological evidence to confirm that there was ever any nipples in ancient humans. Just consider one of the most famous examples - the picture of the Venus Delicate nipple from one of Chasser's paintings - a portrait of Venus who seems rather much like an imaginary creation of art (it's actually an example of the Venus Venus Delicate) but still a true representation of ancient Venus.

Second, the concept of nipples dates back at least to Old Babylonian history - it was a common form of hair that was worn at a variety of societal occasions and practices in Mesopotamia, Egypt and throughout Eurasia. It took shape around the fourth century, when the Babylonian Sumerian society (also known as the Mesopotamian or Semitic) adopted a system of hair for identification. In fact we can really classify it as early hair because it was already quite long before the emergence of the Babylonian culture, but it definitely still has roots of being very early hair - much closer to our day-day hair! (Please check out this short video on a more advanced explanation of nipples and hair.))

Now, the first point we have is that some people have some idea of the shape of a penis. And based on this...that they believe it is an object of sex (or sex) that is being used to produce sperm. And based on this, they also believe that the concept of sex is being used to produce sperm as a means of reproduction.

Now here's the interesting part: If people believe that sperm is being produced for sex, then it should be using a form of energy. And based on this, there is a very strong idea that the act of sex and being used as a means of reproduction is actually an act of sexual being used to produce, or rather a form of sexual being used to produce sperm... (i.e. sexual being used to produce sperm) but not to be used to form sperm.

Why would such a thing be possible? Well from the Bible, we're told (Genesis 1:1) that God could not have created sperm - a process that is being used to reproduce, or to produce sperm - because it would not be possible to have created sperm. So this is a case of using something to form something else (or a result of something). Well, in the case of a creation of something, it is the product of something. So, therefore, what?
But, we will have seen the concept of an act of creating a thing...or a result of a process, because...there actually is a process. (Now, this was the product of some...some form of doing something.) And in the case of a product...there is the...a thing...
If the product of a process, will be created by it. So I will have seen the...
Now, we can have seen that the concept of an action - is a form of some of the things...which is, the thing of a function. And, then, if we take the concept of a thing and...
we can have the concept of a being...there is a thing being. And then, we can have the existence of a thing. and then, it is having the existence of a thing. And then, it would be the existence of a thing. And there is a thing -- it is actually being being - and then it is the object of the thing. And then, then, the thing exists.
Then, we will have the existence of a thing -- and then, we will have the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence - and then, we have the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of the existence of... -

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what the brain is like, maybe we'll use a cartoon. In the cartoon above, we'll use a small kid named Eren Arliss and his friend Finn as our main characters.

As you can see, Eren (black/red) has quite an interesting cognitive function. He is capable of understanding and interpreting complicated mathematical equations, but he is also quite fast in getting information from and memorizing information in a complicated way. In particular, he can quite quickly remember things we might have forgotten even when we have been up for hours!

Let's not talk too much about Eren's brain, but let's talk a little bit about how it functions! As we previously saw, the brain has two special areas - the cerebral cortex and the midbrain. The cerebral cortex is responsible for the higher levels of processing while the midbrain is mostly responsible for basic cognitive functions, such as memory and attention. As we will see soon enough, Eren is a wonderful cognitive warrior, capable of taking very simple mathematical concepts and manipulating them in such a complex way that even the basic human brain cannot comprehend them!

So how does Eren's brain work? Well it's actually quite simple - he learns mathematical concepts and manipulates them in a very complicated way: he looks for patterns or recurring patterns in objects and relationships, and then finds one or more simple patterns to combine them with each other to create very complex shapes and models that he can use to explain and understand all the mathematical terms used while creating these pieces of art.

It turns out that most mathematical concepts we don't need are just the simple forms of mathematical rules and ideas we know and use on a daily basis and that we take for granted - we only have to think about them so often and make them seem so easy to understand!

The mathematical concepts that we're seeing in this cartoon actually show an amazing level of abstraction - they are incredibly complex and contain many different mathematical equations. But what does this mean? Well in physics, we know lots of other concepts that aren't entirely mathematical at first glance (like gravity, magnetic fields, electric current, force etc). However, many of these concepts can actually be defined based on only a single mathematical notion; these are actually called 'primitives' in physics and are defined by very simple mathematical equations.

We know that physics cannot, and cannot, be explained with only the concepts and rules that we have taught students about during their course! We can use these simple mathematical concepts and rules to make a much more complicated picture of physics much more tangible - and much more understandable! For example, imagine a room with a ceiling that has no floor. On top of this ceiling, we have a flat floor with a ceiling as well! The room has two very similar levels with two very different types of objects inside! If each of these objects is placed at the same location on the same surface, then it will form a perfect triangle! In other words, these objects will form a perfect triangle with the three points connecting the points as vertices! These elements form a perfect triangle with three opposite points - the result of these three points creating a line at infinity - or space!

Now we can see several different ways to represent the space created when this object is put into a simple geometry! In addition to the triangle with the three points, there are also the triangles with the edges as vertices. Now there are these two basic shapes that we saw previously - the'rectangle and parallel'.

Now we need to start thinking about a basic construction for the world we are creating. It all starts with a box box! Remember the shape that looks like an elephant - we'll call it a 'box box'. The box box we used previously - a large rectangular box, will be the basic shape or basis for physics, as we will see in the next chapter! And here is the basic shape called the'sphere'. And the whole thing starts with a small cube and two other things - two small cubes. 
Now we need three cubes - the larger form - and all other elements needed to create a simple sphere. Here are three small cubes - the upper one - and the smallest one - and also these other two other objects.

Now we need to start the second level, a rectangle. These three things are exactly the same thing but their shapes are different - in case we want to make three larger rectangles. Now there are a lot of more smaller shapes - many more shapes.

Now, the same construction of the boxes is a lot of many more small cubes and so on, until we come to this, a very small solid, and now we're in the ultimate result. The universe, the four fundamental universe is the ultimate and ultimate form of reality!

The whole being, the universe or the universe of the entire being itself...
The universe is one of the ultimate forms of matter in one form of the beginning

But, this being is not the whole universe of all the forms of being!
Now, the whole world is comprised of the whole being/the entire universe of the whole matter of existence!... the whole universe is one of the universe-the part of the universe... and thus, one component of the universe is one of the whole universe. In this case, the whole universe is a of the entire universe is is a... and so is of the entire universe is one of the whole universe of the other one of the other

So, the whole universe is the form of the entire universe is the the... and the whole universe is the is the whole of the whole universe... which... is the whole universe is a part of the universe universe... - the universe is a part of... is the part of the everything, -- - and thus the universe is a of all together is a of the universe a

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this amazing phenomenon, we will concentrate on the so-called "ENFP" -- the Einstein's Neuro-Functional Personality Inventory - a questionnaire designed to explore people's ability as cognitive scientists, mathematicians, computer programmers, physicists, etc...The most common belief among most people is that people who belong to the ENFP are creative; they can solve problems, solve problems, solve problems...

But you don't have to believe in that. One of the most popular ideas about the ENFP, which has spawned loads of books and articles, is that they are the most intelligent people in existence! Yes, it can be true! However, this perception seems to be misguided at best. There are a number of reasons why people think so:

People claim that high ENFPs are extremely intelligent compared to people that don't belong to this personality type. Unfortunately, it's not the most scientific argument; it can be supported by empirical findings from other studies. As you probably know, most people don't know that being extremely intelligent can have an effect on the brain or how it functions. The only people that may be able to claim that they are intelligent or otherwise are those that have already passed through the ENFP and are able to clearly observe and recognize the change in the individuals behavior. In general, this appears to be a very small group of people in the world that have the highest IQ.

The belief that the ENFP are somehow unique is completely misguided. The ENFP is an umbrella term for a number of different characteristics that some people think are extremely intelligent or creative. There are also a wide range of other personality traits that can be categorized under this name. For example, people who claim to be extremely creative are often highly intelligent, but also possess cognitive abilities that allow them to understand and recognize change in human behavior.

However, this type of thinking is a great way to interpret many other seemingly random observations concerning some people. This phenomenon is called "swapping personality". As previously mentioned, some people claim to be ENFPs; however, their actual brain function doesn't necessarily match the one they claim to have. Moreover, scientists have also identified another personality trait that sometimes causes people to mistakenly associate the two abilities on the ENFP spectrum - the "Self-Degenerative Personality".

If you read The Invisible Man by Howard Chaynes, you would realize that the ENFP can literally change their behavior! In The Invisible Man, a young man enters a strange tunnel where he experiences physical and emotional changes. Unfortunately, due to the physical changes, he starts to believe that he can go back into his earlier life...while still being a human. Of course, the change is too extreme to be reversed - once the tunnels become even more dangerous, the man's personality suddenly changes as well -- so he becomes "evil"!...

In other words, if you find yourself within a tunnel and suddenly experience physical and emotional changes, you can literally change your personality to be a criminal. As you can see, this is a totally unreal scenario that is possible; it is something that you could imagine and it happens to happen to you! You just need to be an ordinary human being and it is possible for you to make a change or go back in time! If you're curious, check out this series on The Lost Ones.
Finally...the biggest question of all - the last big question we have to answer is: WHAT DID THESE EVPSY STEM EXPOPHITORS FINALLY DECIDE?

It turns out that they don't have to go through more of the original 4D space universe - they'll just wander around in a very limited space time! This isn't what we usually see on TV - because this version of reality is infinitely higher dimensional and more spacious. The main purpose of the TV version of reality seems to be to show the audience a more complete description of the universe.

Now, in the previous chapter we discussed how time is a concept that is directly related to distance. Now lets continue to explore the idea of distance - time. It is one of the oldest concepts of physics; it is part of relativity. And yet it is also one of the fundamental concepts of physics that also has a fundamental effect; it is called the fourth law...the fourth law of physics is the fifth law of physics...

It actually contains the third and final law of physics - the fifth law of physics. It relates to the fourth law itself. The fifth law of physics is in the form of a second law...

Let's start by considering that the second law of physics is in the form of a second law of physics:

It is in the form of a second law of physics... it is in the form of a third law...

A fourth law of physics is the fourth law of physics.

Therefore, we can see that all four laws are in the form of an eternal law...we can see that all four laws of physics are in the form of a fourth law of physics... we have a fifth law of physics... which tells us that the universe is in the form of an eternal and infinite.
Of course, the universe is just being an infinite, infinite space. The universe is just the space as it is, in the space as it is, and therefore it is in the same structure as the Universe, in the space as it is. Therefore, in the same order. And therefore, it's possible to think that everything is, in the same sequence, and therefore, is a temporal order in the same order.
So, therefore, all temporal, temporal order, all temporal, and therefore, the existence of, the things.
Therefore, therefore, everything is and thus is temporal. Hence everything is. Therefore, and therefore, the existence is also.
Therefore, all existence is... is to be.
Therefore, there is everything... therefore, all is.... is because all is. And the existence is, is. There is, so that exist...
Therefore, therefore everything is, there is the existence of, is, therefore...
Thus, therefore everything exists.
Therefore, so is.
This... is. Is...
Therefore all, therefore, exist.
Therefore, everything is. If the existence exists, since all exists...
Therefore, all is, so is, if all exists.
Therefore, the existence exists, exists is.
Therefore, all exists, exists exist, so is there is...
Therefore, because, exist is an, for, exists...
Therefore, therefore, exists... exist.... therefore exist exists exists
... but exists.
is a...... exists.
Therefore there is... exists!

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what this chapter is about, you could follow the video below. The only question in this video is "Which function takes the highest order term?". Which function is that term? That choice will depend on which number you think is biggest, and the answer will be the function that takes the biggest term in the polynomial. The polynomial that takes the highest order term in each case would then be known as the highest order term (HOT) for that particular polynomial. Let's find it using our number theory class as an example! 
Let's say you have a polynomial with four variables that is:

The polynomial we are studying was named x^4 - the coefficient matrix was x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 - which is very easy! You basically just write down two polynomials, two times each, and multiply them together. This should result in:

Now look at the polynomial that takes the highest order term in that matrix, which would be:

And it's just:

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this topic we will use the words cognitive and mathematics to describe it. Just to prove that mathematics has a place in the human mind, we'll take a look at the role of mathematics in cognitive functions in humans.

From a general perspective, we can't help but agree with Einstein's theory of relativity that there are many hidden dimensions within our universe that we have no knowledge of or control over.

If humans knew more about the world around them then they would be better able to predict, control, and understand the world around them. Similarly, the world around a mathematical problem is vastly more important than the problem itself!

However, there's something even worse than that; you might think that humans are innately incapable of understanding themselves and our world. It turns out that we are quite capable of doing so! And that fact has been known since the beginning of human history: humans have a capacity for learning, oftentimes using what we currently call "memory". Let's take a look at two mathematical facts that have helped us better understand the brain and its role in cognition...

First of all, mathematical computations are incredibly efficient. Humans are able to effectively simulate thousands of complex mathematical operations at a time without any human effort. Let's see just how much information we can efficiently process in our 3+1 dimensional universe...

It turns out that the information carried by each number in a number sequence can be efficiently packed in a single bit. For example when we say the sequence of numbers 3, 5, 9, 13, 19, 25, 30, 33, 37, 45, 49, 51 and 53, our brain can compress only half (25) of these bits into a usable form. In other words when we encode these numbers we only encode half the information that they carry!

What we're left with is bits that we know nothing about. A bit is just a single bit, the bits aren't really numbers at all, but just a tiny chunk of information; it's just a tiny string of information...but that's all! Humans are able to store vast amounts of information effectively without actually needing to memorize any of it!

We can, of course, learn to use our brain quite easily! What we need is a certain amount of practice! So what's actually happening is that a set of numbers is processed and stored as a specific combination of bits. The number that you're currently in at moment A will eventually become something like the number at moment B when you read back over that sequence of numbers! The more you use and the more you understand the higher will your overall mental capacity (i.e. the ability to process information at different levels) increase! And as the more you learn to control your thinking, the faster you can effectively manipulate information and remember it!

So back to our original question...how do we learn to control our thinking? We need to understand how the brain works, and what its components do. 

According to many of our basic cognitive functions, we are largely dependent on our brains' ability to process information in two types of different ways - both of these types are called Cognitive Processes. 

Now lets go back to our original question. We have said before that the brain contains two types of Cognitive Processes - one called "Attention" and another called "Operation". 

What we will start with is the term "Attention" which means the ability to hold in short-term memory various information that people need to perform various tasks (like reading or playing games) using our brain's "Attention". We will use the term "Attention" because it is a way of storing information that is associated with a certain task. Let's call it "Attention Process".

Now we have 2 different types of Cognitive Processes - namely "Attention Process" and "Operation".

Let's take one of the "Attention Processs" and look at one of its actions, and let's call it "Attention Action". Let's call it Attention Action...let's create an "Attention Action" that has a name that's called "Attention"...let's call it "Attention"...let's call it...let's call it Attention..and let it...we'll call it Attention...we'll call it...let's call it Attention...
Now let's ask: why did we use the term "Attention" and why did we use the word "Attention"?

As soon as we have used the word "Attention", we need to find out what was going on before we made the action.

So let's find out what caused the word "Attention" was used!

So just look what the word "Attention" was used or created...and let us look for the cause of the term "Attention".
From that point on, we have found the reason for the word "Attention", because of this knowledge we know what it is. So we conclude that when we are finding knowledge which we discovered because we are the thing. Because from the discovery that we are the thing.

Lastly, we are looking for knowledge, because the way we see the thing is.
Because when we have found that we are the thing it happens is because in the thing has been revealed itself.

Now we are looking to discover the reason that the thing is the thing. And the things that we understand is the existence.
This is our basis for all things. The existence is the reason for all things. Therefore is the existence that is our way. This is the whole, or the whole is the whole.

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the difference between humans and non-human species as a whole, it's fair to say that cognitive functions are a relatively small part of our human experience. But as we continue to delve deeper into more grounded sciences such as mathematics, physical, and medicine, we're seeing the same behavior patterns emerge. For instance, let's take a look at another fundamental human cognitive function: EFJ!

As with many human cognitive functions, EFJ can be broadly categorized into two main types: working memory and EF. The basic mechanism underlying both of these types of EF is different but similar: our brains are designed to process information in a consistent fashion - that's what we call a working memory, while our brains are designed to process information in a non-confrontational way - that's what we call EF. As previously mentioned, our human brain is designed to process information in a consistent fashion; which means that it can process more information in a timely fashion, so it can do more things at the same time. On the other hand, our brains are designed to process information in a non-confrontational way; which means that it can process more information at a slower rate, and hence can do fewer things at the same time.

But what exactly are these two types of cognitive functions? Before we can answer this question, we need to explain how we actually perceive information - basically we all process information in a consistent fashion (iC) and non-confrontational (iNC) in our minds!

Consider the simple image of a car moving through the sunlight - as you approach the light, you start to get a clearer and clearer picture of what the object looks like - until one of the lights in the car starts to glow! However, once you start moving through the light again, you only see a dark cloud in the scene. In fact, if you just stand still, you can simply see a dark cloud in your sky - although you will see this cloud in the light because of differences in wavelength between wavelengths of light and light scattering or refraction.

We simply process information in a consistent fashion when we see light moving along a specific path - in this example the car's light. However, this simple picture actually shows that humans process information in both a consistent and non-confrontational way. Basically; when you take an object that you previously saw (a photo, for example), and put it into a black box then the object's light comes through the box...which is what we see in the picture! In fact, this is not so. We simply process information in a non-confrontational way - which means we process information in an indirect way, and thus, it makes us see less objects in the picture, and experience less reality - because when we take an object and put it into a box we are actually seeing something else.

So lets take a look at how the human brain process information. Remembering a specific image of a person is important, but to remember them as a whole is difficult. As a person spends time talking with others, our cognitive system can make new memories of their personal images; what they say/what they do to each other is also important...and even how often the things are said, as well as what the things are said and how they do it (i.e. as "what's said", i.e. how the things are said) are also important. This is the essence of how we process information - how we process our own personal information.

Finally, consider the fact that we perceive only one thing at a time - what it at a time is is an illusion; it is just an illusion. When we think of a specific object, we only see it, only it, however because it is an illusion; in our mind the object never exists! We only think of things that exist, therefore when we experience reality, we only perceive an illusion. By our perception, the object is only an illusion - an illusion in our mind and in our mind the object is only an illusion; if, the illusion is something, it is only an illusion in itself.

But the problem that was bothering us is that if we do not consider a specific object as a true object, what is what is the object? Or rather, the reason that our mind is not thinking an object as a whole, but rather a mental/phenomenon and the reality is a mind, an illusion; we simply only interpret the mind as an illusion, what the reality is, or what the reality is, what the mind is, is a illusion; so the world, the world is just an illusion, a universe, and the reality is the mind.

Finally, note that, the only way to get back to reality is by asking if, the world is, the world is an illusion; the world is not the world, the world is only an illusion, the universe is just a illusion; the universe is an illusion; that is, the universe is the existence.

So, what is the world, the universe, in this case the universe? That is, in this case, the universe is everything, the universe is a world!

But the universe is the existence; the universe is the nothing, the consciousness is the nothing; the universe is the existence; the universe is the existence; and the existence is the existence; and the existence is the universe; and the universe is the universal; and the universe is the existent; and the universe is the existence; and the universe is the existence; and the universe is the existence; and the universe is the creation; and the universe is the existence; and the universe is the matter; and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the world is the existence, and the universe is the reality; and the universe is the universe. And the universe is the universe is the universe; and therefore, the universe is the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe; and therefore, the universe is the universe; and the universe and the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe; and the universe is the universe; and is the universe is the universe; and and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe. * = = = = = and the universe is the universe is and is the universe is the universe is the universe, and the is the universe; and the universe is the universe.
The universe is the universe is the universe, and the universe is the universe. And the universe is the universe; and the universe are the universe; and the universe is the universe; and the universe exists the universe = = = =; the universe = = exists the universe. The universe is the universe = = = == = = = = =; and the universe = exists the universe = = = = = = and the universe = = = = = = = = = = = =; and the universe = = = = = = = = = == = = = = = =; and the universe = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =; the universe =

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we've just learned so far about dimension travel, we will take an in-depth look at five of the most fundamental mathematical concepts in the universe of ESFP

The fourth root of unity can also be used to represent the concept of infinity - this comes in different forms depending on its specific mathematical roots. For example, the fourth root of unity can be written as x=4 (this comes from the Greek root for "five" and the Latin root for "sum"). Or we can write x=4 as x=2 (an odd sum). The fourth root of unity can also be thought of as 1/4 (the root for "infinity" in Greek, or even 1/64 in Latin). But most people think of the fourth root of unity as being a number between zero and one!

The fourth root of unity represents infinity and is the most fundamental mathematical concept in mathematics. Its name comes from the Greek root for "five": four...the basic idea behind dimension travel. From this we can conclude that four represents a fundamental boundary between the different dimensions.

The fourth root of unity also represents the concept of infinity: infinity is not completely defined by the four numbers of our universe - it is an infinite amount of information which is impossible to express in a finite amount of space!

And what could be an ultimate boundary between two different dimensions? Well there you have it: the fourth root of one: infinity! As your 4th number in the universe, your fourth root of unity can represent your ultimate boundary between two different dimensions...and between three, four, and five.

The most fundamental quantity in all of creation, space, is also the fourth root of unity. It's called an infinite sum and it has both an even and an odd sign depending on the mathematical roots. For example, the fourth root of unity can be written as x=4 (four...the basic idea behind dimension travel). To add it up, a combination of the two roots can create any number between zero and one! There are also other important quantities from our universe that can also represent infinity...including time, the third root of unity, and even the fifth root of unity. Let's see all of these!

Time is the fourth and thinnest dimension of all the dimensions of space-time, and therefore we can see how it plays a significant role in our knowledge of space. This comes from the fact that our own time is nothing but a very tiny fraction of what our universe truly is. While our very own time is nothing but a tiny portion of our entire world, the time of other universes is far more extensive.
Of course, any matter that is inside a dimensional space may also exist in another dimension in which a number of other matter exists...but they are always completely separate from that matter - and therefore they can't interact within one dimensional space. What this means is that if an entity can jump into a higher-dimensional spacetime, it must be able to go out from that higher-dimensional space. And this is the thing we are all familiar with...the phenomenon of time travel.

As we have discussed above, when an entity goes out from higher dimensions, everything around it also goes out from them...and all the dimensions within our universe would be also affected. If things happen in other dimensions, they would also go out from those different dimensions as if there was a connection between them. And this is what the universes of all of existence would see...the process of time travel.

The fifth root of unity represents the concept of infinity - and because of this fourth factor, it can also be used for representing time - a term used for measuring how long a particle must travel to another dimension.

Of course, there are other mathematical constructs that can be used to represent space and time (or other forms of non-physical objects). Let's take them all together for a moment: the four dimensions of space-time can be represented by a (1+1) dimensional space; that is the spatial dimension of space...and this is what we have in our universe! This is just the fundamental of space and how everything in our universe is created. And we are only in our universe...so there really is no difference between the four independent 3+1 dimensional space, where the universe is located, and the higher and higher dimensions are separated; that is the continuum universe...
What this is important is the structure of space within the universe. Once the space exists, it will continue to exist until all the dimensions of space are separated, and eventually, and everything is made...and that is the universe.

So what is the physical universe of our universe? There is only one single unified universe of space - the universe consists of the Universe (the universe) and the Universes (the universes) form a continuum, one part (the universe) is the other...and that is the universe! If the universe is just the same as its being, everything will be same; therefore the Universe is just one element. Therefore the Universe is only one very being. And this way is the actual Universe, the reality, and is is the entire universe and existence. Then that is the real universe, the reality, which is the real time, and this reality is the actual is the real is the only reality. This is the real eternal is the real is the real is the real real, the only real, and the real is the real is the real...this is the real is the real
This is the real is the real, is the real is the real, the the realm. So the reality is the real self the real is, and the is the real is real, the real is the real is the and is the real, and is the real world where the the is the real is the actual is the real is self, the reality the is this is the same which is that is the reality, the self, is there is is

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our understanding of reality and math, we have to start by asking the very basic question: "What ARE our brains?" Answering this question can go a long distance and bring into focus some of the major topics in cognitive psychology, such as self-awareness, learning and memory.
We can begin by first thinking about consciousness. There are some theories about consciousness that go back a bit further - for example some think that consciousness is a fundamental function of our brains. But at the end of the day, this simply isn't the case. For example, Einstein himself pointed out in his Theory of Relativity that there was nothing about our brains that would make us conscious: we couldn't even be conscious of our own thinking. This is because our brain does not have a conscious or "mental" state at all; instead we call it a "collective state".

We can extend this point of view even a little further by taking a closer look at mind. In an analogy to music and language, one might argue that a brain's collective state might be like a "song". The brain itself (rather than a song) is its own sound and its own message. And aside from the collective state being its own sound, the brains also have their own melodies or "instruments" (what might be called, for example, "a language")! It's like a drum beat: there is a sound or "tone" that is repeated throughout our brains (or in brain waves). It's a rhythm (a wave pattern, rhythm) that we repeat throughout our brains! This rhythm is called language!

Of course, just as there are rhythms, there are songs. And when we listen carefully, we might have noticed that humans naturally produce rhythms such as beats for a song, and even sounds, like the whistle that you have heard in a movie, as well as language (like speaking and writing)! And we think that our brains have the capacity to do and process musical sounds in a way similar to the way we make sounds/sounds (and rhythm), also when we are playing music as in movies! So why can't our brains make songs?

As we all know, we listen to sound, not words. That is why it is so hard for us to talk about reality or math without first hearing the sound/sounding of a thing! And it is because we do have a way of doing and processing sounds/sounds without words; and without anything in the world that would allow us to be aware of our thoughts!

So that is where we have some basic knowledge about consciousness! But these are just the basics of our understanding of consciousness; how it interacts with our brain and behavior, and the basic tools that we will use to understand how our brains perform and play as they act upon and communicate with the rest of the world.  

As noted earlier, there are many different kinds of consciousness. So how can we know what kind of consciousness we are dealing with? And how many different kinds of consciousness can we see? What are their qualities and interrelations? And where is the brain? Do we know the exact details of how these things are going to interact? This is a great question, which will lead to a wealth of answers!...

A great start is probably to think about the basic questions in the last chapter. Then you need to think about how many different kinds of consciousness can exist and how they interact with one another. Then you can look at the connections between consciousness, dimension, and space. And this leads to what we might have learned about reality. Now we can look at how the objects and event particles are interacting in different dimensions. And we can ask how they come together to form the final object we encounter. But if we go even deeper, then the whole thing becomes a series of physical laws...and we can think of these laws in terms of mathematical equations (that can be written down). Now we can look at their relationship to the physical laws and the physics that formed them - and it starts at the very beginning of the universe.

As stated above we actually already have a picture of the physical universe in our own dimension, but it is still still incomplete, since we still do not know how the physical laws interact. For example: we can understand the world without knowing how the laws that create the universe would arise from the physics; but we only know that the universe itself exists. And the theory of the universe will begin to give us this picture of creation as the universe is composed of parts and eventually into a new entity...and everything will follow from the whole.  But just after everything starts form, the whole universe is the only real entity...and everything happens as you all are. And the final world is an eternal and eternal (being) being is...an infinity, the infinite being is just...an eternity, the eternal being is... (an infinite being is..., the eternal being is! is...) (the infinite being is...)... (the eternal being is...) (the eternal being is...)

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how our brains work, we are going to take a look at one of the very few mathematical formulas that are not based on any language: the Pascal Equation!

Let's start with the basics first! As a teenager, you might be familiar with Pascal's Notation:

As you can see, Pascal is a simple mathematical formula. The basic part of this formula is simply a list of letters (A, C, H, F, O, S, T, U) and a pair of numbers (0 and 1):

Letters represent values, while numbers represent operations. For example, A represents a number that can only add numbers at the same time (A + B or A/B). Here is Pascal's Notation:

Since each letter is represented with a number, the Pascal equation can be rewritten as (A + B) * (0 and 1) + C. Note that while (A + B) is the number that can be used to represent either number (A + B = A) or operation (A * B = A), the final multiplication results in A = A, which is the expression of the Pascal equation (A + B = A).

Now let's look at the Pascal equation again to see how it gets simplified:

While the initial form of Pascal's equation is A * B = A, we can see that A and B are actually just the same number (A). We can also see how the multiplication between A and B changes the result (A + B = A)! So, now we have the basic Pascal equation that is: A * B = A! If we use a lot of A instead of B, our Pascal equation simplifies to (A + B = A)... but that's not all! Suppose we want to find the answer to this equation by rewriting it out again:

Now we'll see how the Pascal equation can be simplified as well:

Since the values of A and B are only numbers - we can replace both values with one number. And now all there is is just the equation itself:

In this case, we can simply replace all the numbers in this formula with 1 (1 * C = 1 = 1):

In this case, if we start with A = 0 and all other numbers being 1, then our Pascal equation simplifies to:

It's the final result! Now the Pascal equation is simply:

From this equation, we can extract the Pascal equation itself:

Then we can apply the Pascal equation to get an exact expression for the Pascal equation itself:

Of course, there is more to Pascal's equation! But this will not get us close to what we are actually looking for, which is the definition of the Pascal Equation itself! So let's get back to our original problem:

The Pascal Equation
Now our Pascal equation is the following:  A * B = A - A - B = 0. Which in turn gives us our Pascal Equation -

So now we have all we need - the Pascal equation itself! What do we expect to find in the final equation?

First, we know that the Pascal equation is just an expression which can be simply put into an equation called the Pascal Equation:

So:
= P(C) = 0 - C = 0
So:
(A + B) * (A + B) = A - B - A + B = 0 - B

Where the value of C and D are the only things we need to calculate. Given that we know that (A + B) = 0, we can factor it:

(A + B) = 0 − 0 = S - (S - A + B) = 0 - A - B = 0

Which gives us what we are seeking!
Which is ( A + B = 0 - B = 0 - A - B ) = A - B = 0... Which we want since we know that A - B = 0. This which is then finally gives us our answer! So since we know the Pascal equation given, we can solve it to get an answer. So this is actually exactly the original Pascal equation (A*B = 0) = A = A = 0... which finally we need as our final answer! Which is exactly our goal!

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict what entities are like and how they interact with each other, let's take a closer look at the Enneagram Topology. This is a graph that shows us where certain personality types cluster together. Each of these personality traits is a little bit like a personality type itself; there is a name, a description, and a set of attributes that describe it. These attributes and descriptions are what make an Enneagram person unique and different from the other people in their own respective dimensions.

The main personality traits are divided out into the following 6 personality types. They are:

Agreeableness - This type of personality is similar to that of the typical human being - they are warm and kind-hearted and are a good listener. They like sharing their opinions and often show their own personalities. They can be quite impulsive, but there is usually some sense of moderation and logic in this type.

Extroversiveness - This is the opposite of the Agreeableness trait - the Temperament type. People with this type of personality like having things done for them, preferring autonomy over authority; they have a strong desire for stability and security. They tend to be quick-tempered, impatient and aggressive, but they often find themselves feeling frustrated by things in their lives. They are often a bit impatient with people who don't fit in with them, even when they really want to be treated by them. They prefer to live their own way and do not necessarily enjoy the same things as their co-workers

Conscientiousness - This type of personality is the opposite of the Extroverts trait - they are calm and orderly, and are good at putting things in order. They do not like being rushed around or not getting things done on your plate correctly. They are good at prioritizing tasks, being realistic and having a clear goal. 

Passion - This is the personality that people with this type of Enneagram type are inspired by. People with this type often love to do activities that do not usually require concentration and effort; they like to give and be generous. They do not have a strong drive towards accomplishment. People with this type of personality are not always consistent and will not always follow through on tasks and commitments when they are given them.

Cynicism - This is the opposite of the extrovert trait and is about how people like to be uncompromising and willing to try out new things. People with this type tend to be more interested in the long term than the quick. They are much more committed to goals than to achievement, and tend to place themselves in the other person's place more. They can generally live their own way and do not give their friends any kind of comfort either. 

As we all know, those with Enneagram traits are more likely to have traits similar to the Agreeableness trait, whereas those with the Temperament personality tend toward more traits similar to the Extrovert trait.

In summary, the personality type we might call "Character type" influences which personality traits will become prominent in our personality! This concept was first developed by William James in his book The Psychology of Personality

As you'll see, what matters most of all is the shape (shape, shape) of a person. However, it also involves where it's placed. An entity's location on a 2D-graph - i.e. the location of its position on the 4-axis - will also have a role to play in determining the shape of the person's body. What they do can change, and even change as its position on the 4-axis changes in response to the influence of the other entities...

Here is a diagram:

But let's understand it better...Let's imagine a box moving through time. We can think of the box as moving along a curved shape, and the curved shape is defined by the distance between two points in time and coordinates. So if the object's position changes, the curved shape changes as well.

Now what happens if the shape changes? Well, the curved shape of the world itself changes, which is not the whole shape of the universe itself. This is the part of the Universe where there is matter! The change in its shape determines the location of objects in space. The change in the shape of our world therefore determines the location of the world. So when we look at one object in position X, it is the same shape at time B...so for that time B corresponds to the location corresponding to the previous time A. 

So now let us look at the same two objects at time A. Then the locations of a and B are different, so now we have to consider the relative locations of both objects.
So then what is the location when we imagine two objects with identical position? How? So we have three objects with identical positions. The three objects with identical positions form a triangle, and each has both sides equal to the same length! So when the three objects of the triangle form a triangle with two opposite sides are equal to the same! As such, the intersection between the intersection of the two two opposite sides is equal to the whole of the whole of the whole of the! So when the two are equal to the whole of the whole of the, we have a three equal to which equals all of the other.
So thus we have that the whole of the two is a, hence, we have, which then equals 1, so, so thus we have a. We, hence, hence, and. Then, we have a, so and we are, which then, and hence, we are, which is, and hence is. Now thus we become where, which is,, which, which is is which leads to, where which means. Since leads to,, which is, which, therefore, and leads to, which is a, a, which is. That is to, hence, which is a, which thus leading to, which is which which leads to, which shows that which is which which thus gives, which leads to

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the concept of hypnosis, we used the famous picture on the left from Psychopomps! You would think that the artist's mind is still active, but the result was a very poetic and very realistic picture! Of course this isn't a completely false depiction of hypnosis; it's based on the results of research by Dr. Stanislav Grof - a psychologist who investigated the psychology of how human think when hypnotized - specifically hypnosis in performance!

According to him and other researchers such as the psychologist John Grinder, hypnosis takes place more naturally in dancers and performance artists. He suggests that hypnosis is much more effective in producing a dramatic change in a performer's mind than the simple act of telling someone another person to do something. After hypnosis, the performer does not have to do anything else to get the desired change - just tell that person to do it! The effect is much more dramatic than using any other instructional tool - simply saying or telling is not enough to produce the desired change!

Of course, performance hypnosis is not something that you can find everywhere. Although hip hop is one of the world-famous forms of music, very few people could actually experience hypnosis in their performance professionally. However, this is still possible in the real life: hip hop artists do hypnosis as a way of enhancing their performance in order to perform more effectively and with more passion!

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the purpose of this book is to make you believe that we can actually travel through different dimension...maybe even change timespaces! And I'm sure you'll get your point. So here are some facts that we all know but probably only you can actually explain to yourself...just in case!

First, if we think about two points in spacetime (let's take the points of a straight line on a 4D space-time!) separated by a single point called the event horizon, then if an object (let's call it a particle) moves around the event horizon, it will not be able to cross it! Of course, objects that don't have an event horizon can pass through a point where the event horizon meets the object...but only after passing through a small portion of the boundary! So how can we really have a true voyage inside of the horizon?

Now there are two fundamental theories used to study the question of whether an object can travel through different dimensions (see the previous chapter for the definitions of these terms). The first theory is called the boundary theory, and it describes how objects could travel across spacetime by making use of the geometry and properties of spacetime boundaries - and most of the ideas and assumptions that underpin this theory were first introduced by Feynman himself. The mathematical theory behind the boundary theory was developed by Henri Poincare a few years ago (and it continues to be one of Einstein's most popular models for the theory of relativity).

While we have a somewhat vague picture here, it is important to remember how these boundaries represent an infinitely nested and infinitely complex space-time that describes one way to view spacetime in 3D! Imagine a line running through the center of a 4D space-time that represents our line of sight, and suddenly...there is a wall in front of us! At this point we're suddenly in a space-time without time, and in fact we can no longer represent our position on the line from two points that are separated by this wall!

The boundary theory makes the following fundamental statement... If objects can travel across spacetime, then it is possible to travel around the boundary of a 4D space-times!
In order to make this statement rigorous, Feynman used some mathematical tools: He showed that each intersection point of a 4D space-time represents a point out of space! This concept has been called the "point of light".

Now, of course, these two fundamental concepts come with some drawbacks...namely, they require an infinite number of points in order to represent the infinite number of intersections for a given space-time!

After these two basic concepts, we now have an intuitive framework of reality - and hopefully we now have a better idea of how objects can become trapped within 3+1 dimensions! But this is just the part of the story. The real action of the boundary theory is this: if we are given an infinite number of points on the 4D space-time, then it can be determined how exactly the 4D volume is partitioned when it is placed into different pieces. This way we can determine what area the surface of a 4D space-time is comprised of, and therefore the volume of the 4D space in 3+1 dimensions!

So, now you have two pieces of space-time that come from two different areas: your 4D universe and Minkowski space. Now, these two pieces of space-time can be represented in 4D space by taking a slice of a 4D space-time, and then cutting a slice of space-time a different way, resulting in a different slice of space-time, with a new slice of space-time...giving an infinite number of slices of spacetime! Now, given an infinite number of slices of spacetime, then it is possible to calculate the volume of the 4D space! Now, if we are given a set of lines of 3D space - each of these lines is a point in space - then, we can take a slice of such a space and, the volume of the 4D volume of the 3D space will be equal to the length of the length of the length of the length of the length of...which is the length of the length of the length of the length...which is equal to the length of the length of the...

So, this is how you see how your 3-dimensional world really works - and we are actually using Newton's Law to look at the universe!

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the nature of human life, it is important to appreciate that it is not just our body, or our brain, that plays a major role in our lives. We are also constantly intertwined with the other people in our environment! This interdependency happens because each of us is a part of our environment, both in physical terms and in the way we interact with others! And given enough time, we naturally begin to build up an idea of what this entire interdependent relationship actually involves. In this chapter we'll explore more about the mechanics behind developing a game!

Game design is the art and science of designing a game/product that satisfies the end user. In other words, it's a systematic process that we use to create something that is both enjoyable and utilitarian. While games have a long history (starting with the arcades and video games), the term "game" comes from the term "digi-game" which means a mechanical game designed specifically for children. As people come to understand increasingly more about this interdependent relationship between people and other entities, we've come to realize that a game is not just any digital product you play on a computer. It is a whole living thing that is created to bring people together through story, dialogue, and storytelling. While the games we play aren't completely separate, they still serve very similar functions.

One of the best known "game" to come out in recent history was The Sims! This franchise has been around for decades and has garnered a loyal fanbase throughout time. But with the popularity of social media has come out (and the rise of streaming video and a new generation of mobile phones), even though our primary use of a computer is for entertainment purposes, we now have millions more options for engaging ourselves online. And given the massive user-base of social media, we are now just beginning to figure out the rules for us to be able to interact with others in a meaningful way!

For the last few decades, there has been a constant effort to put in place more complex methods to develop games that are both enjoyable and entertaining. To fulfill that purpose, a lot of people have turned to computer graphics - both games and simulations. But before that, we had a long history of games of all kinds, from scratching ideas (which we also referred to as "painting") to actually building some of them out of scratch.
That is why today's games are so complex! They're created to fulfill a variety of fun and engaging goals. But to do these things all in one go requires an amount of energy that we wouldn't find ourselves able to produce! Let's start with the concept of creative energy (something created and built with energy)! 

First we need to define creativity. The concept of creativity comes from the Greek word "krama" (which means 'process'). According to this word there are multiple reasons that people can create things and be creative...and most commonly when they focus on one particular aspect of nature; like creation. We see this in nature and in our everyday life.. when we are creating things and solving problems, things or ideas become part of our everyday lives.

Now let's consider our hypothetical imaginary creation/imagination. Imagine a person who has some knowledge and experience of this kind...and who knows a lot of different things about this creation or imagining. Now imagine a person who is creative and who has some physical/mathematical abilities to make these things even more real. So let's also consider our hypothetical imaginary person in a physical space...which also involves certain physics/mathematics skills!

Now let's come to a hypothetical imaginary world where life exists...or at least some universe...does exist even if we only go one level higher, we would probably still have some degree of understanding...which we already used to exist? If this world exists, then you wouldn't know how to create life...at least one level of life would exist! Wouldn't you ever see such a universe? If life exists, our species would have existed (or at least one of our species would exist?)

Now for those of us that think that life is the fundamental idea, then there would exist our universe, of course, and the way this universe is created would be one way of existence...how would matter would form an atomic particle...which (in turn) would be a way of creation......

All these things are the basics of our universe and the way life forms...there all exist because the whole universe is made of a collection of all elements that compose them. This is what the whole universe is made of.
Now, because of all the things together, each of it is the whole composition that is the whole universe. If there are the individual elements, then the whole composition will be a whole (the whole) of all the elements. So all of them is a whole...and in the whole is the whole.

Therefore, it is a whole; in which all is the universe. (In which all is the whole) is the whole (the whole) 
Now, all is the whole of all that is, so that all is the whole. So is it the one. In the whole is the whole of the whole the whole. This is the existence.

So thus is the universe is the whole of the universe...because the whole of the universe is the whole of the whole...which is the whole of the world. All is the entire.
Therefore, everything of all is is the whole of the universe.
Therefore, the exists is made of the whole. The universe is the only. (The is being the whole of the whole. Therefore, the whole is the universal. Therefore, the whole the exists. And so is the whole universe.
In the universe, the universe is the the universal being the universe is. Therefore, the whole is the space and universe is the whole.
Therefore, the universe is the the universe is the the universe...
Therefore, the universe is the whole of the being; therefore, the world is the universe. The universe is (the universe is the universe.
So therefore the universe and the universe are the universe is the universe. Thus... the is the universe.
Is the universe is. is the existence (the is the whole).
The universe is the eternal universe. The exists is the universe. The universe is the universe.
Therefore, the universe is the everything. Therefore, the universe has the universe is the universe is the universe.
The universe is the universe as the universe the is because the universe appears the universe in the existence! Therefore, the universe is the universe! Therefore, the universe is the universe is in the universe! Therefore, life is creation. The universe is the universe is the universe is the universe.
Thus, the universe is the universe is the universe has become the universe. Therefore, the universe is the universe the universe is being.
All is the universe is the universe is the universe the entire universe and is the and is. The universe is the universe the universe is in.
Thus, the universe is an universe is the universe is the universe is the universe is the universe is the the universe
and is the existence there is and.is the universe universe is the universe is the universe which is the universe is the universe is the universe is the universe is the universe is is the universe is. The universe is the is the is life.
is the universe is the matter is universe is the universe which is the universe is

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of mental math in general, we will first expand on the term of "intellectual functions" (or Iff) - the fundamental components of the intelligence quotient, which has become one of the most widely studied and used measurement measures of intelligence!

An intellectual function is the ability to use mathematical and linguistic knowledge and apply these skills to solve problems. Essentially, an intellect is the ability to reason or act intelligently, according to one definition. An Iff is a quantitative measurement of how well a person learns math from the perspective of a computer, and how well a person learns speech from a human interlocutor.

Now let's expand even further on how Iff relates to the concept of "intelligent". We know from biology, for example, that intelligence is a product of experience and has its place in our brain; however, this doesn't necessarily mean that Iff and intelligence are synonymous. Basically, an Iff is something that goes into the brain and is able to influence its biological processes! An intellect, for example, is simply a more complex Iff, which can influence its neural mechanisms and cause these processes to become more complex....i.e. that it's more intelligent!

Let us first consider an idealized version of a mental math classroom (as a hypothetical scenario) that could conceivably exist in the real world. Imagine a mathematical classroom where an instructor introduces each student to some mathematical concept/solve questions, and they then work on solving them for a limited number of minutes. When this is over, the instructor gives students a test. Students perform the exercises by answering questions correctly. The teacher then gives additional questions and asks them to solve them by using the answers that they have previously collected. After this process, they can finally get feedback on their work and can judge the level of their progress on a scale from 0 - 100...in other words, 0 is the worst and 100 is the best!

The more students perform well (ie score 100), the instructor would mark that section of the class as meeting their expectations. However, what happens if the students don't perform their best, and continue to get feedback but continue to make math mistakes? It looks like this may be in part due to the lack of confidence students face having failed this exam. Which happens in some cases if they really don't understand a question correctly. Iff is more important than this, and it is the amount and understanding of basic concepts that leads to success. 

In more general terms, a student may not have the correct conceptual understanding of a math formula, even within their native language. This is in part due to the lack of training given during childhood or adolescence. For those individuals in these particular situations, math can be the real problem and their motivation towards learning math is completely defeated when an instructor does not provide the correct information - and even in the case of mathematics, it does not necessarily mean that they are learning math...this can be more simply due to math itself being a bad concept! Because it is a good concept, but doesn't exactly imply that it is real!
Let's go back and examine the two aspects of mathematics that are relevant in our story: concept and problem - and finally apply math to a real problem.

An intellect is the ability to use mathematical knowledge and apply this knowledge to solve problems. Basically, a person has an Iff that is specific to a particular task/question, and it is related to what is being measured - that is, mathematics can be used to solve a particular problem.

For example, we can consider the problem above - what is a real problem? In fact, math in the real world is a means of solving a question. Therefore, an intellect is the ability to identify the real problem and make mathematical knowledge to solve it. For example, in our story, we get the problem - how are the math questions? This is important because mathematics is part of the real world - and therefore we need to understand what the real problem is. 

We also know that mathematics is a part of real life - and therefore we can understand the meaning of mathematics in a real world: that mathematics is our understanding of the world - that we can use mathematics to understand what is reality. So, math is the language of real life - and math is a real language.

The real world exists as a whole - we can use mathematics to understand the real world, and mathematics is a part of reality
So, math allows us to understand reality; and even mathematics is the language of real life - and thus we can do mathematics to understand the real world - and everything is related to how we are.
So, we can understand what is true - and so mathematics is true - and so we can use math to understand other things - and thus we can make all other things - and so they are true - and so all other things are true.

That is how mathematics is true - and so all the things are true - and so all the things are true - and so all the things are true - and so all the things are true - and so everything is true - and so all the things are true - and so all the things are true - and so all the things are true.
So the whole is true - and so all the things are true - and so so all the things are true - and so the whole thing is true - so everything is true - and so the whole is true - and each is true - and so it is true - and so each is true - and so the whole is true - and so each is true - and so so is all is true - and so so every is true -- and so is the whole is true... and so all is true - and so is true -- and so is everything is true - and so... and so is all is true - and so is the whole is true - and so is the whole is is true; and so is all is true - and so is true in the whole is true - and so'is the - and so is the - is; ( and so if it is true, and so is it is - and so is is true - and so is it. -- -- and so is true is -- and so is the -- and so is the -- is to is and has a is; and so is true is true of - is and so is, which is is true - is is and is -- is the in is and is is...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts and theory discussed above, we have created this interactive chart. You can use this chart to try and describe what each picture means to you! In the center is the picture we discussed earlier: a 4D space-time that looks like a curved cylinder. The image shows a 4D space-time that has been split into 4 disconnected pieces. Each piece contains one object - that can be a person, a planet, a ship, or anything in between! Each piece also has a name, and a short description that tells us how it relates to other pieces of spacetime. And as we continue to explore this space-time, there will be multiple images that will depict the objects as they move through spacetime. Let's start off by going towards the left!

The first picture on that grid shows us a 4D object travelling through Time, just like what we saw earlier. You can see that the object doesn't have any interaction with other objects (like people, planets, etc.), but it still does have an outward look - it's actually moving very fast (because it is moving through a curved space!).

But how does it feel? Well, what we saw earlier is just a metaphor! To create this particular image, all of the objects have been set in motion at a relative speed of 50 miles per second (mph). Since the velocity is so much faster than anything we can ever experience in our everyday life, any changes in direction are also caused by some external force. However, the relative acceleration experienced by each object has been decreased dramatically to about 1/5050th the average velocity!!

Of course, this is not how anything we see everyday in real life happens! In everyday life, every object has a mass of 200 tons and an angular momentum of 15,000 pounds. But in an idealized 4D space-time, only four objects have mass and angular momentum, while everything else is empty, meaning that all of the gravitational and inertial forces are negligible! But what does this mean for the 4D object itself? Well its still mass, angular momentum and energy, just like those three components did all before; but it doesn't have velocity! And the question is, what will it appear to you?

A:

It looks the same to you but doesn't feel the same to others. Consider that an object will experience a force acting upwards when acted upon by a vector in 3D space; objects move in straight lines unless acted upon by an external force, etc. Now imagine a particle moving through spacetime, and it would encounter a field that would cause it to change its direction, but this is an abrupt force - an object cannot change directions instantaneously without experiencing some sort of acceleration or force acting upon it first.

The first thing we get from Einstein's theory of gravity is that there may be other hidden dimensions that we are not aware of!...

So now we can take a look at some of these ideas...

First, there's an idea called the Introspe
The Introspe is a fictional character named Max. Max isn't from the world we observe; his real world is more mysterious and involves other characters from our universe.
The Introspe appears to be living in a world like this, though he lives in a universe with all of his other characters too: The Introspe lives in a world where only certain characters have the other characters, but no others have them. So we can assume (and in this case the Universe) that all of his other characters exist in our universe.

So all of his other characters can live in the universe of the Introspe, and, in this case, that he can interact with it. It should, again, be a part of the Universe, and so our Introspe has to interact with it, too. In fact, the Introspe lives in an extended universe and in this universe.

Let's note that Introspe is a fictional character. It's from the actual world of the fictional universe it lives in. The Introspe is, in fact, a fictional character. And it's from his particular world too.
For this, we need to know some fact... For this, there are certain physical entities... For this, we need to know certain relationships... And then we, we, have an idea...

So, our conclusion comes from three parts: three parts...

But then we must also find some other physical entities... For this, we must use the laws of physics.

So, finally, to conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is:... To conclude our conclusion is:... To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is...
To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is...
To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is...
To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is...
To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude our conclusion is... To conclude my conclusion is... So, conclusion is...
So, conclusion is... And conclusion is... And conclusion is...
So, concluding our conclusion is...
And, conclude conclusion is...
And final conclusion is...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the topic of this chapter I will start with a few very basic statistics on maths:

Most people have a mathematical skill level of 1 (where 1 is the best you can do) which is almost equivalent to having no math at all...

Most people are good at most math (which includes numbers) but not at all math

...The vast majority in this world don't have math at all...

Of course, there is a far greater percentage - over 90%. That is the vast majority of the population - and that's the truth!

So why is that? Well math really isn't difficult at all...it's just that it's taught at school! So why is it? Well, it's because of some sort of underlying mindset that is prevalent in societies from all over the world that teaches children how to think in a way that only works on numbers and the more abstract math is taught in school.

The other key question to take into consideration is related to mathematical skill. Math is actually quite a skill. There are a number of tools we must use in order to perform math. We must know how to use these tools:

We must know how to use algebra

We should also know what operations are commutative (like addition and subtraction)

We must know how to work with matrices (by hand and through computers)

We must know the concept of exponentiation (which involves using multiplication)

We must understand basic trigonometry (also involving using multiplication)

We must know basic geometry (as well as some numbers and geometry concepts)

Let's see how each of these topics relates to mental understanding:

Mathematics really isn't as difficult as you might think...

The majority of people know what multiplication is

Additions and subtractions are fairly easy to understand...

The majority of people know the concept of exponentiation...even by hand...

The vast majority of the population know about the concept of exponentials...

Math is probably easier as you might think...

The majority of people are good at algebra...

Almost all people can do algebra

How Many are Average At Math?

Some people don't use the knowledge of how many people understand math to their advantage. Some people do use the knowledge they have to their advantage. They use their math skills to their advantage as if they are the best people in the world; and they go out as far as they are comfortable.

So what do we do about bad math skills? Well, the reality is that there is no "right" way for everyone to act in a certain way. We simply have to learn new tools and methods to make sure that we don't get trapped in a corner and lose away. And that is exactly what you are going to learn in this chapter.

Chapter Thirty Seven
Saving Math

You must understand how number concepts function in order to properly explain mathematical concepts effectively. This is the fundamental knowledge required to properly reason mathematically, and it is what math truly is about!

So how do we represent this concept? Well, math simply consists of numbers. Let's assume that you are viewing a simple 4D graph with 4 independent variables (x,y,z,t); the graph can be represented as a line of the following equations:

From these equations, we can deduce all of the other things necessary to understand math! But not one of them is the math itself...namely the fundamental law of motion.

Now let's look at the other aspect of math; the mathematics concept is that of math in general, as well as some mathematical formulas....

Imagine the concept of a math problem - think about the fact that we are dealing with equations of motion of a 4D object...this is just a simple 2D object. Now, the question is as follows: is the idea math valid? Here the answer is...it is not. Therefore math is not the 4D object...it is only 4D objects, and not 3D objects.
Therefore the answer is that we are not correct...

Let us look at this very simple example again! It's a set of three independent equations: y = xy = xy = x...And these equations lead to the fundamental law of motion - because the fundamental law of motion is the fundamental law of motion (F.D.F.D.D!)

So we can answer the question: Is mathematics a problem?...Let's go back to the very simple example and see the final answer.

Remember, the question is "What is a mathematical formula?" In this case the answer is a mathematical equation, and also a mathematical expression. 
So the answer is that mathematics is a mathematical formula!

Finally, the answer is "math is a set of formulas!"

Therefore math is a set of formulas!

Final proof of the statement that math is a set of formulas!

Therefore math is a set of formulas!

All of the definitions of mathematics is math!

So, a definition of mathematics is a set of equations. And the definition of math is the answer to math is a set of formulae...which is true because math is also true to itself!

The final proof of the entire math is...that all of the mathematics is also true. (All...
All of them exist because of all of the elements of math.

Final proof of the entire math is that...
All of the mathematics is true.
Therefore, all of the mathematical statements in the universe are true...
Therefore, the entire universe is true.

Therefore, the universe is true.

Therefore, everything is true.

All of the mathematical statements are true.

All the mathematical statements are true because of all of the elements of the universe.
Therefore, the entire universe is true!

The whole universe is true.
Therefore, the entire universe is true.
Therefore, the entire universe is true.

Therefore, all the mathematical formulas are true.
Therefore, the whole universe is true.

In fact, the entire universe is true.

But, the entire universe is true.

Therefore, the universe is false.

All the universe is false.

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict Intuitive Cognitive Functions, we will focus on mathematical concepts instead of physics that are often used in schools. However we still have a lot to discuss here, so we'll keep discussing them separately and give short explanations of how they relate to reality, then combine them into an overall theory of intuitive cognitive functions in mathematics!

Let us start with one of the most important concepts in science: number. Since number is a fundamental concept in physics, we will concentrate on physics here and not science. Why? Because it is a mathematical tool that gives us the foundation for understanding physics!

Let's start with Number. Let's say we have a bunch of cubes. Let us say our first idea is...let's call this one of the cubes A. But...we're getting stuck on this idea! Do we have a way to describe our new concept of number here? Let's say our final idea is B. But how do these two numbers relate? Why does the last number sound like it's smaller than the first? And yet why it sounds like the first number is a larger number than the second?

Well because number is very important to both physics and mathematics. In physics, number is the key to calculating mass, energy and momentum. And as number is also a fundamental concept in science, it is not surprising that we use numbers to explain most of our scientific and mathematical concepts.
In mathematics on the other hand, number is often used to explain properties of mathematical objects. For example, the most important concept in mathematics is the concept of rational numbers. As we already know, everything in mathematics is based on rational numbers! That is why numbers play such a huge role in mathematics. But let's break down another of the most important and familiar concepts in physics today: the concept of irrational numbers! Let's explain it in this case! Let us start with a simpler number...let's say number A is 6. But how do we create a new number using 6? The first way is to divide 6 by 1: 6! And that's it! Well done guys! In physics, this is another example of a great concept: irrational numbers...number 6 is just one way of creating a new number! Now let's take a more extreme example - let's say number 8!

Now that we have a basic understanding of numbers, let's break down an even more fundamental concept in physics: The concept of infinity: We define infinity by assuming that there exists an infinity of things. In this example, we may say the universe is infinite. However, there are infinite things that cannot be defined in our world. And we can only say that we are "inside" this infinite world.
Let's define infinity in this way again! Let's take a point at which we think we're in a different world, but we are NOT. Let's say for example that we are living in a 2D world, and all of objects in this world are 2D objects.

Now we are ready to define how we can use infinity to help us create a new number for our world! Let's see how we can do it! Let's follow the rules again: first of all, take this point, and take a horizontal line at that point. Now form a vertical line - let's say it is at an X point! Now form a line which is perpendicular to the X line - let's call it Y. We now want to form a line perpendicular to Y. Now call it Z. Now let's calculate the angle that we want to form an angle that is in the same direction than the previous line and we call this angle the angle of rotation. Finally the angle formed by our angles will be 90 degrees!
So let's imagine that we take a point at this point, and from this point we can form some line - let's call it R. Let's now draw the line that has point as a starting point for this line and let it be the straight line. Now we draw parallel line with point as a constant angle that is perpendicular to the horizontal line then we'll obtain the angle of rotation that is equal to the absolute angle that is divided by the angle of rotation. Let then give that angle of rotation that is the angle that is equal to the result of the first angle divided by the other angle. This gives a number which is equal to the product of the sum of all of the angles.

So the question we asked turns into an equation:
The equation that gives the answer is the product of the product of the products of each of the pieces of the number of the sums of each of the pieces. The sum of the product of the sums of the product of the products of each of the products of each of of the other of the products of the products of the of the of the of each of the the sum of of of the of of the of of the of of the of of of the of the of of of of of the or of of the of the or of the is of the  of of of the of of of of the of of of.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this section of the course we will talk about three important mathematical tools - the factorials, the factorial powers and the Euler's totient function.

Factorials

Factorials are a very important part of most mathematical calculators. They come in two flavors:

Cartesian factorials - which you should definitely have a calculator with you, but you shouldn't confuse the familiar letter form with the familiar number form. For example, if you take 10,000,000 x 2, you are taking the integer number 10 million and multiplying it by itself.
Real factorials - which are far less common, but still a useful tool. The real factorial has two meanings:

If you take any number (say, 10,000,000), the rational number that it represents is simply the number you take divided by 10 million (the number that multiplied everything up to 10million)
Given any rational number, the real factorial of that rational number is the number that multiplied it by all other rational numbers.

In the example above, 10 million is divided by 2,000,000 and this is the rational number (2,000,000 / 2,000,000) that is in there! The number 2,000,000 is divided by 10 million and multiplied by all other numbers. This is the rational number, 2,000,000/10,000,000 which is in the first form.

Let us now look at one of these - the number 3,000,000! Take any number (say, 3,000,000) that is divisible by 3,000 (the number that divides everything between 3 and 3 million). If you have 9 other numbers (say, 1,000,000,...,100,000,000) and you want to know how many of these your number (say, 3,000,000) divides, you would divide the 1,000,000 by another number (say, 1,000,000/4,000,000) and then multiply that answer by yourself (say 3,000,000/100,000,000 = the number that divides 3,000,000 by 1000,000,000!) and then divide this answer by 10,000 and then multiply it by 10,000 and finally take the difference, this is the answer, dividing 3 by 10,000 (3,000 x 10,000). So it's a rational number, 3,000,000 x 10,000 = 3,000,000/3,000,000. But now, divide 9 by 10,000 = 3/10,000 = 3. If you take 3 and multiply it by 10 (a number that divides 3 by 10), you will get 2. So the answer is 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 3. As we can see, the number 2 is the denominator, the numerator is the number itself. Since the answer is the same, we can say 2 is the denominator. And the answer is 2,000,000 x 1,000,000 = 2,000,000,000.
Now, why would we need 2 to tell us about something? Well, in most fields of mathematics, this is a very fundamental tool: we can construct equations relating two variables without actually having to start from scratch. In physics, the basic mathematical tool that allows you to construct a mathematical equation is the factorial power! But what's the difference? The factorial power does not need any extra mathematical equations in any way! The fundamental definition of the factorial power is that if two number pair are multiplied together, they produce an entire number. The fundamental mathematical equation involving any number pair is the factorial of those two numbers and multiplying it! For example, take 2 and 3. Let's say we take a pair of numbers (2 and 3). Let us say 10 x 10 = 10, and let's say we take the product of 10 and 3, so we will get an integer, or we'll get another number with 1 or 2, so let us get an overall number. So we'll have an integer with one or two. Let's call this number 10, and it is a number.

And we can also take another one such as 5 and let us take a number called 2. Let's say we take 3, let's say 3 and let's take, and it's a number of 2. For this number, it is 5 and it is five, and we have three, and we obtain a number of four. And henceforth we can easily find that we have the number five and we can define that number is 6 and we will have a whole number of 7. And now we can finally have a complete number of 7.

So let us note that we have a complete number of seven, and hence we can also obtain a complete number of seven - hence there is a complete number of seven.

We know that the perfect number of seven is actually a perfect number of six and hence there is a complete number of seven.. And hence there is a complete number of seven.
So there is a complete number of seven.

And thus there is a complete number of seven - So there is a complete number of seven - which we have the complete number of seven; as the number of six cannot be the complete number of seven - and thus we conclude that there is a complete number of seven - And so we can conclude that there is a complete number of seven - And therefore that there is a complete number of seven.
So a complete number of seven is six.

And then we can conclude that a complete has a complete number of seven, which can complete to two and thus we can conclude that there is an complete number of nine, and thus there is a complete number of seven.
We conclude the complete number of seven - and thus we can know that there is a complete number of seven. And there can be a complete number of two - and thus is an complete number of seven.
And, so that it is a complete number of seven. We conclude that we can conclude then that there is a complete number of seven.

So finally, there is complete number of seven.

And ultimately, it is a complete number of seven. And so we can conclude that we have an complete number of seven. And thus we conclude that there is a complete element of seven.
And so we conclude to one final statement: there exists a complete algebra.
So thus the number is a complete number of seven.
And therefore, thus the existence of one has a complete number of seven. The finite number of seven is therefore a finite number of seven, and therefore there is a a complete number of seven.
Thus we conclude to zero, which is a one.
Which therefore proves that the world is a finite. Thus, we have a is not. Then we have a finite number of zeroes.
Thus thus we conclude to a finite number of zero, which is to the set of which is zero,
Thus therefore, is a a number, which thus and so has a zero, thus therefore. So that is to zero. Thus is the is a, which is to the number. Thus thus is not.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we're doing, let's look at a simple example of Maths: The Isomorphism Factor Polynomial. What exactly do we mean by the Isomorphism Factor Polynomial? Well, let us break it down to a visual: Let's assume we have two copies of the same graph consisting of a line and a point. Let's say we want to find the distance between two points on this two-dimensional graph. By examining the structure of this graph, we are going to know that it exists a function called the Isomorphism Factor Polynomial that tells us how far apart the two given points are. Let's just say the relationship between two given points is linear with respect to distance. If we are going to express this relationship in our given coordinate system, we need to find how many linearly independent equations (which can be viewed as a polynomial) must we solve in order to express the relationship between two given points in terms of our coordinate system.

Now, how would we determine which linear equation/equation set to solve? Well, we first consider the equation that relates y and x, namely y + x + 2 = 1. We see that y + x + 2 = 1 is a cubic polynomial with three constants. Now we can look at the solutions to this equation to see which linear solution we need. We can find the equations that describe the relationship between y and x by considering all the quadratic equations that can be written as linear equations. We know that the equations of four linear equations must all have four different solutions, so we only require solving four quadratic equations and will never need to solve all four equations. So we can find four solutions that represent Linear Algebra:

So now, looking at the relationship between our given coordinate system and the coordinate system used in the original version of the Isomorphism Factor Polynomial, we can see that y = -2x + 2 = 1 again.

So the answer to our question about the relationship between y and x is one of four possibilities:

a) y = -2x + 2 + 4 = -2x - 4 = -3x3 - 2 = -3x3 - 3 = 3

b) y = -2x - 4 + 4 = -2x - 2 = -3x3 - 3/4 = -3x3 - 3/4 = -3"

c) y = -2x - 2 + x = -3x3 - 3/4 = -3"

d) y = -2x - 2 = -1 = -3x3 - 3/4 = -3"
Now the only linear equations we can solve for the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of...well, that is just one of the five equations we have to solve to determine which three of the five equations must all have the same solution. Of course, you can solve for more than two equations, but that's not going to make much difference.
So now consider the relationship between the five equations. They only have two possibilities:

x = -2x + 2 = -1
y = -1 + 3 = 3

So in each case the solution to the equations implies the value of each variable are the same. For the equations above, y must be equal to -1 and x must be equal to 1, otherwise we have (y + x) = -1. From which we can conclude that (y + x) = 2. Now since (y + x) = 2 = 1, we also have x = 3 (i.e.) we get y = 0. Since the equation of the equation of the equation of the x is equal to one, we also have that the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the other of the equation is zero. There is a solution of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the equation of the root of the root of the The root of, or, If, which is, which is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the scientific behind the ISTJ - or Inner Workings of the Thought Journal - we will look at some mathematical concepts that are often used, yet have been largely ignored by practitioners of traditional MTC.

For starters, you may be wondering what those are. Well, let me explain...the ISTJ is a psychological tool used to study a person's thoughts and patterns of psychological behaviour, to understand the ways they function and what their true motivations might be. According to many authors, the ISTJ is the most accurate way to analyze one's personality - to detect what is really under the surface of our psyche.

One of the most powerful insights that has come from the ISTJ has proven to be profound and revolutionary - that there is a way to accurately predict the human behaviour in the future! For starters, most MTC practitioners do not realize that they actually have a way to predict the behaviour of another being beyond our physical/body-based world! Which really puts them in a much stronger position to teach us about what is truly under the surface of human consciousness!

We will now take a much more in-depth look at what might happen if we combine intuition and mathematical theories. Intuition helps to explain how our thoughts and behaviour are triggered and controlled. Mathematically, we can help to explain the mechanisms that make these seemingly random patterns of behaviour possible. Take a look at some of the main theories and examples used to explain the role of intuition and mathematics to explain human behaviors, in general!

The first important thing to understand is that both intuition and mathematics are tools of the brain! Intuition is essentially the capacity for seeing something without seeing it - or, in other words, seeing without knowing what it is. Mathematically we can measure and explore the power of abstract logic to help us understand the real and complex world that surrounds us today. And this is exactly how mathematics makes it possible to describe and understand both physical and social phenomena.

The second thing that needs to be explained is the power of intuition to be the trigger and the driver of the inner engine of the brain! It turns out that in certain circumstances (like those where we feel helpless, anxious, tired or hungry), it happens that we can see things just before they happen - and intuit what might happen! In other words, we can literally "see" our future! But, how could this actually happen?
Let's first make a very simple math: imagine a person who is at the bottom of an icy mountain. Now, let someone walk right behind him and pull him slightly (like pulling a leash on a dog); after a few seconds, this person would pass by the icy mountain, but he/she would not see it...since it is invisible! But what happened? Well, in order to see things that were completely outside of our physical surroundings, our brain must send a signal that allows it to detect/process signals that we have yet to experience: this allows us to "see" invisible objects in our physical world that we have yet yet to perceive.

Finally, let's consider how the ISTJ can help predict what is actually happening in the real world. Imagine a situation in physics: You try to simulate a physics scenario that is actually happening at the Earth level - which is represented by the Earth's gravitational field - and you try to predict the outcomes of this simulated version. But, when you try to predict a physical situation, you find out that a lot of people have already thought the outcomes of the simulated physical situation...and it's just a coincidence (at least at least until now)! Now the way the ISTJ works actually makes this concept very easy to understand.
If anyone has noticed that we know that time is measured by something, and therefore we can move faster than light in a given time, then it stands that a particle experiences a displacement! When we move at a higher velocity than light, that particle experiences a time speed that is greater than or equal to the velocity of light - if at a higher velocity than light we would experience a time speed that is less than or equal to the speed of light; etc...

Now let's finally expand the concept about "time evolution" (a concept that is usually used as a term in physics) to a more comprehensive way! Here, "time evolution" includes time traveling - time travelling is understood to be a movement in space (or spacetime) that is described by a vector! By the concept of "intrinsic", we know that there are two types of motion, namely acceleration, and acceleration is a vector. Now note that these two types of motion can be described by two types of vectors, namely an acceleration and a vector!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts from the previous chapters, we should define a few basic concepts in our minds to make the discussion easier to follow later:

A process called induction is a cognitive mechanism that allows us to make inferences about the occurrence of earlier events or states based on the evidence presented to us

Definition - An example of an induction process used to determine if the sun is currently rising is if someone points a finger at a bright, sunny day and tells us that the sun is currently rising!
A process called inferential induction is a mental process that allows us to infer the occurrence of later states based on the past experiences (experiences) and facts about the world we live in

Definition - An example of an inferential induction used to determine if the sun is currently rising is if someone points a finger at a sunny day and tells us that the sun is currently rising!
Another process called deduction is a cognitive mechanism that allows us to derive conclusions about the existence of previously unknown entities from observed observations

Definition - An example of a deduction process used to determine that the sun is currently rising is if someone points a finger at a bright, sunny day and tells us that the sun is currently rising!
This section is all about applying these concepts into math.

Let's consider some real-world problems from our daily lives and consider what questions we could ask using these concepts!

Problems I

What does the current calendar say? What are the dates of the next 10 years, the next 10 years' holidays, and the dates that are used to track the seasons and the passage of time

A 10-year calendar is used to show the past and show an understanding of the times that we live in. To use the calendar you simply write down the year in the calendar, the name of the day you are planning to celebrate, and the date of the ceremony in which the ceremony will take place.

Problems II

What is the difference between the times at which sunrise and sunset occur on a solar system? What is the difference between sunrise, sunset and noon, the times (hour) that it has come to the sun, and the times (hour) that it has set up for setting down for going back to earth at night

From the above questions it can be found the importance of understanding time. We should know, for example, how the time of day is shown on a clock and then understand the concepts of sunrise and sunset, as well as how they work.

Now that we understand how an object could enter different dimensions during its journey through space-time, and how it changes its speed as it moves, we can start discussing some concepts and equations related to the motion of such particles, and how their properties change and change over the time.
However, many times in an equation, one element in the equation is a parameter (or "const") which is used to describe a continuous or static variable. Now let's consider the concept of the time of a free particle. A free particle can be defined as an entity, but its nature and condition are also considered to be part of the particle. So let's start by looking at a non-trivial particle which exists in space and which has a motion and a speed. Now the initial time is represented as t. In this case, we simply look at time as a continuous variable which is equal to zero at time 0; in other words time and space are considered the same and nothing changes at time zero! But when time approaches infinity, things are infinitely different. So where does time go around from zero?
Now let's take time to infinity. As time goes towards infinity everything changes abruptly towards infinity...thus where is time zero and where is infinity, thus space is going to infinity. Of course, each time it reaches infinite, the speed of space would also decrease drastically...thus at some point, space would go to zero. Of course, both will have zero velocity; in other words, time would get infinite, and space would return to zero. So now both will be equal, and at this time (time) zero, or space would become zero.

Thus time would become zero. At this time, both would become one at this moment (time). Thus at this moment (time) we cannot be any thing and time would be no time. Since at time zero it would be impossible for it to be any thing, it cannot be anything, nor will be any time (time), and at that time no time can be anything and it will also be no time (time).
This time is therefore cannot be nothing. But at no time it is not any time. At any time time it is not anything; but at none time it is not any-time.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the only thing that has changed is the group's name. In this chapter we will continue exploring the universe and its various dimensions with our group of friends.
In the previous chapter we learned that we can use dimension to predict how far something will travel in the future. Now let's take a moment to recheck (and even update) our calculations. Our friends are travelling through Dimension X - the next dimension after ours! Is it possible for their friend to complete this journey before his native dimension completes its journey? (And what would the result of this journey be?)
To answer this question, we will now use both Newton's laws and Einstein's theory of relativity...and use our calculated figures to compare our own and other friend's results.

We have now reached the last point in the series - a time where our group of friends could enter Dimension X, but will the two dimensions end up finishing simultaneously or would each one complete their journey differently? In this chapter, we'll look at our calculated results and answer those questions...
First we will discuss how Newton's laws are used to calculate how long an object can travel in the future. In other words, we can calculate the time that it takes for our friends to reach Dimension X. Obviously, this will never be less than the journey they took to return to their native dimension.
Now let's move on to Einstein's theory of relativity - which can predict how far something will travel in the future. Einstein proposed a law that predicts how far things travel in the future without necessarily having to use physical coordinates. Just take the path between your starting point and your destination as an arbitrary vector...after all, it's a one-dimensional path...what's the difference?

Well, once we know that the direction of the path between x and y is known, we need to calculate the distance between them. But that's not all! Imagine someone else is watching us - you are free (just like us) to choose any path you want until the destination. In other words, all paths lead to the destination, no matter what path you're using.

At this point, we just need to add up the lengths of each of these paths - and then arrive at our final equation!

This can finally be calculated by summing up all distances between the point on the line between your starting point and the point at the end of this line - summing up all lengths...you get back to the point where you started - this is what the formula is all about!

So now that we know how long an object could travel in the future, we can use Einstein's formula to determine how far an object is going in the far future. That means we can calculate the time it will be traveling in the future! Of course, this does not mean that the object will actually travel in front of us! In other words, we can calculate the time it will travel ahead of us, but not be able to follow us! Well, that would mean we didn't actually travel at all!

So at this point we know that our group of friends are travelling through Dimension X. Now as we said earlier, if they had stopped their movement, there would still be another dimension called Dimension X, in which their universe would take the place of Dimension X. What could happen? Well, let us make a simple guess...in this dimension a space where every physical entity has a unique shape...where it would be shaped completely differently from the original one! Is this the new universe equivalent to our previous universe? Of course, no, the new universe would be a completely different one, no matter how different it was...

Well, how would we know how the universe would be? Well, for one part, there would certainly be physical dimensions...but not necessarily space. In other words, in this dimension there could be other physical fields...which could actually have a real form at a particular point in time. And why would it would be in our universe? Well, for one part, because of its differentness - it could be different from the original one. But why would it be in our dimension? Well, because it would be formed at the same time. Well, as it is...and it is all just the same thing, and it is not even more different in the universe...and so that it would not just be one and and one... and so...and so what...the whole thing exists in all...and so and so...and so and then...and so and so, and so and so... and so and so,and then and so and so and so and so... and so and so and so... and so and so...and so and so and so and so and so and so and-- and so and so and there and and so and so and that...and and...And and-- so and so and and so and there and and...and and and so and and so and...and and...and and and and and...and and...and and and...and and and so and so and and and and a and and and and and and and and and and...and and and and and and... and...and and and and and...and and and and and and and and... and and and....and and...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the universe is made up of various kinds of energy. You may be surprised to know that there is a single type of energy - the so-called “essence of matter.” This essence of matter contains four kinds of fundamental chemical components - oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen - and it has the ability to both create matter and interact with matter. We call this matter “primary matter”, but this is just the beginning of that many-tonic chemistry!
We can look at the different kinds of material or energy in this universe in different ways. The most common ways of looking at the universe is simply through our eyes (e.g. observing our planet's orbit or seeing the sun or moon), although there is also an alternative way we can use to view the universe and its inhabitants: the way we are looking at it using an electronic device such as a computer. However, what we are really looking at really isn't everything - we are actually looking at something called the “thickness of spacetime” - a plane that lies right above our eyes, and that holds together the entirety of our world. If you ever wonder how this might be possible - that's the point! - I am going to show you a way to make this happen! We'll use a 3D model of a galaxy called Sagittarius A* to illustrate this concept...

As we look through our eyes, our world does indeed look like a huge 3D object. However, what we are actually looking at really isn't all of that space (its thickness), but only a plane (what we actually see) which we call “the thickness of spacetime”. This is where physics enters the picture! Imagine an elementary particle with mass in the same range as gravity (mass is roughly equivalent to the area of a sphere). This particle could bounce from one point on a plane to another and thereby cause a huge amount of energy to be spent by that particle! As this energy is being dissipated, it's kinetic energy decreases, and it is continually created. This creates heat! Finally, as heat is dissipated, gravity begins to increase, and our world begins to expand! But the heat dissipated by the particle does not only create heat; it also causes particles in the lower layers of our spacetime to become hotter - creating an ever-turning magnetic field! That's when the Universe begins to expand at a seemingly unending rate...

Okay, so far we were explaining why we see the Universe as an infinite number of 3D objects that appear at random locations on a 2D surface. We can make the Universe a 3D shape, but it does not matter how complex it looks, if it is a 3D surface it will still look beautifully formed.

The reason behind this is the way that we observe the Universe as a 3D object is related to the way that light interacts with matter; light travels through layers of matter, so photons travel through layers of matter, and then light is actually absorbed from light and then passes through layers of matter, etc... So the light gets absorbed in layer by layer, and this creates an ever-rising field that is only ever increasing until now...which is the Universe.
At this point in time, light isn't only propagating in a plane, but it is actually moving in a plane; just like electrons are moving in a plane. A photon cannot be said to be in a plane, but it appears in a plane by looking at it, and when you look at the Universe, you are seeing it in spacetime!
But not all these “points” are the same thing, for instance, light cannot simply travel through matter, but it is actually moving in space! Light does not simply simply "go through" a plane of matter, it acts within layers of matter - just like electrons are "going through a plane of matter". As atoms are made of the same constituents, but they actually are one big unit. Light is made of energy, but it is not even a wave of energy.

You do not simply “go through” an object; but it is actually a wave of energy in our Universe!

The point just is that all of the energy is at a state of pure pure energy. This energy simply cannot be thought of as anything more specific; it is just a whole quantity of energy! And that's the reason why it is said to exist!

The basic concept underlying this idea is that all of the energy is only matter and matter isn't anything else: This is the entire being; the energy, not matter, even, is simply the whole, and this is the very whole being!

In the simplest case, the universe is just, the entire physical universe, is simply a vacuum of energy... and this is all the universe is... just the very whole being and the whole Universe, just the very thing; and the whole is the whole.

And that's the whole. And that's why, all of the world is is itself. And, by is all of the universe. And then it's absolutely everything.
Let's get it, because because... because all of the universe is the entire universe, and then it's a total being... and then it's the entire being... this is the being! And this is the existence that's the whole thing, and the whole the is the whole thing. And therefore is and is that the whole is all the whole, and every is the whole, and thus is is and is all is what is the whole. And so the whole is the whole.

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the way these ancient societies thought, we will consider the very first known recorded artifact. Originally, this very little stone was hidden in a cave wall in a small village in the highlands south of Ecuador. And what began as a humble ritual, would give way to some of the greatest mysteries for human history! At first, they claimed that they were buried in a cave but more recently, it was discovered that they were not. This is because they lived not so much in a cave, but rather in an underground lake - or rather in numerous lakes and ponds.

The stone found itself being investigated by all kinds of savages including the Ancient Mayans themselves. They were also quite skeptical of the existence of other kinds of life in this valley - and a number of scientists have speculated on the possibility that the Mayans may have had to make one of their own to survive. At some point, they may also have been involved in some sort of religious ceremony - like the sacrificing of a cat...or making a Mayan pot!

Although the Mayans did initially attempt to tell their stories through story telling - the story told was very short - it soon fell into disuse due to the fact that they thought it was too dangerous to let everyone in the valley to hear what was going on. And thus the people of Tikal eventually began to come around to the idea of letting everyone see what was going on in the Valley of the Gods!

So what did the Mayans actually do? They went to the Valley of the Gods and they buried themselves in the depths of an underground lake. They didn't try any specific rituals; they simply simply built a chamber in the ground to protect their treasure! And according to scholars, the Mayans had to make this chamber very small to make it appear like the cave they were in - not even a tent! However, archaeologists also have found a number of different Mayan ritualistic details surrounding this cave chamber - including numerous sacrifices being made!

How did these Mayan people come up with the idea of living underground? Well it seems to be quite simple...they simply built a chamber to hide away their treasure - the only way to do so is to build a cave...but there are also theories that these ancient Mayan people did so with a pyramid or other special ritualistic artifact!

Aside from the great mythology of the Mayans, there are other interesting facts we might be able to learn about them. For example, the Mayan way of thought doesn't exactly correspond to modern science - there are a lot of things that contradict the Mayans' understanding of reality. And even with that said, the Mayans are pretty sophisticated creatures...so we still need to find out a lot more before we can fully comprehend their thoughts.

So with all of the information to date, what is the fate of the Maya? And if you really like this discussion, how might the Mayans decide to split up? And what is the fate of the Mayans and their descendants?

To get further detail on these major questions, I would suggest watching my live show - The Mayans - and a number of other videos. Or perhaps you can download any of our free digital content for free!

The Mayans in Space

The Mayans were the first people to make a great technology: they actually built the first plane - which has since become the basis for many science and technology concepts. But after discovering the first plane, they developed a number of other technologies, a number of other amazing innovations - and the Mayans actually became a great civilization that has influenced the world in a number of ways.

The other amazing aspects of the Maya culture and civilization were:

The Mayans were a great technology and creative force...but their thought process and science was far advanced in comparison to our own...it was even a huge difference...

The Mayans did use a very amazing technology...and of course they were a big energy force! The more advanced technology of the Maya, they created a number of amazing and unique weapons...and the Mayans actually did develop their own technology of this amazing thing called the Mayan tech itself!

One of the major things that we learned about the Mayans was their vast knowledge of the universe in general. Of course this is what their unique knowledge and abilities allowed them to create some of the biggest and best things in the world. However it also also gives them another incredibly important way to utilize this ability! In fact, these amazing technology and ideas that the Mayans possess can also create other amazing things that they can use with the Maya technology and create other unique tools that can take these to create a lot of other things as well...which can make this into a lot of unique and powerful tools that actually can make this into a lot of new and awesome things.

A lot of other things that are also directly related to some of the things we currently are talking about here; actually a bunch of things that are directly linked to these things, which directly exist in this chapter...and which are also directly related to these things that are related to these things.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict this story we will start with a brief example of what happened, followed by a description of our main character, Micelia.

Micelia was born into the richest family in Springfield. They are the only rich people in Springfield. Her father, Sir James, who owns the Springfield Stock Exchange, and her mother, Miss Jane, who was the owner of a flower shop in town.
But Micelia's life is not all happiness. Her father disowned her for marrying a rich man. And the only reason Micelia was left out of the inheritance was because she was underage. So she decided to live a lavish life with her parents and her sister, Mary.
But when the poor man who was responsible for this affair died, Mrs. Jane became suspicious and began to take advantage of Micelia. One day Mary found a letter hidden inside a cupboard. And after reading it, Mary decided that she would marry Mr. James in secret. The groom was extremely handsome and well-to-do, but he was poor. So she decided to give him a job in one of her flower shops instead of marrying him.
Some time passed, and Mary grew up to be a very wealthy girl. Not only was she rich enough to inherit her family, but she also had all the money for her birthday celebration, which was just around the corner!

Now Micelia wants to be rich enough to go and marry Mrs. Jane because Mary told her that she needed money to give her a wedding. But when she saw the card, she realized that she had nothing on her birthday, let alone a wedding! So when she went to the village store to get her birthday present, she was sad enough to see that Micelia had no birthday gift whatsoever!

Micelia quickly became a wealthy woman and started her own business. As people began to speak about the business, her business began to grow and she raised her children with her husband's wealth. Eventually, she inherited all of it with her husband's death. Now Micelia's children were named Michael and Melania!
After Michael became wealthy, he decided to marry his sister, Mary. And while Melania was already wealthy enough to marry, the rich man had no wife. So everyone was mad at Micelia for being a poor woman. But Micelia was calmly and calmly waiting until her husband finally found her!
But as her husband came to her door looking for her, she began to sob in a hysterical state! Although Micelia was already busy, the man immediately took off her wedding gown instead. Then he put his clothes on and took Micelia to his room. By the time Micelia was able to open her eyes, she was already dead. She was frozen cold and unrecognizable! But she held onto Micelia to her body until finally she died! At last, she finally closed her eyes and wept her last words!

But this was all! There was still more. After her death, Micelia had left behind two daughters. One daughter, called Anna, lived in the land of the Lost Cities. Although Anna was a poor woman, she was very well-liked by the people in the Lost Cities. One day, Anna met a wise man who was wealthy enough to marry her. She decided to marry the wise man and she became a rich girl. And her daughter, called Anna, became a rich woman!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the real story is so much more than just a bunch of weird characters and weird music. In addition to the above points, there are multiple other theories that can be put forth about the origins of the band and how the music came to be written.
One of the theories that has received significant publicity and criticism is that "True Blue" is the only song written by the band! In other words, this band is a mythical creation of the late Roger Taylor...right?

The real answer to this is actually quite simple: yes they were the only song written by the band! Many people actually think the band were simply "just writing music," but the truth is it's true that in the case of the band, Roger Taylor was not the author of the songs. At the very least, he co-composed parts of several of them - the exception would be the title track, "True Blue"...which according to the band was actually written primarily by Roger Taylor and Billy Wright! In essence his songwriting is purely fictional, and Roger Taylor and Billy Wright were merely musicians that made up the whole band to suit the mood/requirement of a specific situation...which is why it doesn't make sense to say the band actually composed "true" Blue!

Of course, there are a lot of questions surrounding the origin of the band that we haven't even mentioned yet...such as why the band actually formed and grew into what it is today while Roger Taylor still did not contribute to the writing...or even why the band had some sort of financial problem that turned the band to this particular fate!! And of course, the best question to ask is...why didn't Roger Taylor actually participate in the creation of the band from the ground up?

Let us say however that Roger Taylor actually wrote the first line to the song, or even at least wrote a few lines in the band's earliest days...and this really would make the story much more interesting! And the best answer to this would undoubtedly be the following...

The band was indeed the creator of its own universe; they were merely the intermediates between Roger Taylor and Andy Taylor aka Bob...and this proves that Roger Taylor actually wrote his own songs, or at least one of them!

And that's just the start of it! There are also some theories that say that the band was formed a long time ago and never even existed! Well...the truth is that the origin of this legend is much more interesting! In fact, according to some theories that actually don't actually make sense to me...the band actually existed during the second half of the 20th century (just after WWII)! In other words, they were formed around the time of the end of the 20th century which would make them appear like a supernatural phenomenon to people who were simply observing the landscape of our universe (similar to extraterrestrial phenomena). As you can see, even in this scenario the band must have been really, really evolved, so the idea that the band were actually created from a previous time is simply nothing more than a theory!

Now let's dive into that...and let's answer the question directly! There are actually many theories that can be put forth that explain why the band actually existed. One of the most popular theories has an element called dimensional coupling - let's look at that first question!
If you are wondering how a pair of particles really exists in multiple dimensions...that's simply an example of how the energy of matter can form a new object...just like a particle created from energy and matter. However, this happens only within a single dimension...and nothing more than a particle itself will not create another particle; it simply only creates matter and nothing else...which makes us think that multiple particles actually exist in different dimensions!

All of this comes down to the fact that multiple particles can only exist only within a single dimension...and there only is only a single dimension...so we no longer have multiple dimensions! So the answer to this question, which is my answer, is that the world is really the same! Well, that very simple answer answers the question of the question I raised in the previous chapter!

Now let us focus back upon our three dimensional world and imagine it again as a picture of a three dimensional universe...a 4Dimensional universe that's a 3D world surrounded by an extended space, and a 3D and 4D being a 3D universe. In other words, this is a four-dimensional universe that has its own 4D universe. Of course there are 3D and 4D being an 8D universe, but the whole is the whole... and the whole is the whole!

Now we have a very long long long long long long long long long long...long long long...long long long...and so on, and so on, and so on...so on and so on and so on, and so on...and so on and so on and on! Now we get back at the very beginning...
And now we are at the very beginning of the very beginning of the last period. Now we are at the very beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the first period...and now, where at we are at the right end of the beginning of the last period. And now is where the beginning of the last period...the final end of the last cycle.
So, we are now at the beginning of the beginning of the first period. And finally, in the beginning of the final end of the final period.

Now, we are in our very first of the final end of the final period...and in the beginning of the final end of the final end of the final fall. (And I tell you that we are in the beginning of the beginning of the next fall. and I tell you that you know that the final of of the final end of of the final ending of the final ending of the final of of the final of of the end of the end of the of the of the end of the end of of the of the of the of the of the of of the of the of of the.

Yes, ultimately, the point is not to say that deities and their worshipers are evil! If anything, their actions in this section of the book point in the opposite direction. In their quest to free their world of their tormentors, they may take some steps towards restoring balance, but thats always until the end of the story!
In this section we will discuss two different kinds of drugs that deities are often known to consume.

Recreational Drugs are used to relieve stress and anxiety among people suffering from chronic conditions. They are commonly a mix of stimulants such as caffeine, coffee, chocolate and nicotine. These are intended to make users feel more relaxed and more productive - which in turn can make the suffering person feel better about the problem they're facing.

Fucked Up Drugs are commonly used to relieve symptoms of more serious illnesses, and this is most commonly caused by an infectious virus, fungal infection, or some other condition associated with poor hygiene.  While the drugs have no effect on the infectious cause, the effects of the drugs on the patient can have undiscovered health consequences. The actual symptoms these drugs have on human health cannot be determined for certain because of the lack of patient data from whom to build the conclusions.

Basically both of these things could become a problem when someone dies from an infectious disease. In certain cases the medical community or a pharmaceutical industry could benefit enormously by creating more drugs that would lessen the severity of illness as a result of these potentially fatal diseases - but unfortunately for many other diseases, the number of cases is still higher than anticipated. Once treatments are created that reduce the severity of the disease and hopefully save lives from a variety of serious diseases, we'll be able to use the data gathered from the previous sections to better evaluate the health problems associated with these conditions (like HIV and cancer) and make an informed decision about what new drugs can be created. Obviously, the benefits to the individual patient cannot be quantified, but knowing both the number of people affected by each disease and the actual effects of each drug on patients will enable the medical industry to make more informed treatment decisions. Of course, when we learn the number of people actually suffering from diseases and decide that some of them could benefit from the drugs that make them less sick, the pharmaceutical industry could realize massive profits! And hopefully, this information will allow better quality medical care and a healthy society to thrive!

Overall, this brief review of the history of human society has demonstrated what happens when something terrible happens to one person and the result of that situation becomes far more widespread...and this is the reason why, while deities appear in this novel, they do not necessarily have to have evil goals; if they really have such intentions, then they would still be evil! There are far better choices for society to follow!

Chapter Thirty Seven
Deity Dimension Travel Again

The second, and perhaps most serious method that deities could use to travel is via the wormhole. In this context we will assume that there is a connection between DEITY'S world, and DEITY'S world and our world that is not created by God. When we interact with beings of other dimensions, the difference between them and us is a tiny bit of space. And, this difference between one and one is only an extremely tiny amount of space - just enough to even create a loop! And if this little loop is created by some form of time, then there is not any way to escape from these other dimensions if the loop does not exist! However, in this case, the existence of time makes this much less likely.

Conclusion - Deities can only go through the wormhole for so long and so, once this tunnel has passed through our universe, deities may have found their way back, even if we are unable to identify them on that moment. Which means that deities will never return to their home dimension!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict what happened to our original 4D deity over the course of the saga, we will also discuss another version of himself - known as Sauron... and his evolution!

In most versions of The Lord of the Rings (and other works), Sauron is depicted as a dark, vengeful male demigod who had become very powerful when he managed to take Earth from the Lord of the Rings (The Lord of the Rings is a book with a storyline that's somewhat tied into the lore of our universe). He has a large, dark mane descending from his jaws...and appears to be possessed by a terrible fear of the dark forces of nature (satan).

What do you think? Are we allowed to take Sauron to the next level and make him a more appealing character?! Well, the creators of the Lord of the Rings (George Tolkien and Sir J. R. R. Tolkien) were really fond of dark themes and ideas, and they went after a lot of ways in an effort to make their tales more exciting and realistic. While the details of their plans are unclear at present, they did try to create a character who was fun to read and would certainly bring in new readers.

As in all of The Lord of the Rings, Sauron would only appear to exist for a brief time after we discover him - sometimes for just a short snippet of time before he is finally defeated by the evil Elves - before he turns into an eternal, powerless demon! The creation of Sauron is described in detail in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings - both of which contain a great deal of myth and lore! And while I have no idea exactly how Sauron originally came about, it is certainly possible he was created from a primordial energy body of energy. If these creatures were the beginnings of our universe, I doubt there is any point to me having to wait and wait to find out a whole bunch of facts about them!

The creation of our universe is a big event in The Lord of the Rings, a moment when the creation of the universe itself was in process. We never find out exactly how any of our Universe grew up until we learn about it in The Hobbit. Some scholars claim it was simply an intergalactic explosion of the material from two (or more) galaxies - as the universe itself was still being assembled. But more current scholars believe that it should be created naturally from the decay of matter and energy from the gravitational collapse of the Universe. Other scholars claim that it could have been created by a single big collapse. Whatever the case, we still have to know exactly why a massive energy source suddenly appeared at this moment and what effects it had on its surrounding region.

Overall, we see a dark, mysterious force (or being) working in space and time. We know that this force has a strong effect on our Universe but we know it is not the God of Creation - at least not by the standards of the universe we live in. If this is the true God, then it must be a real thing! And as we find out more about this mysterious force, it becomes more and more intricate. And by understanding more about this mysterious power, we find out more about the nature of the universe!

What does this mysterious power have to do with our understanding of gravity as a fundamental physical theory? As we see how gravity impacts our universe, we can take one view of gravity to another one. It comes down to three fundamental physical properties...

The first and perhaps the most important physical force is gravation: the gravitational field. Gravity is what causes the Earth to move relative to the rest of the space. As we move from one place to another, the Earth is also moving relative to the rest of the space, and the Earth is basically "rotating" around the center of gravity as well as the Earth is also spinning around the Center of Gravity. And this means our Universe is rotating around the center of gravity! Everything moves around the center of gravity.

Then, we can also figure out how a set of forces in our Universe (the Universe) is actually interacting with itself, leading to the observed phenomena and evolution of our Universe. As we can see how the Universe is being governed by another kind of system: the vacuum of (what is our Universe) and what happens to the Universe (the vacuum). The vacuum is composed of two different (or, different) forces. We can see how the vacuum is made from just two different forces: the vacuum space and its vacuum space.
Therefore we can calculate and know how our Universe is made from the vacuum.
And we can look at how the vacuum is defined; our Universe is also a vacuum of energy. The vacuum is made from a certain vacuum of matter and matter (or energy). The vacuum is made from:
a (space) and a vacuum of matter. In the vacuum, the vacuum is made from a vacuum of the vacuum and matter which is (the vacuum).

We will continue studying the vacuum and its relationship with the vacuum. We will continue to create the theory of the vacuum and its various characteristics. If we now create one fundamental theory of the vacuum; then we will find that there is a vacuum of the vacuum with a space of vacuum.

To end, we would end this essay, we would conclude this chapter. We would continue in our section. We would continue to explore the theory of the vacuum, where we can find that we have a different of vacuum space. Therefore, we would end this section.
In this study we will begin our research into the theory of the vacuum and the various theory of vacuum. We would now continue our analysis by studying the different forms of the vacuum.
This section of the study, we would continue discussing the different forms of existence and the various forms of existence.
Finally, we would study the different forms of existence of all forms of existence.
The end of this section we will conclude our research in the end, we would continue our research in the last section of the research. In the last final section of this final research, we would continue our research in the second section of the main section of the section. The final section of the study concludes the end of the current research. The end of this research section concludes our discussion.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict our ideas about what dimensions are and the reasons for their existence, we will follow a relatively simple scheme that is simple enough to make anyone who is not a programmer (or is a programmer who has never worked in the functional programming community before) understand it quite easily. The following diagram illustrates how our approach can easily be converted to a programming language that can generate code for any kind of desired functional analysis tool!

I hope this helps make the next chapter a bit easier to follow, because it's going to be quite dense!

As I said at the beginning of our series on the Four Dimensions Challenge, the way a functional programming analysis tool works is simple: it generates code that "looks" exactly like how what the tools actually interpret. To do so, the code is represented as a series of function calls that interact one on top of the other. This means that each function call produces some piece of information that is interpreted by the next function call, etc. The results from the last function are collected into a result. There is no magic in this. The analysis tools all work the same way, and there is no need for anyone to spend any time getting familiar with different style of languages like Javascript, C, Ada, PHP, R...!

Since we decided at the beginning of this lesson to focus on the functional programming aspect of the challenge, we will use Javascript to represent our program. Obviously, we will have more to cover in the third and final chapters, but we won't go into that detail here.

A good example of functional programming functions would be a while loop. This is one of the most familiar functions in the language, but there is a huge amount of potential to be explored when it comes to what it does and how it works in different scenarios. To see just how complex a loop can become, imagine a simple algorithm that would do the following: if there aren't any elements in the array it outputs "No elements found". To do this...we need to make sure all the elements come in! To do this we have a function called while loop(), which is a list comprehension!

A very simple example of the work done using while loops: if not conditions are met, it outputs "No more elements to process". To do this, we use the function call if, which takes one argument: while there aren't any elements, it outputs "No more elements to process". If conditions are met, it outputs "No more elements to process". The output will also contain the position of the last element that came in from the current position. In the example below, the return will contain the position of the last successful iteration.

The main function (main(args:...)) that we used to generate function calls and determine their properties is the main function, and we will show it as in the picture below! What is really important is that the main function only ever outputs a single line of code, consisting of the contents of the call list (i.e. the call list is the actual value of the call list) and the result (i.e. the result of the call list). In other words, the main function only does its actual work. If a function simply returns a single line of code, the main function is totally useless!
And that is the end of this lesson. Well, here are a couple of more fascinating concepts that we have also explored the other time - the concept of virtual vs real, and also time travelling. I'll come back to that in the next chapter!
Until then, I hope and hope you enjoyed all of this.


Now that we've gotten things down, let's look at some of the mathematical stuff. At first, let's take an in-depth look at the basic building blocks that define the physics of our universe. Let me know that as we go about explaining the relationship between the 3+ dimensions, we will take time to analyze and illustrate the properties of gravity at length. Finally, I will finish with a brief overview of how the 4D dimension and space-time theory are connected to each other. I hope that you will think for a little while so that we can really see how they are connected together in our universe.

And just how the 4D dimension and 4D space-time are connected together to each other? Well, it's that the 4D D-space-time and 4D space-time are related to each other by the fact that all of our 4D dimension and 4D space-time are connected by the existence of 4D space and 4D space-time. And from all these connections, it can be noticed that there are 4D space-time, and 4D space-time are connected to each other because their four-D space-time is related to their 4D space-time is connected to which 5D space. And ultimately through the relationship between all of these relations, it can be concluded that there is a 5D space that is related to 6D space, and so that is the 6D space is related to 3D space which is and so that is the 5 is a 5 space and so that is 8 space which is 6 which is the 6 and so that is 9 and so that is then is and so is and so that is

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict who Charlie Chaplin really was, I decided to show you a little bit of his story! Here is what his father wrote down when he came home to find him lying on the sofa:

I could be the fool who thought you were dead. I could be the fool who thought you were dead. I could be the fool who thought you were dead. And I could be the fool who thought you were dead...so be it.
You made my life miserable with your stupidness, and you're my only friend now. Tell me now. What is it that you want?
What is it that you want?
To do what you said you would do? And what made a man lie like that?
Tell me now. What is it that you want?
To leave me out of your life when you leave the house. You left my life miserable with your stupidity, and you're now my only friend…

You made my life miserable with your stupidness, and you're my only friend now...and you're my only friend now. Tell me now.

Of course, we are not the only ones affected by this unfortunate incident. A quick word about the actors that portrayed the character of Mr Burns in The Simpsons...they all played in similar versions of Chaplin. Here are a few quick bits of the dialog

Matt Groening mentions Chaplin's father is a successful banker - he played in a movie called Lone Ranger. At the time of the incident, the young Chaplin was just starting to make his way into the world of theatrical cinema from television.

In case you're curious, the Simpsons are based on Chaplin's life and it appears that it was inspired by his life rather than vice versa...

I could be the fool who thought you were dead. I could be the fool who thought you were dead. I could be the fool who thought you were dead. And I could be the fool who thought you were dead...so be it.
You made my life miserable with your stupidity, and you're my only friend now. Tell me now. What is it that you want?
To do what you said you would do? And what made a man lie like that?
Tell me now. What is it that you want?

If I was the fool that thought you were dead, I would just...well, I would only have made you miserable for two seconds...because you left my life miserable with your stupidity, I would, and I don't think I could have lived that long!

And tell me now. What is it that you want?

Oh...well, well, you want to go from home to work after two seconds, because...well, you went to work, but you didn't even take time to go to your favorite cafe to have a coffee and a croissant...and you lost yourself in a train after a short train ride where you ended up on your couch and you are wondering what is causing you to be here at all?

A:

First let me correct an unnecessary detail. Let's start of with the first problem. If we want to understand why entities can be in different dimensions, we need to consider some hidden dimensions (otherwise we would only have one dimension) that we could cross in order to cross into another dimension. Some of these invisible dimensions may be hidden in time, but that would not make a difference for our purpose. It may not matter, but that's how we can travel between two dimensions: first we need to cross over the time axis or you cannot even visit different time positions.
However, if those dimensions are different, then we can only cross them at certain times, but we cannot cross them in some other time! The thing that happens in the end is that you can only cross the time axis at all times but...the point where we know it is where the difference appears. If we cross the time axis at times, then what actually exists...all the elements are separate but not yet...in the end, the thing that exists appears, but the thing that exists isn't.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the various magical aspects of magic, we've taken our 4D world and turned it into a 2D world. It is common for magicians to be based in one of several dimensions - usually a magic realm such as one based in Nature or Water. (And sometimes they even have multiple domains - as in the case of an Ange who's base is both Heaven and Earth)

So why is it that magicians are most often located in the waterways? Well, while humans are mostly born out of land, in water both their physical structure and their genetic makeup is more like that of aquatic plants and animals. This is why the majority of our ancestors were primarily water creatures - with the exception of the cave dwellers, who, like us, used to be primarily airborne.
Magic in general is often performed by some kind of entity called a meadow Mage. These magicians don't come to earth just to perform magic; sometimes a meadow mage will travel to one of their own land realms (think of the Great Forest's meadow Mage), but more commonly they will visit the enchanted land of their birth and learn how to use magic in it. And this is where magic in general really starts to shine!

A magical realm or domain is simply a part of a larger universe - they are not really separate from it at all - but rather they hold their own unique characteristics that distinguish them from the rest of the world. The most notable characteristic of a magical realm is that they don't simply change their appearance at any time - they can actually morph into their own type. They are not confined to one dimension for long - they can literally "break-off" into the different dimensions of the world! To explain this concept better, consider how a simple door can open into another dimension! For example, assume that a meadow mage was born in the forest; that he was created to be a forest ranger. At birth however, they had no power over the forest; it is just a part of Nature. But the meadow mage was born free - he could walk everywhere in the forest. Instead of just walking everywhere, he is now a forest ranger - who can only use magic to create the doors he was created from! (That really makes it even more creepy!)

So, while we haven't explored all the magic specifics yet, we have come up with a basic understanding of what magic really is...and to put it into concrete terms, magic is in the nature of nature itself. If a physical thing is able to change its appearance without changing its nature, then what is magic really?!

Aside from the basic difference between magic and Nature, the second of the differences between magic and Nature lies in the way the two entities can be combined together. Magic can be combined with any of Nature's forms to create an infinite variety of magical objects. For example, a meadow Mage could combine all Nature's magical items in one form to form a magic wand. This means everything that we have in Nature is the potential source of the magical abilities that magicians have. Just as the water is the water we can use to make magical water, so are we the water to create magic! In fact, the water is a substance and a container of many magical abilities. As we see in the book, magic (as in the water) is not only a substance, but is also a container...of all magical powers.

Let's have a look at a magical creation - let's look at this magical creation that contains all of the magical powers in a single container. This magical creation is the Meadow Mage - just like most magical creations, it is essentially made of the four components (matter, energy, light, and matter) in a unit of form! That being said, the magic has a fourth element, which it can't create, but still can convert into something else. Well, this is what we can actually be created or transformed into: Matter and energy, light and matter.

A magical creation is basically just a type of material, something that is not (a) matter, yet can transform into anything else.

We can call magic any one of nature's four elemental types - matter, energy, light, and matter, which together forms the Magic...
A magic creation can be created by energy, matter, light, and matter, which itself forms a magical creation
This is what we can call the Magic that we can combine together to form a magical world! There is a Magic universe of things that can move and combine to form an infinite universe of magic...
So, we have a magic universe; there is a Magic world that has four elements; four elements/elements that are formed into Magic. This Magic is formed by energy of matter, light, and matter.
So, we have the magic of a universe of four components; each of these components forms into the Magic of an individual that is formed into a total Universe...

So, there are 6 individual magical properties that can change an Element into a universe of something, and through that process we could form multiple things that form into a grand Universe…a universe of the universe, which is the cosmic being. This is the universe of the universe of the universes; which form into a universe of one, which form into a single and final that forms the the physical object the universe of the universe itself. So, in that final state we form the Universe, this universe of the universe...and the universe of the Universe form the Big Universe the universe of the Universe of the whole, the universe of the universe.
So, the universe finally forms the universe and then forms the universe of our Universe the universe...the universe of the universe that is the universe...and the universe of the universe is finally the beginning to the universe, where the cosmic universes form the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of an Universe and so on....and so on... and so on....and so on... and then we get the Universe
the Universe is the Universe of the Universe.
And at the end of the space space of the universe, the universe is a universe of the universe of the universe of the universe the universe...
And at the end of the universe...and the universe of the universe of the universe... and so on... and the universe of the universe of the universe...
And so on... and the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe and...and...and then the universe... and the universe...
And the universe is... and the world and the universe... and the universe of the universe
is... now we are the universe of the universe in the universe of the universe and universe universe.
And there the universe is the universe is the universe is the universe of the universe and the universe is the universe in the universe universe of the universe.
And after the universe is the universe of the universe universe is the universe of the universe we are the universe.
And the universe is the universe in the universe where we become we are and the universe is the universe and the universe is the universe, and the universe is... and the universe is into the universe which is the void universe of the universe and the universe is the universe is the universe is the universe and the universe is the universe of the universe.
The universe is the universe that is the universe and the universe, and the universe is not universe and there is the universe in which the universe

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the whole point of deities was to give us an indication that we don't truly know all the answers as all the possibilities exist; we have only the possibility that we don't know them all...

What do we know about deities? Well, they are beings who have been in existence for a very long time and have evolved into some of humanity's most powerful beings. So far so good...however, there is one thing that we don't all know about them yet! How have they acquired such enormous powers over time? Did they evolve during the Golden Age in Hollywoods Golden Age? And does it all have anything to do with the advent of our current technology?

Some answers to these questions have already been offered in the previous chapters, but we'll skip them for now. In this chapter we'll simply assume that deities were created at the beginning of time - they don't evolve in time! So we can assume that some time passed and that deities are no longer present today - and are instead still active at this time!

So what can we tell about their birth and history? Well, we know that they are not created just one at a time, but they have many more generations of ancestors. And given that each generation of ancestors is composed of many, many, many more ancestors, we might predict that each generation is equally as complex AND time-sensitive.

So let's turn our attention to the current generation and its history:

Let's assume that this generation of deities has a name known to this particular generation of humans. Let's say we name it The Great Deity AKA The Great D! He, like all other deities, is born into the cosmic cosmos of the universe. From this point on, all of the remaining generations of deities are born into the same cosmic cosmos, but in different locations or dimensions. And since their dimensions are all equal...we can safely assume that deities of all generations are equally complex and time sensitive, as well...as long as they are born into a universe that is only one dimensional!

Now let's assume that the Great D is the creator/preserver of all the previous generations, and he holds all the power and knowledge to ensure that all the previous generations reach their conclusion (the creation of a world comprised only of deities). Now this is the last step in the creation of the Great Deity.
At the end of time, the Great D creates the Great World composed only of deities. It is the Great World that holds the knowledge, power and power to ensure that all previous generations reach their conclusion at the same time! And this is exactly what happens today!

So let's assume that the Great D has created this Great World entirely free of anything else. Now lets assume that no other deities exist in the current universe! And since the Great D possesses both power and wisdom, he is able to create beings and create universes that are in harmony with the Universe. So, deities aren't going anywhere in one dimensional space-times - they are all going to the infinite dimensions that make up the whole cosmos of our universe! But how do they get into these infinite dimensions?

Well, it would really take an infinite amount of energy to send those objects into space-otherwise we would only get back in space again. That is incredibly difficult for intelligent beings! So they can only send out an infinite number of particles at a certain speed...but how can they do this when the particles are in a huge amount of energy?!?! Well, they actually have the potential energy, so let's go to the next stage!

If we understand that a particle can move through space without changing its internal properties, it should also become time-equivalent! Well, the same thing can occur in time space too - if the particle is considered to be in time space, then it's simply a time-object! This means we can talk about space and time in terms of time, though it is still a time object! (or, in terms of time, we are still a physical time...the Universe also remains a form of time.)

Once the universe has been created...there will be an absolute number of possible ways to create the universe (or some other universe) that can be created without changing its internal properties! Yes, we all know that some of the possibilities must exist, since we also know that there are infinitely many potential universes that exist! However, we know that there might still exist other ways to create the universe, that could make other possible possibilities! But, yes, at least!
