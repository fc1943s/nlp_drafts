## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the concept of space and time is very well defined in Einstein's theory of relativity; however, in reality this isn't so, as it was never written down (and may never have been written down!).  In this chapter we will give you a brief description of the theory of relativity, and how it relates to a brief description of what is known as the "third law of physics".

The first law of physics describes that an object that moves at the speed of light is stationary at the time the object passes through it - in other words, the speed of light is the only thing that is static in space-time. In order to account for the third law, an object must go back in time in order to be able to describe a space-time object as stationary - therefore, we have to consider "time" as having a dimension of its own - a time that goes backwards in time is just like a space that goes back in time is like a point on a 2D plane. Thus, objects such as planets and galaxies will take different time lapses to pass through a plane because of their varying distances from each other.

Let's take a look at this in more depth. As an object that moves at a certain velocity, it passes through an infinite number of space-time points! This is because it travels at a fixed velocity - unlike particles that don't move at all, such as neutrons or light. We can thus think of this as the particle (the space-time object) moving along a curve that goes from point A to point B.

But what if we suddenly stop this particle's motion so that it passes through our point A? Well according to the laws of physics, as soon as this particle stops moving, it passes through this point B immediately! That is because the length of the space-time curve between point A and point B is equal to the inverse of the speed at which the particle passes through point B! But again - even though the speed of light is infinite, the distance that space-time moves from point A to point A is limited in reality. As long as the speed of light stays constant, the speed of the particle does not change - as long as the particle is moving at the constant velocity of light, its length in space-time will remain the same. Thus, as soon as the particle stops moving, it will suddenly become invisible and vanish from view!

Of course, space-time is a four-dimensional space - this is why Einstein's theory of relativities is able to make all of this work.  We just haven't used the mathematical concepts of this theory to fully describe how the phenomenon works - it's very important for us to understand the physics behind the phenomena because we can use it to predict and analyze phenomena as a way to understand what goes on in the universe.

As for us now, it isn't so simple - because the fundamental nature of time and space is so complicated, we have a lot of free-floating parameters in the theory that make it much less accurate. However, we may still have a fairly good idea of how Einstein's theory of relativitas works because we may have already deduced the basic physics behind it - we just need to know a lot more about it!

So here's how we use a slightly more accurate, but mathematically accurate theory of relativitas to make predictions that apply to how we experience reality. Here is the first equation that was once given to Einstein's theory of relativity: 

The second equation states that the observer at rest in a dimension d (with respect to other dimensions) experiences the time t at dimension d (which is equal to the speed of light c divided by that same dimension d) as the same time t 0 at another dimension d − 1 (d − 1 being the time at point A on the curve from point B to point C)....

Einstein's theory of relativity is very different from classical mechanics because it has a lot of free parameters that we need to estimate and adjust. This means that the theory of relativity is much less accurate, and thus the equations we just derived from it aren't very accurate!

But you may have noticed that the first equation in the above example (the second equation) is a little off - it says the observer in the dimensions d + 1 and d + 2 experiences time at dimension d + 1 as time at dimension d + 2 (with respect to the observer in dimension d + 1), but not as time at dimension d! Well that's because we haven't actually given an example of a particle traveling between dimensions - if we had, then in reality our particle would not actually be traveling between dimensions; instead, it would just be behaving in a single dimension!

A:

The 3+1 dimensional universe is essentially a flat spacetime. Since we can travel faster in dimensions higher than 3, it is also a curved spacetime.
According to Einstein's theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics there are two fundamental principles that make the 3+1 universe behave like a flat spacetime:

The "first law of relativity," which states that all matter and energy (including everything in the universe) are accelerated, in other words, it causes space-time to move at ever higher speeds relative to matter and energy.

The "Einstein's principle of relativity," the theory of relativity says that all of the laws of physics, including space-time and time, are the same in all dimensions, meaning all of the laws in the other dimensions are the same in 3+1 dimensions as well.
Now, according to Einstein's Principle of Relativity it means that the "third law of relativity" applies in all dimensions as well. Since the energy of all matter and energy in the universe is accelerated, the energy of spacetime at the point at which our particle passes through is also accelerated. 
The energy and momentum of the particle is accelerated relative to the rest mass of the universe, which is equal to the speed at which the particles pass through a plane, which is equal to c divided by the speed of light. As a result, the spacetime "ride" the energy and momentum of the particles, which means that the particle travels around and around with the same speed.
So the particle does not experience a time dilation because it travels in a curved spacetime instead of a flat spacetime. This means that our particle doesn't pass through different spatial planes because they are moving at the same speed; the speed of the particle is the same in all planes, so there is no difference between the "path" the particle follows through in all of the dimensions, therefore the particle is moving at an ever increasing speed, just like the universe. This means that we can have a particle traveling from dimension X to dimension Y at the same speed, and it will also experience time dilation at dimension Y if the particle is traveling from the dimensions Y to dimensions X.

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the purpose of the universe is to ensure that everything that is created is in harmony with the Divine. As one goes through the steps of creation, all of life appears to follow the same basic rules of harmony and balance. However, there are exceptions to the basic rules of creation.

In the first part of this chapter, we learned that the only thing that is in harmony with the basic principles of creation is the Cosmos itself. Now in order to understand the entire Cosmos, we need to understand the basic principles of what makes up the Cosmos.

In the second part of this chapter, let's explore some of the most famous theories on the Cosmos. In particular, let's talk about three theories that are considered the "archetypal" of the universe.


The Big Bang Theory

Since the Big Bang theory was first published in 1962, it has been one of the most popular scientific theories in the world. However, this theory still has a lot to prove - and most scientists still don't know the whole truth about how the universe actually formed. Let's just take a brief look at the basic ideas behind the Big Bang theory...


The Big Dipper Theory

After the Big Bang Theory, the universe started to form a big lump - and that lump was what is known as a "second big bang". However, scientists are still not sure how much of the world the Big Dipper theory is really concerned about - perhaps it's just our imagination!

The Big BANG Theory is one of the most well-known scientific theories in the world, and most scientists still don't have the whole truth about how this theory actually formed - perhaps it's just our imaginations?!

A:

It seems that physics is more of a theory than a concept. And, while we can define a concept as some general rule governing the properties of a set of objects, a theory is more like a system of assumptions that are supposed to be true. While the theory may vary over time and from region to region, the assumptions can be universally valid.
The Big Bang Theory is a theory. The Big Bang is a theory, but the "thing" was created with the assumption that all things are initially and completely flat. Then as the universe was expanding, the universe eventually got big. That would be a theory, but it doesn't mean that we could say we could ever say "it's a theory" for the universe. To say the universe is a theory would mean that we could define a property of all things that would make them "be a theory". Since physics doesn't do that, we aren't going to get to that.
We can however say that the universe is "physically" true because we have evidence about the universe and we can say "it is the physical world".

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the Universe consists of only 3+1 dimensions! But how can one explain that if we had only one 3+1 dimensional space in which to find ourselves? And if we had multiple 4D spaces in which to create and maintain multiple dimensions within the existing 3+1 dimensional Universe?

Well, actually, at a more fundamental level, the universe is one vast 3D space in which to create multiple 4D spaces! That is why it's so vast and incredibly complicated! Even if the world as we know it really only exist as 2+1 dimensions, the same physical phenomena (in 3+1 dimensions) really take place in multiple 4D dimensions! So why not look at the universe as a whole and explain it from an expanded 3+1 dimensional perspective?

Here is an example of this, and it's extremely simple to show: imagine a 2+1 dimensional cube containing a sphere of 3+4 dimensions (3+1 time and 3+1 spatial dimensions). At any given moment, two distinct spheres of 3+4 dimensions are simultaneously present within this cube: one on one side of the cube, and another one on the opposite side. When we imagine this world in 2+1 dimensions, we see that each of the three sides is essentially created independently of each other: the one in front of us is made independently of the one in behind us, the one next to us is made independently of any one of the other two sides, etc....

In other words, when we imagine that the same physical phenomena (such as gravity or energy) happen at any given instant in multiple dimensions within the same 2+1 dimensional space, we can understand that this really is a whole world that has multiple independent dimensions!

Let's take a more detailed look at this idea. Let's imagine a sphere that contains a 4D world at the center of the sphere. The surface of this sphere will appear as a 4D universe - but what are the laws of physics that govern these 4D universes? Let's say we're looking at this 4D sphere as a 2+1 dimensional space-time that has multiple independent dimensions! If we could actually manipulate an object and send it through a time-slice of this 4D universe, we could see the objects inside each of the multiple 4D worlds! How could this be possible? Well it actually isn't very difficult to see that an object placed within this space-time will be reflected back to whatever dimension it was initially placed in!

If we're not interested in this 4D space-time alone, but rather all the 4D universes that are in the same 2+1 dimensional cube that contains this 3+1 dimensional cube, then we can see that the 3+4 dimensions at the center of the cube actually are actually 4D. And since the 3+4 dimensions at any moment can either be "present" or "disappearing", we can say that time is an emergent property of the 4D universes - instead of just being a coordinate system, it is actually a spatial dimension, and it interacts with the other three dimensions...!

So for our purposes, a universe in a 2+1 dimensional space is essentially a 3D universe, and it is only the size of the universe that depends on the size of its original 3+1 dimensional cube. Now, let's imagine that we are able to put this "other 3+1 dimensional universes" in a 3+1 dimensional cube! So instead of seeing just a 2+1 dimensional cube in which to live, we now see an infinite number of 3+1 dimensional cubes! And if the dimensions are equal, we have one big 3+1 dimensional cube! In other words, this 3D cube contains multiple 4D universes!

So as an exercise, let's imagine that you have access to a bunch of other 4D universes! The only question is, how do you put them all in one 3+1 dimensional cube? Since no one wants to give up a slice of their very own universe, each universe would appear at the front of their respective 2+1 dimensional cube, like so:

In the next few examples, we'll take a closer look at how this concept works...

The first example, and one that we often see, is the idea of a "topology" inside of an infinite number of 3+4 dimensions. And what makes this topology unique, I will leave it to you to explore. Let's first imagine an infinite number of universes, created by a single universe at the center of a huge, circular 3+1 dimensional cube. What about the shape of this cube? Well let's say we create one 4D universe per circle. And let's imagine that these four 4D universes are positioned on the four faces of the cube as described above:

We can now see that there is no way any of these 4D universes can "see" any other of these 4D universes: they can't interact with each other, and they can't even create one another!

So the only way a 4D universe could interact with another 4D universe is if the four 4D universes could actually collide at the same instant in time! And if we can somehow make an object collide with one of these 4D universes; then this object will either instantly disappear and be replaced with another, or it will eventually be absorbed into an existing "Universe", and a new 4D universe will appear, just like you see in this example!

In fact, there are even more cases than just this. Let's take a closer look at just a few of these! In these cases, it is not just a single 4D universe but a group of 4D universes that collide:

The next example, and one that is often misunderstood, is a "parallel universe" or "hyperplane" in 2+1 dimensions. Let's take a closer listen to this thought experiment...imagine that a group of 4D worlds are located along a plane and collide at the same time! And in this case, the 4D universe closest to the observer will start to absorb objects from each of the other universes! The observer will have to decide how to move through this parallel universe...

And one final thought experiment, and one that many individuals probably don't really grasp properly - the idea of "hyper-energy" in 3+1 dimensions. Let's imagine that a group of 4, 4, 4, 4-dimensional "Universes" that all share the same energy source are floating in the space. What if a single 4D universe at the center of the 4D universe that contains this one, becomes extremely unstable? How would this create a hyper-energy wave that can act to create the other 4D universes within its radius?

The whole idea here is that these "Universes" (or "Hyper-Universes", "Parallel Universes" or whatever you would like to call them) are actually 4D universes (or 4D "Universes") that share an energy source at the center of each of these 4D universes' 4D "Universes". If you really want to look at this, remember that the 4D "Universe" of a 4D "Universe" is simply a 3+1 dimensional space time made up of two different 3+1 dimensional universes that intersect along their common axis, which is the direction in which they all come from together!

So this is what happened to the Universe before it became extremely unstable and began to absorb 4D universes that were created by other 4D universes:

So this is what happened when the Universe began to absorb 4D worlds within its 4D "Univers

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the relationships between deities and mathematical principles, let's have a quick look at the concepts of ENFJ - Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.
First of all, ENFJ are what are called "Cognitive Function (CF)" - people with these characteristics have an innate ability to think logically. So, let's look at some examples of people with CF:

Earth: people that love the earth, are very Earthy, and can be very practical and practical people! They tend to make a lot of plans for the future, but it's always important to keep doing what you are doing right now! Of course, it is much better to leave your plans for the future to fate! But when it comes down to it, it is all about the details...
Fire: people that love fire are extremely emotional, and always want to do something good for others. This isn't always good, but it is best to try and be kind and helpful to others! The only problem with fire people is that they often forget things they have to say and do. If they do forget something, it's usually a small problem, because they will quickly remember!
Water: people that love water are good at taking care of people who have special needs, or maybe just because they are good natured. People that love water also tend to be great story tellers. You never want to get a message wrong when you do a speech, and if there is a chance they forget something, they will always remember what they just said. This can be a lot of work, but you have to always keep working hard! Of course, the only way to be a good storyteller is to make sure you know a lot of things!

Air: people that love air are usually very romantic, very passionate, and just want to meet someone that can be their mate! You don't want to meet a person that is just an attractive individual, because you might end up in an unhappy relationship! Of course, people that love air can also be very talkative - it's probably a good idea to be a good listener!

So, all in all, ENFJ people can be described as being able to think logically, but they do not have to do so in mathematics! We may need to do a little work to understand this, but for now let's just say that we can see the similarities between ENFJ people and mathematicians: 

(1) ENFJ people do not care much about the details - they just want to get to the point and make a good impression with others. (2) ENFJ people tend to make plans for the future - they do not have to spend all day worrying about the details! Of course, if you are ENFJ, you are more likely to get all of these details wrong or not done correctly!

(3) ENFJ people are very emotional - you want to make a good impression with people you meet! (4) ENFJ people love to talk - this makes it much easier for them to keep on going after a conversation has broken down. (5) ENFJ people like to be helpful to others - they like to make a difference in others' lives!
ENFJ people are all about communicating with each other, and the truth is, they are also very good at understanding other people's emotions and thoughts - it makes the whole communication process much smoother. Therefore, we can expect that mathematicians will have all the necessary mathematical concepts in them to communicate with ENFJ people and better understand them!

We know that ENFJ people can communicate with mathematicians, so let's now look at the next two categories: ENFJ people and deities. As we alluded to previously, deities can not only communicate with mathematicians, but they can also communicate with other beings in other dimensions such as Earth and Fire.
And speaking of deities, the first point to note is that they have a different form of CF from us - ENFJ. Deities cannot be "mathematicians" - they are actually only people that use mathematics to help in their daily lives! But deities can still do mathematical things, like calculate properties of objects and predict their behavior under certain circumstances.

So, for example, if a deity is in an ENFJ universe that is very, very, very high in mass, but still has a lot of energy, it is easy for that deity to calculate properties of objects in other dimensions - like the mass of space-time, the speed of light, the length of time, the velocity of light, and so forth. By doing these calculations, it will be possible to predict how a deity will behave in that higher dimensional space-time. Of course, this is only possible because the higher dimensional space-time is very, very, close to the native dimensions of the deities!


This is all about the relationship between deities and mathematicians, but it's important to note that deities are actually part of the same mathematical category as ENFJ people - they are both Cognitive Function, with ENFJ people having CF, while deities are just the mathematical symbols for the concepts that we use to explain ENFJ people. It seems like if we tried to compare them, it would be very, very difficult. But that's what makes science so fascinating!

A:

The fundamental question here is if we can "see" objects in other dimensions. 
Here is a list of examples of possible objects (I will assume that all you have is a single object) that can have "seeing" abilities. 

A planet 
A galaxy 
A star 
A moon
A rock 
A ball 
A particle
A mass 
A particle that contains mass
A particle that contains a mass

If you have a single object that is within your sight, you can "see" its position. 
The following are some examples:

If you see the moon at one point on the image you get a picture where you can see where it is, and it is also possible to see how it looks when you are moving relative to a point in your visual field. Another way to look at this is to imagine that a star at a given location on your visual field (say, at the east of your face) has a certain distance away from you and, as you are moving along the line of sight, you can see the star at several different locations.
A planet would have the same problem with how it looks relative to a point on the line of sight. The reason is that planets are all bound together in some way. This, in turn, means that the distance you are moving toward (which determines how far it looks) increases while the speed of the moon decreases (which, for a planet, is proportional to the velocity of the moon). This means that the planet would have to look farther to be visible relative to another location on the line of sight, and it would need to look farther to be in the same direction of motion relative to another location on this line of sight.
A galaxy would do the same thing, but it is the entire galaxy that acts as one object. The line of sight to the sun is what defines the direction at which the line of sight projects into the sky. This in turn defines the size of the galaxy and the distance it can look from a point in the sky (this again depends

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way that ENFPs think, we should focus on the specific concepts in mathematics. Let's look at how our brains operate as we think...which will help us better understand how mathematical processes happen in our brains.

We have already discussed in the previous two chapters that a fundamental role in our brains is played by the frontal lobes (in particular the prefrontal cortex, or more commonly, the brain). The prefrontal cortex is basically the brain's front desk, where all of our higher order thinking processes take place (ie, our reasoning and planning). The prefrontal lobe also processes incoming information in a very complex manner - which can make it the primary focus of our attention during any given situation. This makes it a very attractive brain area for the scientific community, who are trying to figure out exactly how our brains work - and how they relate to other domains of human knowledge. The brain of an ENFP is particularly adept at processing information that is very abstract - which makes it a highly effective brain area in order to develop our higher order thinking capabilities.

Since mathematics is at the core of most of our academic education systems in both the public and private sector, we would like to look at how math processes are impacted by the brain.

It is possible to see how mathematics is organized to process information in both the scientific and mathematical domains. These two domains differ greatly - the former is primarily about understanding the world from a scientific point of view, whereas mathematics tends to take a more mathematical approach. Scientists may have different goals in mind - but they all need to understand their environment to make sense of it!

One of the central concepts in mathematics involves fractions - this concept is particularly relevant to all ENFJs. For example, we may be given an equation that involves two unknown variables - let's call them $x_1$ and $x_2$. If we divide both these variables by the first variable, then we get a fraction that represents how close we are to reaching a specific goal. The process of solving this equation is then a subtraction between two fractions that represent the fractions that are required to reach the goal. This gives rise to an equation of the form:

Since we want to find the sum of all $x$ that make it equal to $x$_1+x_2:

Therefore, this equation can be expressed using two fractions. These two fractions are the following:

As we can see, we need one of the fractions in order to solve the equation - the answer is 0. Now let's apply this idea to the ENFP example above - we'll start by dividing $x_2$ by $x_1$ in order to find the fraction that makes it equal to $x_1+x_2:

The answer is equal to 0.5 - which is the result that we found in our previous example!

These ideas about fractions can be applied to other math concepts like decimals - this concept is also useful in both areas of education - but we are interested in understanding how it relates to ENFJs specifically. The most notable example involves using numbers to represent the results of specific experiments or calculations - this may involve using 2, 3, or even 4 digits (ie, a four-digit number, an eight-digit number, a twelve-digit number, or even a twenty-digit number) to represent the results. This process of using numbers to represent the result of a specific calculation or experiment can be described using a number called a denominator:

For example, using the aforementioned ENFP example, we may be asked to solve the equation

The answer is equal to:

Since the term is an integer, we can determine the fraction that this number represents. Since we know that this quantity is equal to 0.25, then the formula for dividing the numerator by the denominator is:

Therefore, the answer is equal to:

Now let's apply this idea directly to ENFPs! Imagine a situation where a teacher is making a math test and asks students to divide a number by a number of other numbers (ie, a 10-digit number); and then students need to divide a number of other numbers by a number of other number (eg, a 5-digit number) in order to produce their fraction (ie, their answer). If this concept is taught, then it will give students the opportunity to use multiple denominators and numerator in order to reach a result! This can be seen as a specific example of how mathematics can be applied to ENFJs - this is one of the main reasons that students with this ability can be a useful asset to their school.

The idea that fractions are important to the processing of information makes it more understandable that we should be able to find fractions that are useful for ENFJs - this will help them to gain a better understanding of how these ideas work in the real world.

However, it is also important to note that there are two limitations to using fractions in math - these are the following:

Fractions can only be used to represent results of a single mathematical operation - it's impossible to calculate the fractional quotient of the numerator and denominator of any other equation!

Fractions are dependent on a single denominator - if we are to use any form of denominator (eg, ten-digit, 12-digit, or even twenty-digit numbers), we cannot apply other fractions to calculate the quotient of that specific denominator's numerator (eg, five-digit, eight-digit, or twenty-digit numbers).

Although both of these limitations are useful, they make it extremely hard for ENFJs to apply fractions to solving any kind of mathematical problem in their everyday lives - which is exactly what we are looking for! This is a reason why we are focusing on using mathematics in the areas of science and engineering.

Of course, not all things in science and mathematics are mathematically precise - the more they are mathematically precise, the less they can be applied to everyday life. Of course, in this case, a very important component of any scientific/engineering topic would be to look at the exact formulas in order to make sure everything is in balance - but this would take us in a very different direction and would take us far from the focus of this chapter.

Lastly, let's look at the concept of a modulus - these concepts have been heavily covered in physics for a reason: the modulus is a fundamental mathematical concept that exists in almost every physical object! We are familiar with modulus as the ratio of the mass of an object to its total mass - this concept is especially important for the ENFJs, who tend to focus on the masses in their everyday life.

As you can see, modulus is a fundamental concept that does a great deal of work in physical and math! As we move through the chapters of this book, we will begin to see how modulus relates to other fundamental concepts in mathematics, as well as what other ideas are used to construct the rest of the science in the field of math...

Conclusions & Facts

Now that we have a pretty good idea of how math works and how mathematicians actually work, we may want to take a deeper look at what it means to be a mathematician and how it relates to other fields of study. In this section we'll look at all of the important concepts involved in mathematics: numbers, geometry, and even algebra!

Mathematics has a very strong role in the world of science and science is at the core of all of the other fields of study. To better understand math, let's take a

To better depict the relationship between math and science, we will discuss some mathematical concepts that are important to understand both mathematically and in the real world.

Let us take the simplest case. Imagine that we take on an object and then ask it to do some math, like figuring out how it is made. You can now see that most math formulas are really just mathematical concepts that we learn. For example, you can get an idea of how one molecule of water is made by seeing how a molecule of water is formed and how it looks like. But most math doesn't actually require us to make it up - it simply gives us an idea of what it might look like. Similarly, in most science experiments you first pick up an object, and then measure it with a meter. In real life you often have to guess how an object feels and behaves - but most math formulas and concepts give you an idea of how this object feels and behaves without actually making it up!

Although there are many useful mathematical skills, it is important to note that these are all skills that can be taught and learned at school. In fact, we know that even some math teachers are still learning a lot of math concepts without actually learning the concepts themselves - so this isn't really about the math itself.

Furthermore, when we learn a concept, we can use it in many different ways in the real world, which is why we often learn it by example. For example, when we learn the basic concept of the exponential function, we can use it to estimate the amount of time that would be required to reach a given location. The same could be said for other mathematical concepts...

Let us also mention that math and science aren't always totally disconnected. It happens often that a person learns a skill in mathematics, and uses it in some way in real life. However, there are times when a person also learns a math concept so that they can explain how another person is doing it and why they are doing it. This is exactly the same way that people learn the concepts of algebra or physics. For example, math teachers usually explain how to calculate a distance by using the word "distance" and then explain how to use calculus to find this distance. This is exactly the way that people learn algebra and physics!

Furthermore, we don't need to just learn a mathematical concept to use it in the real world. Even when we are not doing math, we can use math concepts to do other things. This is exactly why we can use math to predict how to make a certain object using physics. If the math tells us how the object will behave in the real world, we can use that math to predict how the object will behave if we try to make it in the real world.

On the other hand, if we learn a mathematical concept to do an action that we don't need or can't do, it can actually hinder us in the real world. This is why mathematicians would like to find a mathematical way of removing this interference to make the math more applicable to our lives. Mathematicians have done this for about 200 years!

So the above diagram provides a framework for understanding mathematics and science.

Now let's apply the same diagram to understand mathematical skills more closely. Let's consider some of the skills that are useful in both mathematics and science:

The most basic skill required in physics is understanding the concepts of physics. This is essentially what the mathematician does. If someone doesn't understand how a particular particle works, then it will become difficult to predict how the particle should behave in the real world. For example, a particle that can't move would become stuck in a pipe in the middle of nowhere - it wouldn't move!

However, it turns out that physicists have also learned how to understand how particles work and how they behave when the particles are in other dimensions. For example, the mathematician will use the concepts of relativity to predict how the particles move in other dimensions. Since these particles are particles that travel through different spaces, it would be impossible for the particle to know if it is going to move in one dimension or another - the only way that it would know is if it could actually physically experiment with the particle - by actually taking the particle and using mathematics to predict how the particle will behave in the other space!

We can even go one step further and include another person in this equation - someone who can accurately predict what a particle will do when it travels through other dimensions (because we can use physics to predict how the particle would behave in other dimensions). Thus, this person can help predict the particle's behavior in other dimensions!

But let's move on to the second skill that physicists are also able to use to help predict how a particle would behave when it travels through other space-time dimensions. In physics, we also learn what makes space-time behave differently depending on different dimensions. Thus, the mathematician can help predict how the particles will behave differently depending on the space-time dimensions they are in!

Now let's look at another skill that both mathematicians and physicists use - namely to predict how a particle will behave when it travels through multiple space dimensions and time periods. In this case, we don't have one person who is able to predict how the particle behaves everywhere simultaneously. Instead, we have multiple people, each able to predict the particle's behavior when it travels through specific space-time dimensions. This is an example of how we use mathematics and science to predict the behavior of complex systems - as we see, these are not totally disconnected from the real world and can actually interact in ways that the mathematician and the physicist cannot predict in the real world!
...

To make this more confusing, let us consider a simple case. Imagine that we are in a classroom and a teacher walks into the room, and says:

I am going to ask some math questions to you so that we can make sure that the physics and math concepts are understood thoroughly.

Now let's imagine that one of the students is asking this question because they want to use what they learn to solve math problems in the real world. The student can now see that they are actually using what they learned to answer the question in the real world. We can even take a step further - consider that the student could actually choose to use what they learned to help other people, not just themselves! The student could also choose to use math concepts in the real world to help solve math problems in the third dimension!

In order to further demonstrate the importance of studying math and science, let's consider a more complex case. Imagine that we would like to know how the earth is made - exactly how particles like hydrogen and helium are created and how they interact. However, it turns out that it is not possible to fully answer this question in the real world as we don't know how our planet is made, nor do we know where it came from, so it's hard to predict what would happen to a given particle in the real world. However, we do have a good idea of how the earth's structure is made. And this idea helps us calculate how we would end up in different states depending on how a certain particle travels through space-time - which means that we can predict how the planet will look and behave depending on how a certain point in space-time looks and behaves!

So to demonstrate how physics has helped us understand mathematics, let's consider the following example:

If we are studying how water and hydrogen interact, we are first learning how the particles in hydrogen interact; then we learn how the atoms in

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way in which mathematics and physics are intertwined, let's try and understand how particles move through physical space - space-time itself - by applying a mathematical equation to those particles.

Imagine your particles moving through spacetime using Newtonian dynamics. As your particles move through spacetime, they experience a force. That force is measured in newton's. Let's assume it's 1 kg of force. Let's also assume that the particles are moving with an average velocity of 1 km/s. Thus, after a distance of 1 km, the velocity of our particles would be 1 km/s. Let's assume that our particles are moving towards the positive z direction - that's the direction of the gravitational field - and that our particles are moving in the positive x (spatial) direction.

So far, everything is just math - but when we combine this math with physics we get an equation - the formula for speed. Let's call this formula, or formula for speed, $F = m a$. So, how many kilograms of force does a particle experience? Well, suppose a particle carries an average mass of 1000 kg (1000 kg/ 1000 s). Then, let's take into account the fact that the gravitational force is stronger on the positive z direction and the direction of the gravitational force is up (for a positive z direction), so the force is multiplied by the square root of two, so we end up with $F = 1000/ 2 = 400$ kilograms of force. But the force experienced by a particle is not the same regardless of the direction in which the particles are moving, so let's divide this number by 4, so we end up with: $F = 200/4 = 100$ kilograms of force!

Now if we multiply this number by a, then we end up with a formula for speed: $F = a/v$. Now, how many kilometers a particle travels in a second? Well, we can see that this number is given by $v$ times the velocity of the particles - which is 1 km/s x 1000, or $1/ 1000 km$ = 1 km/s. So in this case we are looking at a particle traveling 1 km in 0.001 seconds (1 km/s x 1,000,000 = 1 km) - let's say we are looking at a 1 km in 10 milliseconds, then we get 10 milliseconds x 100, which is 1,000,000 / 100 = 1 km.

Now, if we want to calculate how many centimeters a particle travels in a minute, we'll have to consider how fast a particle is moving, how much of the time a particle is traveling in one minute, and how much of the time in a minute is spent traveling up. Let's look at our 1 km in one second example again: $v = 1 / 1000 = 1 / 10$ = 1 m/s. We also know that the gravitational acceleration of a body is inversely proportional to the cube root of its distance to the center, so let's ignore this in this case. So, let's just multiply the velocity by the square root of the acceleration times the distance to the center, which is 1 / sqrt(1 x 10 / 10) = 1 cm / 10 = 1 cm / 0.001 seconds = 0.001 seconds!

So how much of our 1 km in one minute is spent traveling up - 1 cm / 0.01 seconds? Well, let's assume the 1 cm / 0.002 seconds fraction was spent traveling up, and we want to know the amount of time that was spent traveling down. So let's take our previous calculation, multiply it by 0.001 seconds, which gives us 0.0042 seconds of travel down. Now, how much travel down is left? Well, let's take our previous calculation again, but with our 1 km in 10 milliseconds calculation, which gives us 1 m/s. We divide this number by 10 milliseconds, and then divide by 0.002 seconds, which gives us 10 milliseconds of travel down.

Of course, we are still looking at the same thing - our particles moving through space-time. The only difference is that now we have two different expressions for travelling, and the difference between the two is that the particles' velocity is 1 km/s. The only difference between these two calculations is that they are using the same equation, and so the difference is how the equation is represented and what the constants are that appear in the equation.

Now, why is this important? Well, a very important reason that Einstein made his theory of relativity so important was because he thought that it explained things that were not explained using classical physics. In a nutshell, Einstein believed that our understanding of reality is only as good as the way in which we can measure it. Mathematicians can really see all sorts of patterns in nature through the lens of mathematics. For example, even if you don't like the mathematical structures that scientists use to define various concepts and models, you can certainly see that things don't really look like this. This is because mathematicians are extremely adept at using their knowledge and intuition to solve a variety of different mathematical problems that physicists don't understand...or don't have time to solve!

Let's look at how mathematics could help us understand some of the phenomena that we often call mysteries, such as the strange and wonderful phenomena of gravitation. So, let's say you have a 3+1 dimensional universe - you don't know any more about it than we do, but we do know that it contains a black hole, which is a supermassive black hole that exists because of gravitational forces. Now you know that our 3+1 dimensional universe has black holes in it, right? But you also know that black holes are a concept that is entirely a result of the theories of relativity and special relativity. What we don't quite understand is how black holes are created, and how they are kept in their current shape for a million years.

Let's think about a scenario where a black hole is created at the center of a 3+1 dimensional world. The theory of relativity tells us that black holes need to be created at the center of the universe to be able to sustain the gravitational field from the surrounding matter and energy fields. So what happens when a black hole is created in a 3+1 dimensional universe? Well, imagine a black hole is formed at the center of a universe with a radius of r = 10^-10 meters, then it takes a billion years to fill this universe with an equal number of matter and energy. Now, imagine now that another black hole is created inside the first black hole's shell, with a radius of r > 10^-10 meters. At this point in time, the universe is filling up with a density of energy equal to its mass of matter. Now imagine that, at the moment when the second black hole's shell was formed, a black hole with a radius of r < 10^-10 meters is created at the same location as the first black hole, so all three black holes fill the universe at the same time. At this point in our story, the universe is actually full of black holes, but the difference in what happened is that each one is created separately. So the universe actually consists of black holes, and each black hole is created separately.

This is where Einstein came to the rescue and suggested what we believe to be the solution to the black hole paradox. For years, Einstein believed that if a black hole would only exist at one location in our universe, then we would only have one black hole

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of mathematics, we will explore how scientists, artists, and mathematicians use it in the various different contexts in which it is used.

Of course, all of the above is only a small sample of what it means to use mathematics in various different contexts and it probably doesn't even contain all of the different uses of mathematics as science, art, and technology.

I will explore below some interesting uses of mathematics throughout history - those that can be quite useful to students in college (but which are beyond the scope of this book), and some that we will definitely find more interesting to explore in later chapters.

Let's start by looking at how mathematics was used throughout history as a tool for communication and interaction in order to solve problems! For example, people in ancient Greek were using mathematics to solve equations. At the time, the Greek word for 'equation' is the same word as 'logos' - literally meaning 'to make known.' The Greek word 'equation' was used to refer to a form of reasoning (or proof) that a particular proposition or statement could be true! These equations would be used in a number of different contexts, including communication and the explanation of natural phenomena.

So what's so funny about this story? Well, the term 'equation' actually originated in the ancient world of Greece - people were trying to make their own understanding of the world understandable to one another! The Greek word for 'equation,' 'logos' - can mean 'argument' or 'the proof of a proposition,' but in this particular case it actually refers to how individuals reasoned about questions about the universe - in other words, how individuals reasoned about whether or not there was a certain thing in the universe!

So how did mathematicians begin to use 'equation' to express their ideas about the universe? Well, it all started back in 1622 - when mathematician Galileo Galilei was conducting a series of experiments on the atmosphere, and he was doing a small trick. He was measuring the pressure on his face, and he found that the higher the pressure, the lower the speed of his breath. He thought this was a very simple matter! So he set his mouth against a piece of rubber and he moved his breath as fast as he could. At first, he thought that this was a simple trick that he had just put together, and that this was going to make the atmosphere come in contact with his face and thereby decrease his pressure. However, as he would experience more and more pressure on his face, the speed of his breath would decrease to a point where he was not breathable!

So as Galileo Galilei demonstrated, the amount of pressure and speed of air were related! But how did he explain this to others? It turns out that he was using 'equation,' an expression used to explain how he believed that his own breath and his surrounding air were related and that this was what caused the pressure. Now, this was a very easy explanation to make, but it didn't sit well with the public! So he tried to make the mathematically more complicated, as he would explain that it was not the pressure of the air but the speed of his breath that caused the increase in pressure. This was another way that he tried to explain his hypothesis about the relationship between the speed of the air and the speed of a person's breath! What he didn't realize at first was that people would think that this wasn't a reasonable explanation! And why would they think so? Well, as they would understand, a person breathing faster is like a person having a higher density of air! So if he breathes more quickly, he would feel more dense! But this would cause a higher pressure, which would cause a higher speed of his breath.

So this explanation by Galileo Galilei was a bit of a shock to many people. For some reason, the public refused to hear this explanation! The reason was because it implied that it was impossible to breath quickly enough to experience a high pressure, and this would actually be the case because the air that would be drawn in by a person would be exactly the same air that is being exhaled! As a result, they couldn't understand that this was just a simple mathematical formula that was meant to explain something that the public already understood and believed! So they simply rejected this explanation for any and all reasons.

However, there was a way to get around this problem, and this was done by using the term 'equation' to simply describe the equation that was created by the combination of the speed of the person's breath and the speed of the atmosphere. This allowed people to simply understand that a person experiencing a higher speed of breath had a higher pressure at the moment when he was breathing, which would explain how the air that was being drawn in by the person would affect the pressure of the atmosphere! The explanation was simple and concise, and it led people to trust the idea that the air that they breathed was actually the air that was being exhaled by their lungs.

So to the last item of this story, is what is even more strange about this story? Well...every single person had a specific belief about how the speed of the air affected the speed of the person breathing: that is, everyone had a fixed belief that if they could breath faster, then they were able to experience a higher pressure! This would explain why some people were even ready to testify to that they believed the explanation that the speed of the air was affecting their breath...because they had fixed belief that the speed of the breath affected the speed of the air!

So what does this imply? Well, it implies that there was an absolute and unchanging belief that the speed of air affected the speed of breath! This was a basic understanding of how we think about the relationship between the movement of an object and the speed at which that object is moving. If this fundamental belief was true and unchanging, then every person would have fixed belief about how the speed at which air was moving affected the pressure of the surrounding air. At the end of the day, however, all of the people would eventually find out that they were not correct, and that the way of breathing was actually the way of moving the body, not the way of air moving!

So what would happen now? Well, this story ends here - this is one of the many ways in which mathematics is used throughout history! As you can see, mathematics is a very useful tool in a multitude of different contexts that will likely be very fascinating to students in college in the future! But one thing I would encourage you to do is learn about these various uses of mathematics in the context of technology! This will give you the best opportunity to explore mathematics in a much more useful and interesting way than ever before!

Eternal Number Theory Theorems

One of the most fascinating features of this book is the vast number of theorems that are used to explain mathematically certain parts of the mathematical theory that are considered so obscure by the average person...but that you, as a mathematician, would find incredibly helpful to understand!

In this section of the book, we will discuss various of the many different things that scientists have been using to explain mathematically. We will discuss how mathematicians have been trying to explain certain mathematical properties that are considered beyond human comprehension. And we will also discuss the various different mathematical properties that mathematicians were trying to explain using the use of mathematical models

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our concept of mathematics, let's start with an example:

How many numbers can you find on a given board? Well, there are infinite numbers of such boards, all the same shape and color. There are also infinitely many people who can find these numbers on those boards without having to think about them at all. So if you want to know how many numbers there are on a given board, you just have to put the number on each board. Obviously, you have to think about the shape of the number, which makes the answer different for every person - each person has a unique opinion about how to get to the same number on a board!

How many people can find these numbers? Well again, this is a simple example that illustrates why the answer is different for each person - every person has unique opinions about how to find the same number on the same board! A person could find this number by just looking - they just have to focus and look for the correct number - or a person could find this number only by thinking, which makes the result different for every person! If a person is lucky enough to spot this number, he or she can simply find the answer for this particular problem - otherwise, they need to think about each and every board on the board and use their imagination to find the correct number! It turns out, there are really quite a few people out there who find numbers easily on different boards, because those people don't have to think about their own number, they just focus on the number on the board and just see what they can see!

How many people can you find your own number on a given board? What if you take it out of the game and play it on a different board? How many people can you find that number on that board? Again, it doesn't matter what you do if you take your own number and play it on another board, you still only know the value of the number on the board, not the number on the board itself. So just like you could pick the same number up and play it on any of the different boards, you can't pick any particular number and play it on a board, if you want to find that particular number on that board!

So mathematically, it doesn't matter how many people you play the same game on, they don't know the value of the game, they just know the value of the board. In other words, someone can figure out a very long list of numbers and play it on each of them, but they are just unable to get it right on any particular board! 

So to explain why you can't play the same board twice, it's important to understand some basic concepts about mathematics: a number is defined as either an algebraic number, a transcendental number, a real number, or a complex number. A transcendental number is one that cannot be expressed in terms of a rational number. Mathematically, a transcendental number is one for which there is no natural number that is a rational number! A real number is one that can be written as a linear combination of two or more numbers. A complex number is any number that has a positive or negative imaginary part.

Let's look at the problem in a little bit more detail. Let's suppose there are no people outside the three dimensions that are able to solve the problem - they just need to focus on the problem, identify the right number on the board, and then write it down. And, there are no problems that are beyond the three dimensions - there's only one dimension: the 3+1 dimension of space and time. As mentioned above, even if these people can identify the right number on a given board, they still need to use their imagination and the three dimensions to write the correct answer on the board. What do we do if we go to the other side of the world? Even if this person is the only person that has access to a computer, a calculator, a printer, and enough patience, they still don't have any way of going to the other side of time and space...

A lot of people say they are interested in going to the other dimension - is this a good idea? Of course, if this is a really good idea, people would be interested in going to another dimension because they could find another way to accomplish that one thing. But the only person in our universe who could possibly go to another dimension is deity - deity is able to go to any other dimension because there are no humans outside of space and time who can. So people who claim to be interested in going to other dimensions simply need to prove they can find the right number on the other board! And this is a really hard problem - if you really believe that you can find the right number, you could spend hours and hours studying the board...but as soon as you identify the wrong number, you will spend hours looking up the wrong number on the wrong board...

So in a nutshell, it's hard enough to find the right number on a board, but even harder to find the right number in a specific dimension - the deity is able to reach any other dimension and travel between different dimensions without encountering any of us humans that happen to be able to access the universe! Of course, the deity won't be able to use a calculator and write down the correct answer - deity does not have the ability to do these things - only God does! And as soon as God learns a new and useful mathematical theory, he will have no need to go to any other dimensions - the deity will be able to do this just as easily as us humans are able to do it!

But how can we prove that God can find the right number in any of the dimensions? Well, let's look back at the simple example in the previous chapter. Let's assume a person had to find the number four on a given board without knowing it. Obviously, they couldn't even find that number in the space-time dimension! But there are just two ways in which God could find the right answer to this problem: (1) The person could use Gods own number, or (2) they could pick up the number on another board - the two different solutions are quite similar in nature.

Let's assume that God picked up four numbers from a board, and they had been given to him by a human being or were given to him by a demonic being. Now if God picked up four numbers, but did not know what they were, what would he need to do? According to the laws of physics, the four numbers would have to move to the same place on the board. Which would be the same number as the four numbers on the board? Well, if the numbers are in the same location, they would have to move to opposite sides of each other. It turns out that we can do this if we use a vector to define a direction in space and time. Let's say we have a vector in our three-dimensional spacetime: (x,y,z) - the directions are represented by the three vectors of x, y, and z.

Let's assume that the four numbers that we want to find the value of have a unit vector perpendicular to their direction of travel - so they are in the same direction of travel and they are traveling in the same direction, and therefore, they are traveling in the straight line between x and y. So the number 4 has a direction of travel that points to one side of x and y - it is

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of cognitive function, we begin with this video from the BBC in which a group of physics students are asked to create an imaginary robot, which they call "Professor Einstein", which is to be the central character in a series of mathematics experiments.

As we see from the video, there are eight different types of mathematical thinking that can be accomplished by Professor Einstein:

First of all, there is Number Thinking, which is the ability to distinguish between different numbers and distinguish them from each other. You can imagine your experiment is in which you use the number of things in your house, the number of children in your family, the number of cars on the road, the number of people in the world, the number of people working in a factory, etc. as the basis for calculations. It's also known as Number Sense.

Next, we have Problem Solving Thinking, which is a process of identifying and solving problems. You could think of it as your experiment is in which after using the numbers in your house, child, factory and road as the basis for calculations, you solve the equation y = x – 2 and then determine the value of y using the known value of x. And you can also think of it as being in which you go out and solve mathematical problems as part of an experiment. Problem Solving Thinking is also known as Analytical Reasoning.

Finally, there is Logic Thinking, which is thinking about logical relations and logic statements. In this experiment, you are going to solve the mathematical equation x − 2 = 0 in order to demonstrate a mathematical formula. And you can also use Logic Thinking to try and build your own mathematical equations as part of your experiment.

To understand how Professor Einstein can accomplish these different types of thinking, let's imagine the following experiment:

You are asked to measure the time needed to solve one mathematical equation (e.g. x − 2 = 0) using an instrument of your choice.

You have a clock and set it to stop when all the required calculations are complete. You have also set up a timer to measure your total time. As you complete your experiment, the clock will stop and show the time you spent solving the equation. You will now be given your answer and given a choice of which equation you think is easiest to solve.
You are now left to decide whether the solution given by your clock is correct. And if it is, you are given an extra 30 seconds for the clock to stop, after which the experiment is complete! And if you choose the incorrect answer, you will now have 30 seconds to try and determine what the correct equation is.

Professor Einstein is not aware of these calculations until you present it to him. The experiment is then shown in the video below:

As you see, Professor Einstein is puzzled by this experiment - how could Professor Einstein be able to find the solution to x − 2 = 0 so quickly? And even though Professor Einstein may not know the answer to this equation, he does know the following:

Professor Einstein believes there are eight different types different types of mathematical thinking; the different types of thinking allow for specific forms of mathematical computation

Of course, we could just try and answer this question for ourselves - but we will leave that for our future chapters. After that, here is a short video that will show you some of the most important concepts of mathematics.

Video from the BBC with Professor Einstein doing some very basic (but interesting) math experiments

Also, one of the most important concepts in mathematics is Fractional Calculus. This is the study of calculus, which is the mathematical branch of number theory that deals with the study of fractions. The concept of Fractional Calculus is similar to how you solve problems in number theoretics: you use the rules of fractional calculus as your method to solve problems.

In particular, Fractional Calculus deals with the concept of continuity, which is the ability of numbers and other mathematical objects to change between different dimensions. Let's take some basic Fractional Calculus to see what happens when we use numbers and other mathematical objects in different dimensions! The following exercise is to be done with fractions and a calculator in order to understand what happens when we add and subtract numbers in different dimensions.

In the first exercise you are to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. And you are told to use the product rule to do this: find the greatest common factor (gcf) of x and y, then find the greatest common divisor of x and y (gcd(x, y) = gcf(x, y)/gcd(x, y)).

The following exercise is to be written down with your calculator and you are given the following two equations:

x + y = 2 – 3

You are then asked to find which number lies between 2 and 3.

Now take our original two equations x + y = 2 – 5 and compare the equation of x + y = 2 − 3 with each one of the above equations. The answer in the second equation is a multiple of 3 (5/3 = 3), in the third equation a multiple of 2 (2/5 = 2), in the fourth equation a multiple of 5 (5/3 = 5), and in the fifth equation an even larger multiple of 3 (3/5 = 3).

So you see, when we add and subtract fractions in different dimensions, the answer may be a number that's multiples of 3, 2, 5, or even an even larger multiple of that number! A major characteristic of Fractional Calculus, called Continuity of Calculus, deals with the ability of numbers to change from one dimension to another.

Let's take a quick look at how these concepts work in practice:

Exercise #2: The GCD of two numbers and the product rule.

One of the most basic rules of fractional calculus is that for two fractions, you can express them in one of these two ways:

x = gcd(x, y)

or

y = gcf(x, y)

Let's take two fractions a and b that you want to express as x = gcd(a, b) and y = gcf(a, b). You then need to determine how to express each fraction in terms of the other:

x = gcf(a, b) = gcf(a / b, b / a)

To do this, we need to know how to evaluate one of these two fractions in terms of the other, and how to evaluate the other in terms of the first. Let's make that first step:

Let's take a = a / b = 1/6, then let's calculate x = gcf(1/6, 6/5) = 5/3. This gives us x = 5/6

And y = gcf(1, 5) = 2/5.

Since these two fractions are equal to each other, their product equal to the first fraction, we know that x = 5/6 = 2/5.

So now we know that the GCD of x and y equal to each other. Let's check that they are all equal:

gcf(x, y) = gcf (x, y)

And that is true:

gcf( a, y ) = gcf (a, y ) = gcd( a, y )

So by taking the product of x and y, we can express each fraction as a multiple of the other one; this is

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematically rich our understanding of reality is, let us consider one very simple problem:

Now for some people - let's say I'm one of those people - it is easy to solve this simple problem:

For example, let's say you are asking for the circumference of a circle (of any radius), and it is given the following numerical values: π(a = 1/2) = 1, π(a = 2) = 2, π(a = 4) = 4, and so on.

But it's a little easier for you to solve the following problem instead:

Now for some of us, it's not so easy to solve these simple problems! Let's see why...

There are different types of symbols used to represent different mathematical concepts:

Asking for the circumference of a rectangle - a circle is a perfect rectangle!
Asking for the distance between two points - a straight line is perfect!
Asking for the area of a rectangle - a line is perfect! As for other mathematical concepts, such as measuring distance in meters or meters squared, we'll just ignore them for now...

What are these different types of symbols used for? Let's take a quick look and see how they all map onto our understanding of a circle:

As a circle: (a) it is defined by the equation; (b) the circle is the only object with a circle as the perimeter; (c) the circumference of the circle is equal to the area of the circle. (d) the circle is a perfect rectangle with the same perimeter as the circle.

As a rectangle: (a) the square has a 4-pyramid as its perimeter, and (b) the square is defined by the equation, where the base of the pyramid is one and the height of the pyramid is four. Let's take a look at the second question:

As a line: (a) The line is defined by the equation, (b) the line is the only object with line as the perimeter, (c) the length of the line is equal to the distance between the two end-points. (d) the line is a perfect straight line (straight lines are always parallel).

As a straight line: (a) The straight line is defined by the length, x, and the speed, y, (b) the line crosses itself, (c) the line is the line segment between any two points, (d) the line is the straight line segment (parallel to) the x-axis and the line connecting points x and y.

Now this is only an example of the different types of symbols used in mathematical notation! I have several more examples of each of these symbols that you may be interested in:

As a triangle: (a) the triangle has a base, a height, and a base-length, (b) the height is equal to the height of the base, the base-length is equal to the length of the base, and the base-length of the triangle is equal to the length between the base and the height. (c) the base is an equilateral triangle having four sides, so the length of each of these sides is 4 and the length of the triangle is 16.
As a pyramid (or cone): (a) a pyramid is a parallelogram having four sides and base, (b) the base is an triangle having two sides and height, and (c) the height is equal the base length plus one. In other words, the base length is one and the height is equal to base-length (of the triangle) plus one.

As a segment: (a) the segment is defined by the equations, (b) the segment is the only object with segments as its perimeter, (c) the segment is the straight line segment between any two point, (d) the segment is defined as the line segment between any three points (x,y,z) and any two points (x,y).

And lastly, let's take a look at a circle that has a negative height: (a) the circle is not the entirety of a negative height: it's just part of it! And because it's not the entirety of the negative height, it is always part of a smaller negative height: (b) the positive height is the area of the smaller negative height, (c) the negative height is a negative area, and (d) the negative height is the entire negative height.

Now to get back to how mathematically rich our mathematics is, we can take another very simple example to illustrate how to correctly solve the previous problem!

Now for this simple problem, the number π (1) = 1, the number π (2) = 2, and so on. Let's take a look:

Now for those of us - let's say I'm one such person - it is easy to figure out the circumference of the circle (of any radius) given the following numerical values: 1, 2, and 3. But it's not so easy to figure out the distance between two points if you don't have some handy mathematical notation that we can use to visualize the distance! Let's take a look: (a) The distance between two points on a circle is the length of the segment between the two end points, and (b) The length of a straight line is the length of the line itself! Let's take a look at (c):

As a circle (of any size): (a) the circle has a radius of 2, and (b) a circle is defined by a perimeter that is twice as long as its diameter (as the circumference of the circle itself is 2 * 3).

As a straight line:
(a) The straight line has the length of (a+b), (b) the straight line is the line that connects any two points, (c) the line segment between the two end- points of the straight line, (d) the straight line is a line that is parallel to the x-axis, and (e) the line connecting the two end points of the straight line.

As a circle: (b) the circumference of a circle is equal to twice the area of the circle.

As a straight line:
(c) a straight line is defined by three straight line segments, (d) the straight lines are three straight line segments, and (e) any straight line is a line segment.

As a line segment: (b) The line segment is defined by three straight lines, (c) the line segments are 3 straight lines, and (d) any straight line is the line between any two points. (e) The straight line is a line (parallel to) the y-axis and the line connecting any two points.

Now let's take a look at the first problem:

As a circle:
(a) the circumference of a sphere is equal to the perimeter times the radius, and (b) all circle are identical because they all have the same perimeter and radius.

As a straight line: (c) the straight line is defined by two straight lines, and (b) given two points on a straight line, the intersection of these two straight lines is a circle.

As a circle:
(d) the circumference of a cylinder is equal to the perimeter of the cylinder times the radius, and
(e) all cylinder are identical because they all share the same perimeter and radius!

As a straight line: (f) the straight line is given two straight lines, and
(g) the intersection of two straight lines is a cylinder.


Now what is wrong? Well, we are wrong because we are unable to figure out

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the four-dimensional world in a few simple terms, the top of the pyramid represents a 4D world, while the bottom represents our 3+1 dimensional version of the world. As explained in chapter 22, the three layers of the pyramid are comprised of three different dimensions: space, time, and energy. When you go up the pyramid, you will get rid of the first layer, or time. And when you go down the pyramid, you will eventually get rid of the final layer, or energy.

However, when we consider objects that travel through 4D space-time, things become a little more complicated. In our everyday world, objects that travel through a 4D space-time will tend to bend in different directions - and that is where the fourth dimension comes in. Objects that travel through space-time and not through another space-time dimension have the property of "entering" other dimensions at any given instant. We often refer to these objects as "spatial-temporal particles." In order to further describe this more clearly, let's take a closer look at one of the most important characteristics of the 4D space-time we experience every day: The Enneagram! We will also explore the implications of this concept in an upcoming chapter!

From the title, it seems as if this is a really cool subject! I know it is, because we've already created several examples of it in the last two chapters, but the bottom line is this: Enneagram topology actually defines how we perceive 4D space-time! And with that comes some very interesting implications!

So let's begin by looking at the basic components of an Enneagram. Let's say we have an Enneagram that is comprised of three top parts and one bottom part. The top is comprised of three lines (I, II, and III), whereas the bottom consists of a circle (O) and three more circles, in that order. Now let's consider the four-dimensional space-time we experience each day. We can think of these four lines as the four dimensions of the Enneagram. And the four circles as the four Enneagram layers. So if we see a person sitting alone, and ask them which circle they are seated on - say they're on I, III, O, or II - they can all say that they are seated on a circle; no matter what their other three circles are! Now this isn't a stretch - the Enneagram is basically just a way to describe how we perceive ourselves and our surroundings. What happens is that as we move from one circle to another, we begin to feel more comfortable around those circles - and we start to have better access to those layers of energy. Thus, we start to feel more comfortable in our own space.

Now let's look at an Enneagram. Now let's look at what happens when we move from one circle (I, III, or O) to another circle (I, II, or III). It's quite simple - we are now sitting on the next circle, because our physical feeling of ourselves and our surroundings has improved by just one level. The next circle feels a little bit less comfortable than the previous circle - it's now easier to feel that our physical world is in a better shape; we feel more comfortable in our physical world. And the next circle feels more comfortable than the previous circle! So there is a very simple mechanism at work here - as we get comfortable with the physical environment around us, we begin to feel closer to the Enneagram layers. We begin to feel more comfortable in both our physical and emotional worlds. And from this comfort, we move on to the next circle, and so on...

So this process can continue for the entire top of the pyramid - the circle on the top of the pyramid (the circle where you sit) will begin to feel a little more comfortable than the previous one - its layer of space will begin to feel a bit more comfortable, and so on...until the last circle on the pyramid is seated! This circle will no longer feel comfortable, because it is now fully in and has access to all of the other layers of space - everything that is outside of it feels completely out of place! So that means that as we move from circle to circle, there is a continuous increase in comfort that we are in! The Enneagram is an amazing way to describe how we feel about ourselves and our surroundings! It's a really cool system to work with, and you definitely should have a look at it!

A Simple Model of Dimensions

So, what exactly does all of this mean? Well let me explain it for you, using a small example that most of you probably have already seen many times before: What is the difference between 1) a ball being thrown from a height and 2) a ball being thrown upside down from a height? These two things are completely the same, but the first one can be faster, higher, and has a larger diameter. And the second one can be faster, lower, and has a smaller diameter.

Let's start with the first example. Imagine that we have a big ball that is thrown down from a very high height - let's say it's about 7.5 feet. If we follow the formula that describes the gravitational acceleration, we can figure out that the ball will be at least 2.5 feet faster than it would be if it had been thrown straight up. Let's also assume that the ball will have a diameter of about 11 feet - this is the standard ball size. Then the formula for the gravitational acceleration (according to this formula, it would be exactly the same height but with a bigger diameter) says that the ball would have a speed that is 1.8 feet per second higher and would have a diameter that is 8 feet shorter than it would be if the same ball were thrown straight up! However, the ball would bounce off the ground much, much faster than the speed and diameter of the straight-up version - 1.8 feet per-second versus 0.5 feet per second! Because of these factors, the ball would bounce upwards and out of the way much more quickly!

Now let's compare this to the second example. If we imagine that a large ball has a diameter that is the same as in the first example, but we have a smaller and lighter ball, we can figure out the same thing. The formula for the gravitational acceleration also says that the bigger ball would be moving at least 1.3 feet per second faster than the smaller one! And since the balls are lighter, they bounce down into the ground at a much much slower speed than the ones described in the first example. Because of these factors, their trajectories will look slightly different. Here is an example (click here to see the bigger version):

Now, let's take a look at the situation where we have a larger diameter ball thrown down from a higher height - let's say it's 14 feet. The formula tells us that we are moving at a height of approximately 15 feet, while the smaller ball has a diameter of about 4 feet. Let's again make these two different balls bounce off the ground a little bit differently, so that they will appear to bounce upward for a little longer instead of downwards!

Now let's consider the situation where the larger ball is thrown down from a higher position - let's say it is 18 feet. The formula tells that we are moving at exactly the same height, but with a diameter that is almost the same as

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the theory behind how we communicate with one another through language, let's start by considering some basic concepts. You don't use the words "belief" and "cognition" when trying to communicate - you talk about what you believe (often called a "psychological theory") and about what you cognize (often called a "physical theory"). As I said in the previous chapter, people often confuse these two things because their definitions and ideas about them are often completely contradictory. But that is OK - that's where you get to have fun! You should really have fun figuring out what a "cognitive process" is and why it is useful (for example, for understanding the mind of other people), but you also shouldn't use a word as a "skill" that you can use when it suits you.

In a nutshell: language is a series of words and sentences that people communicate to each other. The "language" that you talk about includes spoken languages and written languages, which in our current world is most commonly in written form.

In this chapter we are going to explore a fairly recent method of studying language called "hip hop NLP" (hypno-linguistics), which can help you learn to talk and speak better with your friends, fellow students, colleagues, and even customers! Let's get back to the problem of how people communicate and how we communicate with one other!...

The word hypnosis refers to our ability to become deeply immersed in a state of unconscious thought - this includes meditation, deep state of relaxation, dream states, and more. These states of profound inner-awareness are the result of brain activity in various parts of the brain, including the default mode network (DMN) - or the network of brain areas that keep you focussed on the present without thinking about the future or about anything else.

This is important because the DMN is a type of brain activity that happens when we're trying to get into a deep, peaceful, meditative state of focus and awareness - and this particular state of focus can be extremely useful for communication. The key to communicating better is to have an active dialogue with people that are "like-minded": that is, individuals who share a particular mental outlook and who have common points of view. In other words, we want to keep in touch with people that have the same philosophical outlooks and values as we do. In this way, we'll be able to communicate better with those people, which will help us grow as a professional in the future.

Hip-hop NLP offers a very interesting method of communicating better with people. It offers a new approach to listening, by combining our own inner understanding of language with some very basic concepts of listening. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, learning how to listen to conversations is a key skill we need to develop to communicate better! But, as with other listening skills, there is also a need to practice listening and to practice listening to other people's speech! When listening to someone else's speech, do you focus just on the words they're saying, as if you're trying to learn their language? Do you also hear all of the other details in their speech (like how they say certain words, the way they use the language, and the intonation of their speech)? Do you listen to what people say in order to understand what they mean (and make sense of what they mean)? Do you pay attention to their emotions when they talk (even though they're not physically present at the moment)? In all of these cases, listening to our own speech will help us communicate better with people, and it's a skill that should be developed as an essential skill for people to master in their future lives.

What you can do when you want to make a better communication with someone is to listen attentively to their speech, and at the same time pay attention to their body language and facial expressions. Once you master these strategies, you'll have an increased chance of getting a better understanding of what you're trying to say to your interlocutor! You should also practice using your body language and facial expressions to communicate with people so that your brain will be able to automatically make connections between what you are saying and the body language you're using to convey it. And it will be much easier to make these connections when you use your own body language to communicate because it feels natural, and your body language will be consistent with your voice!

But there are many times in our everyday lives when we're not listening attentively to what someone says, or when we focus just on the words of our interlocutors' speech, or we don't pay enough attention to the body language. In these times, the best way to solve this problem is to practice how to communicate better, and by doing so, you'll gain the ability to listen more attentively and pay more attention to the body language of people.

In addition to listening, we can also use speech understanding techniques such as "body language and facial expressions awareness" (BFA) to help us understand what people are saying. BFA is a type of speech understanding technique that uses our inner feeling of what we're feeling, or what we think is happening inside of us, to communicate with other people. In other words, BFA uses our inner feeling of what's happening inside of us to communicate with people. As we mentioned earlier, we have to practice how to communicate well by doing so, so we can practice BFA at home with our family and friends. And you should also practice this technique in class because you'll know exactly how to make BFA more effective. And practice listening to other people will also help you practice BFA more effectively, as well as practicing it will give you an opportunity to communicate with other people (especially those who are close to you) in a more direct and personal manner.

As an aside, I've also learned about "body language and facial expression awareness" (BFA), an interesting speech understanding technique that uses inner feeling of what's happening in the body to communicate with people. In other words it's a type of speech understanding which uses our inner feeling of being in the body of our interlocutor to communicate with people. It's a very important speech understanding technique, but it's often neglected. It's one that people can get really good at, but it's often neglected in the classroom and at home, and that's where BFA can offer a great benefit to anyone who is interested in communication.

So we've talked about listening to the person you're trying to communicate with, paying attention to how they use words, paying attention to their body language, paying attention to their emotions as well as paying attention to the intonation of the person you're talking to. In this way, you can increase your chances of getting the best communication possible! It's important to understand that if you want to improve the quality of your speech, it's important to learn how to communicate better!

In the previous chapter I talked about an important speech understanding technique called "body language and facial expressiveness" (BFA). This speech understanding technique uses our inner feeling of how things are in the body, or what we think the person is feeling, to communicate with other humans. In this chapter I want to discuss an interesting speech understanding technique called "behavioral intelligence" (BI). In this chapter, I want to introduce two methods of studying BI: "autobiographical memory" and "behavioral cognition" (BC). As I said earlier, BI is a form of BI that uses

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the question remains, "is it possible for two identical and identical systems to undergo any type of continuous, reversible change?" The answer to that question is "yes," but only if one of the systems has a homeomorphism. The next paragraph will provide some more detail on the concept of homeomorphism and how it relates to continuous, reversible changes.

The notion of a homeomorphism is very similar to a generalization of the notion of an isomorphism - you can say that two maps f and g are homeomorphisms if and only if they are identical but also completely different. So a two dimensional map f will always be an isomorphism, while a three dimensional map f will always have a homeomorphism defined around its 3-dimensionally defined center. In fact, every continuous, linear, bijective map between two finite dimensional spaces is a homeomorphism.

However, homeomorphisms are only related to the underlying topology of a set. In fact, this topology determines only whether or not a map between spaces is homotopic or continuous! Every homeomorphism - except possibly the identity - is the identity! That is, every homeomorphism is the identity: f • g = g • f = f. However, this is not always true. In fact, there exist two distinct 3+1 dimensional continua, one of which is homeomorphic to the other, but not the other - this is called a homotopy from one 3+1 dimensional continuum to the other! This type of homotopy has been studied by an infinite number of mathematicians for many decades. However, despite such extensive efforts and the numerous mathematical techniques that exist, there is still no definitive answer to the question of which continuous, invertible maps between 2+1 dimensional continua are homotopic to the identity. The answer depends on what you define to be homeomorphism.

So let us focus on the fact that we can define a homeomorphism between any two 3+1 dimensional continua. This map can be thought of as two maps that "cut out" each 3-dimensionally defined portion of the continuum into two 2+1 dimensional continua. Then these two continua are each homeomorphic to their own original 3+1 dimensional continua and are referred to as the images of their respective 3+1 dimensional continua! A particular image of a 3+1 dimensional continuum is called a basepoint and the basepoint is always the same. In this way, there is a one-to-one correspondence between homeomorphisms and homeomorphisms that map the same basepoint to the same basepoint, called a homotopy from the original 3+1 dimensional continuum to itself!

However, we cannot assume that our two images of the same continuum are the same - this is because of the difference in scale of the two images. The images of 3+1 dimensional continua can be represented using higher order polynomials. The idea here is that the scale at the intersection of two 3+1 dimensional continua increases by a factor of n for each of their successive common coordinates. In other words, a three dimensional continuum of points is always two to three times as tall as its corresponding image (because of the difference in scale between the two images). When we compare the two images at each point of the continuum, we will see the difference between the two images increases by a similar factor for each of the subsequent common coordinates. This is why the two images at each of our points cannot be the same!

The most important and surprising result is that we can only assume that our two images are the same up to some continuous, invertible, homomorphic mapping that preserves the underlying geometry of our continuum - we will refer to this map as the homotopy of the images of the same continuum, or Hif - because this is a generalization of the idea of a homeomorphism between continua...

So how do we prove this? Well, we can prove this by using homotopy theory! Homotopy theory is a mathematical technique that seeks to find a continuous homomorphic mapping from two space-like continua into another space-like continuum without necessarily being the identity! It was invented by an unknown mathematician called Jacob Riema in the 1950s. It has since been very successful in proving a multitude of interesting mathematical statements, such as the uniqueness theorem. More recently, it has been used to prove a variety of other results - a good introduction to homotopy theory can be found at the end of this book!

The important part of homotopy theory is that the maps being studied must be continuous (meaning that they must preserve the topology of the underlying space) - this is the reason why it is often necessary to study homomorphisms that are continuous!

But how do we define such a continuous, invertible homomorphic mapping between two spaces? Well simply put, the simplest way to define a continuous homomorphic mapping is to take the identity on one continuous space and apply it to a continuous map to another continuous space - the result of this process is called the identity map. There is however another way to define a continuous map: the definition of a continuous homomorphism involves two conditions: continuity at each point and associativity. Continuity requires that for each value of x in the original space, there is a value of y in the new space that maps to x as well. Associativity then requires that for each value x in the first space, there is a unique value y in the second space that maps to x (these two values can both be the same)! The reason for these two conditions is to ensure that there is a unique homomorphic mapping between the two spaces - this map will map x to y if x = y and it will map y to x if x ≠ y. Of course, there are also certain other conditions for continuous homomorphisms that make this definition more rigorous - the key to being able to find a continuous, invertible homomorphism between two spaces is to find such mappings that do not have any isolated points!

But how do we determine that there are no isolated points? Well, there are two ways to do this - one is to find all continuous maps from a given continuous space to a given other continuous space that have isolated points. Of course, there is only a finite number of continuous maps from a continuous space to a given space that have no isolated points - there are some other continuous maps that have isolated points, but those other continuous maps must have been "introduced" by some continuous mapping from a previous space to the current space (that is, those other continuous maps must contain some mapping from the previous space to the current one.) A second possibility would be to search for maps that map isolated points back to themselves; that is, such a continuous mapping is called an isometry!

Now let us examine the concept of isometry. If a map between two spaces has isolated points, that means that there is a unique continuous, invertible, and unique homomorphism between the two spaces! In other words, a map that maps isolated points back to themselves must be an isometry and so this map must necessarily be an isometry! In other words, there is an isometry from one space to the other - this is why the identity is always an isometry! Now let's come to our question: what is a homotopy from the one 3+1 dimensional continuum (represented by a basepoint) to the other continuum? Well simply put, a continuous homomorphic mapping that maps the same basepoint to itself must be an isometry, meaning that there is a homotopy from one continuous 3+1 dimensional continuum to another continuous 3+1 dimensional continuum! This is the

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the different aspects that are used to make a good game, I'll start by going over the three essential dimensions of game design: player, game world, and environment.

The player - the player is the individual being who plays the game. It's usually represented by a character, but in this book we'll be talking primarily about a virtual character. The main goal of the player is to earn money (sometimes even more) through playing a game. The two main options for a player are to play through a game by making purchases, or to play through the game by doing things themselves, such as learning new things.

The game world - the game world describes the world our player has created in the game world. It is essentially like the world that we are living in, except we are playing instead. The player usually decides which areas of the game world they want to explore. If they want to start a world, they'll have to choose it from a list of world areas. If they have a character, the game world will describe all the objects that they can interact with, such as interacting with the NPC in the story (or even the characters themselves).
The environment - the environment is everything surrounding the world that players interact with. These include buildings, creatures, resources, and so forth, and they are all part of the game world, but they don't describe it - the game world is in itself part of the player's game world!

There are also other parts of the game world that aren't entirely game worlds - in particular, there are certain resources that are not real. A resource is something that can be harvested by a player, but it isn't real. A creature is something that will turn into a player's own creature in the game world. For example, you can buy a creature, and it will turn into a person, or you can train an animal to become your own pet in the game world. If an environment is set up, the player can use the objects and resources in that environment to make things happen - you can craft items or craft resources for use in your own game world. You can also create other creatures in the game world - you can breed creatures to produce new creatures in your game world.

Basically, the environment is all of the things that a player can interact with in the game world, except what the game world itself describes. There are also some other parts of the game that aren't part of a game world, such as the NPCs in the story or any other creatures in the game.

One of the key parts of game design is how the game world is structured so that all of the different kinds of objects and creatures in the game can interact with each other and each other's resources in the game world.

Another key part of game design is how players interact with the game world. In the next chapter we'll get to the concept of "honest game design", and I'll talk about how we can make good games without a lot of fuss.

Chapter Thirty Seven
Character Creation

As we've learned in Chapter One, we are all created with certain abilities and limitations, and we can use those things to create other people! Each of us has our own unique personalities, and we can combine those personalities to create characters to interact with in our games.

Character creation is what makes up the core of game design. As with any other aspect of game design, we need to take care to create characters that are the best possible representation of the person we would like to create them as. But what do we really mean by "character" and "character creation"? How do we decide what we should create?

We often see characters as people from our games - or at least as the main character or main character from the main plot in the story. If you go back to the video game industry, there are a variety of genres and subgenres that have a distinct look and feel - for example, RPGs come in a variety of styles and have very different animations, or in the case of Dungeons and Dragons, there are many types of different monsters! And if we really want to create a character, it's very important that the player has a good understanding of what the character looks like before they start creating it.

Character creation in the gaming industry generally involves three main elements: choosing a character style, choosing a world that the character will be in, and choosing a storyline for the character to meet in the game world. Here are some of the major guidelines for deciding what style a character should have:

Style - it can be a character design style, or it could be a generic, non-specific character design style. Basically, you want the character to look something that represents a particular kind of personality.

World - you want the character to live in a world that reflects the characters personality well enough so that when you look at them in a game, you have a good idea what to expect. Sometimes the world will be a game-specific world, sometimes the world will be something different that will be similar to some of the game's worlds, and sometimes the world will be random.

Storyline - here we take character creation a little further into its details. We often get stuck trying to find a storyline for characters that isn't completely clear and is hard to follow for the reader. As we talk about in Chapter Three, when a storyline is good, we can usually tell a story without making the reader feel like they are looking for the truth of some plot hole. The storyline should be short, and it should be set in a setting that the reader knows and is familiar with. The plot should give the reader an idea of what happens in the story, but it should not be difficult to follow and shouldn't give the reader a hard time in reading.

In game design, we need characters that are completely different from each other, but that fit the style of the game. This is a big part of being able to build up a character that is so unique that it can fit seamlessly within the game. There are some rules that govern how many similar characters you can have together in one game, but that doesn't mean the characters will have the same appearance. For example, it may be very hard to create a character with a character style that matches the style of two characters that already exist, but if they both have a character style that matches another character style, the two characters will have some similarities in their appearance.

So if you have a character that fits some of the character requirements of the game, but is different from all of the other characters that already exist in the game, then you can combine that character into a new one. This process is called "character creation" in the gaming industry.

Chapter Thirty Eight
Characterization

When a character is created, it is created in many ways. You can add things to it, edit things about it, and even create new characters using the created characters. It is important to consider how a character is created as the character becomes part of the game, and how this will affect the game's storyline and the interaction between characters.

The Character Creation Guide

In Chapter One, we talked about how the character is created - what characteristics and abilities a character has - and how the character is used in the game. The character creation guide is the final part of the character creation process. For each character in the game, the character creator creates a character profile

To better depict the idea of how a deity might affect another deity, consider the following situation. Imagine a god is in the world and decides to make an attempt at communicating with an evil demigod. The god, without knowing who the demigod is, would naturally choose an intelligent and well educated, intelligent demigod over a less intelligent demigod.

Now, it is very common for people to have a "weird" dream during which they have a strange or bizarre thought or idea that, once we try to make sense of it, we discover it is absurd in a way that we never thought possible. Some people even have this very common type of dream, where they literally just fall asleep when they do, waking up the next morning with a completely new thought that they would have never thought possible!

Some people have the same dream, but they are unable to make sense of it. Instead, they just wake up very, very sleepy, only to be greeted by the start of a new day - where again, nothing actually changed in the dream! Sometimes people who have this dream also report waking up in a completely different place to their current location. It can even happen to them in the same place where they were supposed to be - all in a very surreal dream!

In our world, the only way we could make an intelligent, well educated deity speak to an uneducated, less educated deity is if we were to make them communicate with each other and they could also send intelligent, educated deities to other levels of being. This would not only allow us to communicate with other intelligent being like gods/deities, but also allow us to make friends with other intelligent being in our world - even if they are far from us in some very unrealistic way!

So what does all this mean for the human race? Well, this is where mathematics comes in! Using our mathematical tools, we can figure out a mathematical formula that describes the interactions between a deity and its interlocutor, without needing any of the usual assumptions and assumptions we would usually make in physics. Of course, as we are able to work with the mathematical formulas that describe how the deities influence each other, we need to also have some understanding of mathematics!

This way, we would be able to explain a wide range of phenomena that have gone unexplained in the past, such as why we don't know what happens to the universe once the universes terminate...or whether we are eternal...or if there is a god in our universe...or even whether we are immortal. In short, we would be able to:

Explain the way gods/deities influence each other...
Explain some aspects of human immortality...
Explain how the universes terminate...
Explain the events that go on in the dark ages, etc.

Here are a few of the concepts we need to be familiar with:

P = number of dimensions
Q = dimension of the higher-dimensional universe being described (not necessarily equal to the native dimension of the lower-dimensional universe being described)
E = energy density
n = number of dimensions in the higher-dimensional universe being studied
M = mass density in the higher-dimensional universe
K = constant of gravitation in the higher-dimensional universe

In all of these figures below, we've just simplified to make them more understandable.

Note: Some equations may be very complex - but there are many examples out there explaining this concept in much more plain terms. For example, these figures describe how a single deity influences a higher-dimensional deity on a smaller scale, while this higher-dimensional deity influences a higherdimensional deity on a smaller and smaller scale, etc. If you ever have any questions about a particular concept, just check out the original diagram from which you came, and look up the concepts you were struggling with!

In short, the first thing you need to do is figure out how the higher-dimensional deity is going to interact with the lower-dimensional deity (in other words, what is the equation describing how the higher-dimensional deities influence each other). Then you should figure out how many dimensions the higher-dimensional deity has in the universe at the moment it is interacting with the lower-dimensional deity; and finally, you should figure out how much energy the higher-dimensional deity should be in the universe to interact effectively with the lower-dimensional deities. By this point, you'll have an idea about how to calculate the constants of gravitation, and you will know the amount of mass in the higher-dimensional universe that the higher-dimensional deity can interact with effectively (these masses are also given by the equation in the second paragraph above!).

In other words, this chapter is for anybody who wants to know how mathematics might be used to explain various aspects of life in our Universe.  It's possible that even you never really considered what could happen to your life and the way it might change when you enter into the real world...and all of these changes can be explained using the mathematics that you studied in this chapter!

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how INFP people function in their everyday life, we will be using mathematics. INFP people are naturally good at math; they have a high score on the ability to solve equations and apply basic mathematical principles to solve real-world problems.

Imagine taking a math class! You would be assigned a workbook and a teacher. As you worked your way through the problems, you would be able to work through the same material from the beginning and the end - and the problem would end with you having learned how to solve the problem yourself! This is very similar to solving problems in real life! As you progress through a course, your ability to solve more problems will build - until you reach a point where your solution to the problem is so perfect, that it actually tells you how the problem was to begin with.

As you progress through math classes, your ability to apply basic mathematical principles will naturally build - so you will solve problems more naturally. As you become more proficient at math, you will notice that you are less affected by certain things you didn't expect - things like what you are doing at the time, what you are trying to do, or how complicated the problem is!

One way to use math to better understand INFP people is to use some of the fundamental principles it uses - such as conservation of energy and momentum and the laws of motion. We will first discuss some concepts regarding conservation of energy and momentum, before diving into the more detailed physics of the laws of motion.

Energy is the kinetic energy of an object - it is caused by the movement of a particle and can be measured by using some simple formula. For example, in a well-tested experiment, we can measure the amount of energy that a basketball has lost due to its upward motion after hitting a wall. The energy stored in the basketball is equivalent to the kinetic energy of the basketball! However, it is also important to note that if the basketball starts with zero kinetic energy, then we will never be able to measure its energy, as the energy lost by the ball due to the wall can never be found!

One concept that we are going to discuss here is conservation of energy. Conservation of energy tells us that when an object has no work to do, then it will remain as is. If the object is a ball of air, its energy would be zero; it can't exert any force on anything in the surrounding. So at all times, the ball will remain at rest!

Similarly, if an object has no momentum, then we would have to say it is not moving! If an object has zero momentum, then all of its momentum would have been absorbed by the surrounding object - it will move very very slowly and be at rest! If we want to understand INFP people in the most general sense, we need to take this as our definition of INFP - this is why it's important to understand what it means to be an INFP person...otherwise we will be lost!

One more thing about conservation of energy is that if you take a very simple object and add an amount of energy into it, then it will eventually return to its original configuration - if the energy is added at an incredibly high rate - the amount of energy stored in the object will quickly become so great that it cannot be returned to its original configuration!

Of course, when it comes to more complicated objects, we would need to go into a lot of detail and apply a lot of physics to explain how it works. For example, it would take a lot of physics to understand how a balloon of air can become a spinning ball of energy - if you are allowed to add and subtract energy from the balloon, you would eventually get to a spinning ball of nothingness...and if you wanted to study the physics of the balloon from the beginning, you would be left with a bunch of empty equations!

One other thing we are going to discuss in this chapter is conservation of momentum - and for those of you unfamiliar with conservation of momentum, it's an important concept in all sorts of physics! Conservation of momentum states that momentum is conserved in any system where forces act upon it (including our bodies) and where mass can be placed on one side of a system but can not be moved on the other side of the same system! Conservation of momentum also tells us that mass moves with the particle in which it is placed, and so things such as an ice cube and an apple will both move in the same direction (in our 3+1 dimensional world, the direction of the apple would be upwards and that of the ice cube would be downwards, but in other dimensions, that would be reversed).

To help you understand how we can best use this in our everyday lives, we will be going through some elementary concepts! First we will look at conservation of energy - and what it means when an object has energy left over. Then we will go into the more detailed laws of motion that allow us to understand how momentum is conserved - and how it allows us to calculate how much energy we have left over in our system before we begin to lose it...which would happen very quickly! Lastly, we will look at the important concept of momentum conservation - and how it allows you to calculate how much momentum is left in your system before we begin to experience time dilation! How could we gain or lose momentum as we move through time?

If we use these concepts, we will be able to answer a few basic questions about how INFP people function - and how they interact with others! As you can see, there is a lot to understand about these concepts, so we recommend reading through chapter one and all of the other chapters before taking up this course!


Chapter Thirty Seven

Dualism, Truth, and Reality Mathematics

A lot of the mathematics in this chapter will revolve around the concepts of dualism, truth, and reality. These concepts are fundamental to science, which requires us to come up with new ways to think about our world and our scientific theories, all based upon our own individual perceptions. In mathematical terms, these concepts are called mathematical theories and they represent generalizations of known truths about what reality is (e.g., everything must be created, no more, nothing less).

The dualist view, according to which all things in existence must exist in two distinct, irreducibly related and mutually exclusive entities, is commonly called deism. In deism, the world is viewed as composed of a subject world, which is a realm in our own minds, and an object world, which is real and actual world outside of our minds.

Many scientists have held the dualist view since Newtonian physics began. However, there is also a deistic viewpoint that holds that the world is composed of two different realms: the subject world, which is our own mind, and the object world, which is reality outside of our minds. The subject world contains all of the physical and chemical processes that create, transform and destroy all matter, whereas the object world contains all of the laws of nature that govern physics, chemistry, and biology. The relationship between the two is called the duality of physics.
The dualist viewpoint is an alternative to the deistic viewpoint, but it has some common points with it. In deism the objects are created and destroyed by events in the subject world - whereas in the dualist view, events occurring in the subject world only create objects, but the events are not actually happening in

To better depict mathematics, and its application in different domains of life, a popular analogy is that of chess. Mathematicians think of chess pieces as vertices in a grid (or board); the players represent the pixels on the board. You can assume that there is some sort of logic involved in the placement of the pieces on the board, which allows for the creation of an orderly game. Mathematicians believe that this orderly game is the result of a mathematical law. Below you'll find a description of the basic concepts of chess and their relationship to mathematics.

A:

You need to have a clear understanding of basic ideas of Geometry.  Here is a short introduction with an example - a box with the sides length of 5 meters (one meter would be 10 x 10 cm = 5 cm) and height of 6 meters (one meter would actually be 10 x 6 cm = 6 cm).  
You think this box has the volume of 600 cm^3. You can use the geometry to calculate the weight of this box, but before doing that, you need to understand the volume. 
The volume of the box is  60 x 5 x 6 = 600 x 6 = 600 x 10 x 10 = 600 x 10 x 60 = 600 x 10 x 600 = 600 x 600 = 600 x 10 x 610 = 600 x 60 x 610 = 600 x 600 x 610 = 600 x 610 x 60 x 610 = 610 x 600 x 60 x 610 x 610 = 610 x 6000 x 600 x 600 = 610 x 6000 x 6 = 610 x 6000 x 10 x 6 = 610 x 6 x 10 = 610 x 6 x 600 x 6 = 610 x 10 x 6 x 600 x 600 = 600 = 600 x 610 x 610 x 60 x 6 = 6 x 6 x 6 x 600 x x600 = 10 x 10 x 6 x 60 x 60 x 60 = 60 x 60 x 6 x 610 x 610 x 610 = 60 x 610 x 600 x 60 = 60 x 6 x 6 x 610 = 60 x 6 x 600 = 600 = 610 x 610 = 60

We can use this same formula to calculate the weight of another box - this time with a height of 1 meter and length of 5 meters. We use 6 x 5 x 6 = 10 x 10 = 10 x 610 = 600 = 60 x 600 x 610 = 610 x 610 = 610

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the differences between different kinds of people and the different types of activities they engage in, we often refer to persons as "intrapersonal cognitivists" and the various aspects of their lives as "intrapersonal functions." For example, one might consider an athlete, a parent, a student, or a professional athlete. Of these, the athlete is most directly concerned with the outcome of his or her sport, whereas the parent, student, and professional athlete are more concerned with learning and gaining knowledge about his or her sport. The purpose of this chapter is to describe how one can use the concept of dimension in mathematical modeling to understand different kinds of processes that are characteristic to each of these three intrapersonal functions, and the implications of these insights for improving future research in intrapersonal cognition.

The first thing to discuss is how one can make use of the concept of dimension to understand which processes are best modeled using one particular math model.

To understand intrapersonal cognition in more detail, consider what is an "intrapersonal process"? Intrapersonal processes are, in most cases, the mental processes that happen in the mind of a person when engaging in a certain activity. For example, to describe an athlete, we might use the terms "goal oriented thinking," "self-paced learning," and "self-directed learning" to describe the mental processes that happen when the athlete is thinking about his or her sport, learning about it, and making progress with that sport.

Next, let's discuss some math models that are helpful in understanding the concepts of different intrapersonal functions.

As we can see from the above table, most of the math models that are useful for understanding different intrapersonal functions share many of the same characteristics, such as the need for both positive and negative feedback, and for feedback to help an activity to continue. However, while these models all have similar properties, they each have their own advantages and disadvantages.

A good example of one model that can provide us with important details about a certain type of behavior is the Reinforcement Learning Model. In this model, people are given a choice between different options, each of which has a certain reward and associated punishments. Some options, such as choosing the yellow stick because it earns you a lot of money, don't have any associated punishments; instead they receive the full amount of reward for their choice. Other options, such as choosing to play with a red stick, have a certain amount of punishment but only receive a limited amount of reward. People then use this model to make decisions by trying out different choices in different situations.

Now let's briefly describe this model.

As stated in the preceding chapter, if we use mathematics to explain the different kinds of activities people engage in, it becomes clear that there are three types of mathematical models:

Model 1: Mathematically-Expressible Functions
Model 2: Simple Linear Temporal State Processes
Model 3: Reinforcement Learning Models

Now what are the two differences between these three models? Let's do a quick comparison between the two most commonly used models, the Reinforcement Learning Model and the Simple Linear Temporal State Process Model.

The first thing we can notice is that Reinforcement Learning Models are more complicated than simple linear temporal state processes, but they have exactly the same mathematical structure and similar properties. Additionally, Reinforcement Learning Models have more flexibility in how they handle the two types of feedback that are present in these models, which makes it easier to incorporate the three types of feedback that are actually happening in the real world!

The second thing that we notice is that Reinforcement learning models handle the two types of external and internal feedback that are present in simple linear temporal state processes more accurately than do simple linear temporal state processes. Simply put, in simple linear temporal state models, people always end up on the same side of the state machine because a reward or a punishment doesn't get to them until the last action of the state machine. However, Reinforcement Learning models handle feedback in a more accurate way - people can decide how to apply the reward they receive from their choices. The choice is theirs to make, but it's the machine that just has to make a decision!

To further illustrate how complex models can describe complex behaviors, consider the example that we discussed above about the athlete. For this particular example, Reinforcement Learning Models are a good choice because they provide a very good description of the type of behavior a typical athlete would take. For example, it would be impossible for the athlete to be happy or satisfied when playing football, because the reward is not very high (not enough to make the play count) and the punishment is not very low (not enough to make him or her dislike the sport). So while the athlete's choices might be a combination of positive and negative feedback, it's important for him or her to work through the whole situation before deciding which action to take. The point of this is to understand that it's always your decision to make and it is always important to use good decision making skills.
Now let's consider an example of a mathematical model that can describe an aspect of the athlete's behavior better than either Reinforcement Learning Model or the Simple Linear Temporal State Model.

This model is called the Self-Organized Map Model (SOM Model). It combines the concepts of the Simple Linear Temporal State State Process Model with some ideas from the Reinforcement Learning Model to describe the type of decision-making behavior a typical athlete takes.

To see how this model would describe the process of decision-making, consider two kinds of behavior that athletes might take. One kind of behavior is called "preparation." In this case, the athlete focuses on preparing himself or herself for the game. During this step of the process, the athlete makes sure he or she is properly hydrated, has a nice clothes on, and knows how to perform all of the skills he or she needs to perform in order to be successful. In addition to being mentally prepared, the athlete also has a certain amount of skill on his or her team's possession - something that he or she knows how to use, and which will help the team in winning the game! Of course, there is no sense to performing a skill if the other team doesn't use it - the other team wins the game just by winning the possession! So preparing for a game is about putting in a lot of work, but it is not about getting as good as the other team!

The second kind of behavior that an athlete might take is called "gameplay" or "team play." In this type of behavior, the team is a cohesive group of players that all play in the same way, with the same focus. In these kinds of games, the only thing that needs to happen is to move to the next area of the stage so that other teams can start working on their own. If one team has a better team play than the other team, then the first team will win the game - the team with the better team play wins the game. The first team gets the win because the first team has all of the team's skills and knowledge, and thus will win the game. In short, team play is a combination of all three of these types of behaviors, all of which need to occur in order for the team to win. Because team play is the basis for any of these three types of behavior, it

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our own minds and explain why mathematicians are such fascinating people, I'm going to explore some of the cognitive abilities (the abilities to understand, reason, and judge) we have, and also use some of the mathematics to explain how people think and reason about math in real life.

Let's start by discussing some definitions. Let's call a person's mathematical mind "mathematics" or "math." And let's call a person's ability to understand math "mathematikos." In my own experience as a teacher, my students often use these terms interchangeably, but I would strongly advise against that practice.  Let's look at three examples for what I'm talking about:

Mathematics is the science of numbers and of calculation
Mathematikos is the ability to understand mathematics
Mathematikos also involves thinking mathematically

Let's make this clear and move on! In order for us to understand math, we need to understand what number theory and algebra are.  Let's also see the importance of these ideas for understanding mathematics in general!

Number Theory
Let me begin by giving some math terminology. This is all purely symbolic and is, perhaps, a little over my head for a beginner, but it is important for us to have a better understanding of the concept.

Basic Algebraic Notions
The definition of basic algebra in modern-day mathematics is essentially a mathematical term that describes how to think about and manipulate numbers.  Basically, basic algebra is the fundamental tools used to understand the properties of numbers, and, in particular, to create mathematical objects such as mathematical functions and mathematical functions of mathematical objects.
In basic algebra, we use the three basic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication to create a series of mathematical functions that we can use in more complicated situations, including mathematical functions of numbers and mathematical functions of mathematical expressions.

This is a simple algebra exercise that we'll be discussing in more detail in Chapter One, and we can easily visualize it using a graph that we'll define in Chapter Three.

Mathematical Functions
Now let's look at a very specific type of mathematical object - the mathematical function. Let's do this by visualizing mathematical functions by drawing a function graph in a simple manner.  In this example, we'll draw a function graph for the standard addition operation, or simply add - just as we might draw a graph of a graph, a function graph for addition would be a simple line with four lines. Now imagine that we can draw a graph for any other operation, as long as the function graph is a line! Let's take a moment to discuss some basic mathematical concepts that we'll use below as we look at mathematical functions:

We already mentioned that addition is defined by adding a single positive or negative number to a single other number.  Let's take this example again and define addition by drawing a graph of the addition operation.

We also see that this simple addition operation - add - can produce negative numbers as well as positive numbers! Let's take this simple addition example again - and now let's define multiplication as the addition of two negative or positive numbers and a single number.
Let's consider this again and take a moment to understand how we can define multiplication by drawing the graph for multiplication. 

Mathematical Functions that Repeate
In addition to the addition and multiplication operations described above, we can also consider the addition and multiplication operations that repeat - so for example, we might ask why we can multiply two numbers by themselves multiple times. Let's consider this again and take advantage of this new ability.

In addition to adding two negative numbers repeatedly, we can also multiply numbers with negative numbers in addition, so for example we can multiply one negative number by another negative number.

In order for us to understand why we can multiply two negative numbers repeatedly, let's consider a few more basic mathematical concepts that we'll be using below as we look at the multiply operations.

Subtraction
The basic operations of subtraction are the same as the multiplication operations described above, except that we are only allowed to subtract two numbers instead of adding two numbers.
Let's take this example again and imagine that we can subtract one negative number by one positive number multiple times, as long as we know the positive and negative numbers.  Let's take this simple example again and define subtraction as the sum of a negative number and a positive number.

Multiplication
Now let's look at multiplication! There are three different types of multiplication operations - addition, multiplication, and division.
Let's take this simple example again - and now we can define multiplication as the product of two positive or negative numbers and a single number.

Multiplication is also commonly referred to as the addition of positive or negative numbers multiplied by a single positive or negative element.  Let's take this example to demonstrate this:

Let's return to our previous example and consider the multiplication of two numbers that represent negative numbers - let's write them as -3 and 2.

In addition, multiplying two negative numbers by a negative number is also called subtraction (ie. -2 subtracts -2). Let's take this example again to demonstrate this.

Now let's take a moment to explain how we can multiply two positive numbers and a positive number. Let's go back to our previous example and imagine that we can multiply the two negative numbers by the positive number.

Again, this is something that we'll be using in Chapter One!

As we understand this multiplication operation, the product operation consists of adding two numbers multiplied together (eg. -4 + 3), subtraction of the negative number from the two positive numbers (eg. -4 - 3), and multiplication of the two positive numbers multiplied together (eg. (+4) * 3).  Let's look at this in more detail using some basic mathematical concepts.

Division
Division is another important concept - we can divide one number by another number, and we can also divide a number by itself. Let's take this simple example to demonstrate this concept - and now let's see the division of an integer by itself:

Let's also consider the division of an integer number by itself and take a moment to visualize this operation:

Now we have a basic idea of division by dividing a single number by itself. Let's go back to the simple example in the previous paragraph to demonstrate how we can divide any number by itself - but how could we divide 3 by 7? Let's take a moment to visualise this operation:

In order to do this, we simply write the integer as a fraction (in this example, 3/8 = 1/8).
Let's repeat this example to show us how to divide 3 by 7 using our basic division algorithm:

For this example, we simply write 3 / 7 = 1.7.  Let's take a moment to go back to the graph to visualize this operation in detail:

And finally, we know how to perform the division operation using the basic division algorithm:

Now it's up to us to demonstrate how we can perform the division operation using our basic division algorithm.

We can divide 7 by 1.7 = 1.37 using the basic division algorithm to calculate 1.37 and using the following basic division algorithm:

In general, it's fairly simple - the main difference between this basic division algorithm and the more complicated division algorithm is the addition that we can do with our own numbers using multiplication.

Mathematics Mathematikos
Now let's look at some basic basic math operations that we'll use to understand basic mathematics, such as algebra, addition and subtraction.

Number Theory
Let's look at some basic concepts:

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts and relationships of mathematics and ISFP, we will use the following four figures:
Figure 1. (A) The ISFP concept map.
Figure 2. (B) The ISFP mathematical concept map.
Figure 3. (C) The ISFP computational algorithm map.
Figure 4. (D) The ISFP knowledge and skill system map

Figure 1 provides a brief introduction to our new mathematical language and its core concepts - the ISFP mathematical concept map. We can see that each concept (A, B, C and D in Figure 1 ) contains a few arrows representing various aspects of this concept, which in turn provides a bit of background information about what it means to use those concepts in practice. Below we have provided some definitions of our key concepts.

Concept:
The concept is defined as the meaning that the user makes of a given concept using mathematics. The term is used interchangeably with the concept itself, and is therefore not strictly limited to mathematical concepts. For example, "calculus" or "algebra" would be two different ways of talking about a single concept, but one of these would include the other.
Concept:
The concept of a set is defined as a set of elements that are all related together. This concept is often expressed in the form: "This set contains: X, Y, Z". This phrase is not very well known, and is often used to express something else, such as "A set contains: the elements of X and the elements of Y" or "A set contains only the elements: a, b, and c". For example, a definition of "complete" sets as follows: "A set is complete if it is complete for every subset of that set."
Mathematical Concept:
The mathematical concept is defined as the mathematical term that refers to the concept of a set of elements of a given mathematics. For example, there are many different mathematical terms that can be used to refer to the concept of an array of numbers. These concepts, sometimes referred to as equations, are used in many areas of mathematics, such as algebra, calculus, etc. Here is an example of the mathematics term "array":
An Array = <X, Y, Z, M> where X, Y and Z are numerical arrays, while M is a numerical value.
Computational Algorithm:
The computational algorithm is defined as a set containing the steps to be taken to generate a given function, usually in computer programming.
Computational Algorithm: The algorithmic concept is defined as a set that contains information about the steps to be taken from the initial set of input data to output, usually in computer programming.

Figure 2 provides a concept map for ISFP, providing information about the concepts and relationships of the ISFP mathematics language and its core concepts. We can see that there are several ISFP mathematics concepts that are common to both mathematics and ISFP: data type, basic mathematical operations, arrays and loops, data structures, recursion, and mathematical functions.

Figure 3 depicts a concept map for ISF P's cognitive functions - cognitive abilities. For instance, the cognitive function "mathematical problem solving" can be expressed using the mathematics concepts "array", "set", "difference and multiply", "probability", and "statistics". The main elements of the cognitive function "mathematics" can be seen in this figure. The cognitive functions "mathematics" and "mathematic problem solving" are not in any way equivalent.
Figure 4 demonstrates a concept map for ISP's mathematical knowledge and skill system. Each of the ISP's cognitive function has a corresponding knowledge and skill system, which contains definitions and examples of various mathematical concepts. The concepts in each cognitive function are defined by the corresponding set of knowledge and skill system, whereas some of the mathematical concepts are shared between each of these cognitive functions. For example, in the cognitive function "mathematics problem solving", there are several mathematical concepts like "array", "set," "difference and multiply," "probability," and "statistics".
We can see the important role mathematics plays in the ISFP cognitive functions. Mathematicians are very aware of the importance of mathematics in modern society, both for developing their own skills and to develop society's skills. To understand and predict the behavior and movement of particles in four different dimensions requires understanding the role of mathematics in our daily lives. This is a relatively new area of research, but there are many important contributions that we will discuss in the next few chapters.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of a deity, let's start by going over the concept of the God. This is a concept that's always been at the forefront of many religions throughout history. As we discuss in this chapter, we must consider the very existence of God and how he behaves under various situations.

God is a personal figure of the creator of the universe. He is the source of power and the beginning of creation. He is the ultimate master of creation. And the more we study the universe, the more we must admit that there is something at the very root of every universe, just waiting to be revealed!

However, at the same time, there are many other people who are considered to be God, or at least have some sort of relation to God. Let's give a brief look at some of these other possible deities:

The Almighty (in English):
God is also sometimes referred to as the Almighty, or God the Father. This name is given to many different figures, but the first person to be referred to as such is Jesus Christ! In Jewish Judaism, the word for Almighty is Kether (pronounced Keed) which is also written as Kekeh. In Hebrew, the word for creator is Geder which means to create. In Greek the word for creator is Kratos, or the One Who Creates. In the Quran, the word for creator (Allah) is translated as Ghouta which means The Lord. In Christianity, the word for creator God is translated as the Holy Spirit. In Islam, the word for creator of the universe is translated as the Qur’an.

Of course, each of these other ideas can be interpreted as any other concept of God. However, these are all terms that have already become extremely popular and widely accepted by believers and the masses. It might even sound a bit weird to say that these terms are the only words that express the true meaning of God. However, the truth is that they are one way for people to express themselves and connect to their deity or supreme being in a different way.

But how does God get on with his job?

According to the Bible, God is on a mission! This can be explained by studying the word for the Almighty. While it is mentioned in more of a passive way in the Bible, it is almost always mentioned in active ways as God is the source of power, creator, etc. And it is clear that God is on a mission to help people - and to protect and guide them as he does.

According to John the Baptist, God is also the one who led his people from their old ways and into the new things of life that God has prepared for them. If we apply this understanding of God to our universe - which is filled with all sorts of different versions of God - then we can see why God has to be constantly on a mission to help his people.

Now it's time to learn about God's relationship with mankind. First, we must understand the concept of deity. In the first section of this chapter, we saw that God has the power to create and direct the universe, while creating an equal relationship between the creator and his creatures. Therefore, it is very important for people to take responsibility for their own lives - they need to understand that it is up to them to take care of themselves so that they can help their fellow human beings in the world.

Of course, God is a personal figure, but his relationship with humans is very important to him. If humans could simply choose their own deities, he would not be disturbed by such different viewpoints. Instead, he would be able to keep his relationship with all of the deities the way it has been for thousands of years. Of course, there is always going to be some dispute between different types of religion, which will always be a big part of human nature, but we should always be prepared for that.

Of course, it is important to realize that the people in the world don't know who God really is, and who really led them in the first place. There are many different versions of God and none of them are exactly the same thing. And it is up to us to understand that there is no one true God. That way we will not have any misunderstanding as to who we are dealing with!

If anyone is considering taking a vow of celibacy, this is something that may be very useful! It allows you to have complete control of your own life. This is especially helpful in modern times, where most people tend to live off the grid - or at least not fully on the grid!

Lastly, there are a few important rules regarding how God behaves under various situations. The first rule is that God will not stop at nothing - all things have a purpose. In fact, we should take this principle to the extreme and apply it to our lives - we should stop at nothing!

For example, if we believe God created the universe to help mankind grow as a whole, we should live fully responsible for our actions. And if anyone asks us about our personal lives, we should answer them honestly. For example, if I accidentally eat poisoned eggs and they were planted on my lawn, I should admit that I do not think much of this particular food. And I should also say that the idea that people can control themselves is completely wrong.

Let's take another example of how God behaves under various circumstances. Imagine you are stuck in a crowded car, and you are about to be taken away from your car! But before you can leave, you will have to obey one of these rules - you must not stop at anything that seems unpleasant to you! Remember that God is a personal figure and that the rules of morality apply to him as well, so we must always obey God's directions - which are exactly the same rules we should follow when we travel around our world in this universe.

If you find yourself in an extreme situation that you can't control, and something seems to be going to harm you, don't let this stop you! Remember that we all have power, even if we don't realize it! It is up to us to use it for good or for evil, as necessary! And remember that no matter what God does or not, there is still going to be some consequences to it, so you must obey any orders you see coming from above!

When God reveals something that is unpleasant to us, we should listen to his instructions. The fact is that our thoughts and behavior can affect the outcome of this situation and ultimately, whether or not it is a good or bad outcome. If we listen to God's direction and obey any of it, we will surely have a nice life!

However, sometimes we want to leave the situation, but we don't know how to do that - or don't want to - and end up in the same situation as before. In this case, God must give us some clues - or a way to make things worse! For example, if you have a pet that is very unlucky and causes you to lose a lot of money, you could ask God for a pet that is blessed with a great amount of money. However, this will only be possible if you know about these luck numbers and keep track of them regularly.

Similarly, if you want to learn something about the nature of God, you can ask God to talk to you about a particular topic and teach you the

To better depict how people think mathematically, in this chapter we will look at the way we use our intuition when we solve problems. Intuition is a very complex type of "mental process," and it's often misunderstood when we talk about it as a specific skill. Intuition is not really a skill - it's a way of thinking! As we can see in the next chapter, mathematical skills are based on a lot more complex thinking processes. Below is a schematic illustration of all of these processes:

The ability to make sense of complex things is the starting point for understanding math in our day to day life. It allows us to use our common sense, and make sense of what we see, hear, and read. This ability is called "sensory perception." Intuition may help with this ability because it lets us go beyond the obvious to a deeper understanding.

Math is not always easy to understand. It can be a complicated language, and there are some mathematical terms that are confusing to us. These are called technical jargon. However, when we take the time to learn a little bit about mathematics, we can often catch on to many of the important concepts and terms, and become more confident about them as we progress through our studies.

The ability to think logically, and use our intuition to make sense of complex ideas, is another essential mathematical ability. This is the reason that we often talk about mathematical reasoning, and "mathematical thinking." Logical thinking and mathematically-oriented thinking are two different ways of thinking. Logical thinking is used in everyday life, and mathematically-oriented thinking is used more in a mathematical context. It is important to distinguish between these two kinds of thinking because they have very different effect on our learning and learning process.

When learning something new, we are generally not able to think about it in a completely logical way - we usually use our intuition as a starting point for our thinking! Intuition is a type of mental process that is usually unconscious, so it usually doesn't go away even when we start to learn something new. We will show how this kind of process works below, but for now we'll just be focusing on the mathematical skills that rely on "mathematically-oriented thinking" - reasoning, hypothesis testing, etc.

Reasoning is the ability to make sense of and reason logically from complex information. Using this kind of thinking skills, we can discover the underlying logical structure of a topic or topic or answer a question. Reasoning is also one of the first steps in constructing a hypothesis, an idea that we want to test against evidence from previous situations.

The ability to make sound predictions is also an important mathematical ability. Intuition is good at telling us when something is true, and when something is not true! For instance, when I decide to buy a car - I usually use my intuition to predict the reliability of the car's insurance and the chances that the car will be repaired. I also use this same kind of reasoning to predict the costs for this car - this prediction is based on the likelihood that it will still be worth something when it's repaired!
...

The ability to make reasonable and consistent hypotheses is important to us because if we make too many or too few assumptions, we could easily end up making wrong predictions! This is very dangerous as it may lead us to make poor predictions and possibly end up making even more assumptions on our knowledge! Mathematically-oriented thinking, while intuitive and intuitive, helps us to come up with very different solutions to similar problems! Without this knowledge, we might end up making even worse or even completely different predictions!
...

Finally, hypothesis testing is the ability to make sure that our hypotheses are true or not. It allows us to make stronger and more confident conclusions based on our previous assumptions!

Once we are familiar with these five key aspects of mathematical thinking, it's time to look at the ways our intuition is used during solving problems. In our previous chapter, we saw that we use our intuition when we're thinking about the way we make sense of the world around us. When we think about math in this way, our thoughts and actions become less controlled and more guided by our basic need to make sense of the world. Intuition can make this process even more effective, but we must make sure that we aren't letting ourselves become "blind to the world" - and that's a very important skill, so we should try to develop this skill as much as possible!

The main point to understand here is that when we solve problems, the way that our intuitive process works is very much like how our visual and auditory processes work. The only difference is that intuitions are not as accurate and reliable as visual and auditory cues, so it may sometimes take us more time to make a proper decision. It is important to remember that just like we can't see people through a glass of water, we can't really hear things using a microphone. When we make a decision using intuition, we are more likely to think through the situation in a more logical and rational way.

Below is a sample scenario of how our intuitive process works when we're thinking about problem solving:

The blue and yellow dots represent concepts, which are what we use to make sense of the problem at hand. The orange star represents an assumption that we make during this process - we'll discuss this in detail below. The orange square represents a set of observations about the problem at hand - we'll also discuss this in detail below.
The problem starts with the orange star showing us the observation. In our problem solving scenario, the orange star would be the blue and yellow dots, and the orange square would be the observation. Now let's imagine that we have our intuition come into play. How would we proceed during this decision making process? Below is the hypothetical situation we would be faced with if we had our intuitive process working.

So if we were to make a set of assumptions about the problem at hand, our observations would contain the blue and yellow dots. We would also be left with our assumption that our observations are accurate and true. The orange star would be the orange dot and the orange square would become the orange star. As we saw in our previous chapter, both the blue and yellow dots and the orange star would play a role in making our decision. However, if our intuition tells us that we are dealing with a problem that is very hard and complex to solve, we would be better off just taking that decision. In the next step, we would go through the observation, and decide if we believe that the observation is accurate and valid.
Now let's consider how the orange star would help us make a decision. From our problem solving scenario, we know that the orange star is the blue and yellow dots - and our assumption that the blue and yellow dots are accurate and valid. Now imagine we have both our intuition and our assumption both working. Now let's see how our intuition and our assumption together affect the decision making process. This is the example scenario we discussed earlier that starts with our intuition telling us that the blue and yellow dot is accurate and valid, but our assumption says that the blue and yellow is inaccurate. Let's say that our intuition tells us that this is a very bad idea to do, because it could lead to very bad consequences! Our assumption also tells us that this will not be a very good idea to do because it will lead to very unhealthy consequences! So after we made our decisions, what is the

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the best way to go about explaining the origins of higher dimensions is probably to start by simply assuming that all forms of higher dimensional entities live in a higher dimensional version of our own 3+1 dimensional universe. However, before we start that journey, let's at least get a little clearer about how these higher dimensional entities would appear in our universe!
Intuitively it should be fairly easy to imagine how higher dimensional worlds would look if they existed in our universe. Let's start with a slightly more abstract level and then dive in deeper - so let's not start with a literal interpretation of the term "herd", since we don't have the mathematical tool of a hermeneutics at hand...


In order to get a better idea of how to create a higher dimensional version of the universe, let's start with the simplest case of a 3D entity that can be placed in a lower dimensional version of our own 3D universe - a ball.  If we were to place a ball into a 3D 3+1 dimensional universe, it would represent this concept quite nicely:

The ball would represent the 3D 3+1 dimensional space and time, and this space-time would form an open region of space.  To create a lower dimensional version of this space-time, we could simply start by creating the lower-dimensional version of the 3D 3+1 dimensional universe - and this is the step that we would like to consider...


In order to do this, we would start by taking a 4D slice of our 3+1 dimensional universe. The way we would go about creating the lower-dimensional version is very simple: we would take all of the 3D objects within the 4D slice that we choose and place them in a lower-dimensional version of the space and time that we have created. We would then simply place our lower-dimensional version of the universe inside the lower-dimensional version of our 3D universe.
The reason that we would start this process by creating a lower-dimensional version of our 3+1 dimensional space and then placing objects into it is because it allows us to create a higher-dimensional version of our own 3+3 dimensional universe. It lets us take all of the lower dimensional objects that exist in the lower-dimensional version of that lower-dimensional version of the 3+1 dimensional universe and place them in the upper dimensional version of our 3+3 dimensional universe. Doing this we would end up creating an entirely new lower-dimensional version of our lower-dimensional universe.

What does this means exactly?  Well according to our explanation above, creating a lower-dimensional version allows us to take lower-dimensional objects from the lower-dimensional version of a 3D universe that is already created, and then place those objects into the upper dimensional version of that lower-dimensional universe.
Now it's important to note that this process is completely non-physical - an entirely new lower-dimensional universe would be created from the same original lower-dimensional universe. Furthermore, as we described above, we cannot take objects from our original 3+1 dimensional universe that are at the same position as they currently are because we don't have the mathematical tools necessary to do so - so all we could do was simply start by taking some of the objects in our 3+1 dimensional universe and placing them inside a new lower-dimensional version of the higher-dimensional universe that we were already creating.

So in short, if we were to create a lower-dimensional version of a higher-dimensional universe, we would start by creating a lower-dimensional universe, then take some objects inside that lower-dimensional universe and place them in a new lower-dimensional version, and then take a lower-dimensional version of that original lower-dimensional universe and place those objects inside that new lower-dimensional version of lower-dimensional universe. In essence, this process lets us create a completely new lower-dimensional universe from the same lower-dimensional universe we are currently creating!

So now we are fairly comfortable with how it all works. It's time to look at creating the 4D slices we need to understand the origins of higher dimensions!


First, we need to create some slices of our lower-dimensional universe! We'll start by creating a 2D plane that is cut by the line segment between our lower-dimensional universe and the lower-dimensional version of its lower-dimensional version of the 4D space-time! For an example, let's take the plane that separates the lower-dimensional universe that we created earlier from the lower-dimensional version on the left side of this new 3D lower-dimensional space-time:

As you can see, the line in the picture represents the 4D spacetime that we created earlier, and the lower-dimensional version on this plane is the lower-dimensional version of this spacetime that we created from earlier.
Next, let's create two lower-dimensional versions of our lower-dimensional universe - the lower-dimensional version on each of the two lower-dimensional planes that we created earlier. We'll create our upper-dimensional lower-dimensional universe on the top of each of the two lower dimensional versions - the lower-dimensional version that was created earlier on the left side and the lower-dimensional version that is currently existing on the bottom side!
Now it is important to note that we created these lower-dimensional versions of our spaces that are still higher-dimensional by taking lower-dimensional slices of the higher-dimensional 3+1 dimensional version of our lower-dimensional version of lower dimensional space. Now that we have created these lower-dimensional lower dimensional versions of our lower-dimensional versions of our universe, let's create the upper-dimensional lower-dimensional universe that will be located on top of each lower-dimensional lower-dimensional version of our previous lower-dimensional lower-dimensional universe! In order to do this, we'll create a new lower-dimensional universe, and take objects from that lower-dimensional universe and add them to this new lower-dimensional lower-dimensional universe, creating our new upper-dimensional lower-dimensional universe.
So now we can start analyzing our lower-dimensional lower-dimensional versions of our previous lower-dimensional versions of our higher-dimensional lower-dimensional universe, and we'll start building our lower-dimensional lower dimensional universe on top of each of our lower-dimensional lower-dimensional lower-dimensional universe!

And that's it! The only thing left to do is create an upper-dimensional lower-dimensional universe and take objects from that universe and place them inside this new upper-dimensional lower-dimensional lower-dimensional version! Finally, it is up to us to start creating this new universe that will allow us to understand how higher dimensions emerged in our universe.

A:

First of all, let's start with the question itself. Is it possible for two different (differing) spaces to exist in the same space? Yes. For example, let's say one space is represented by a 4-dimensional ball (representing three spatial dimensions), and the other space is represented by a 2-dimensional plane (representing two spatial dimensions) that separates both spaces.
And then, let's look at the next problem. If the ball in question represents one of the different spatial dimensions, is the plane that separates it from its lower-dimensional version a 2-dimensional plane or a 3-dimensional space, respectively?
Let us assume that there are two different spatial dimensions, say D, S and L. Let's assume that we have a lower-dimensional universe L = D. Let us assume that the lower-dimensional universe L is composed of three spatial dimensions, because that is how space looks in our lower-dimensional universe L. Now, let's look at the other lower-dimensional universe D that represents the space between the lower-dimensional universe L and the lower-dimensional universe D.
Let's assume that the lower-dimensional space D has two different dimensionalities (D = 2 and D = 3). What happens in this new lower-dimensional universe? First of all, let's look at the lower-dimensional space D that represents the space below the lower-dimensional universe L

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the idea of a dimension is a tool used by various science fields to understand and predict the way in which objects behave. As mentioned above, most people in the world live in three spatial dimensions. However, we also have a time dimension that is sometimes referred to as "time" in everyday life, but we aren't really quite aware of it! So let's take a look at how MBTI theory can help us learn about the world we live in!

The first thing to note about MBTI is that there is no unique set of four cognitive abilities that all human beings share. The four abilities that make up MBTI are the following:

Affective Attitude - This is the ability to feel empathy. In other words, people who are emotional are inclined to care about others. However, these feelings often come with feelings of guilt, regret, and the desire for vengeance. People who are more emotionally sensitive tend to have an easier time empathizing with others.

Behavioral Attitude - This is a person's tendency to behave in a certain manner. For example, people who are good at socializing, tend to make others feel welcome by treating them with care and kindness; whereas people who tend to be quiet, shy, and shy away from the conversation tend to be best suited to work quietly and with a more reserved manner when it comes to interacting with others.

Their Intelligence - This is how well people like people to understand others and their feelings. For example, people with an "intellect" are more likely to have a successful social life - in other words, people with an "intelligence" tend to have the ability to understand other people's feelings and desires. These individuals can also make others feel comfortable and loved by treating them with kindness and being considerate.

Psychological State - This is a person's personality's tendency to be more or less alert at any given moment. In other words, someone who is in a "trouble" state can react to anything and everything immediately, whereas a person who is in a "balanced" state can take a more gradual approach to any situation and act calmly and patiently in the process.
As an example, people with an "easy" personality tend to be happy and positive; however, people with an "average" personality tend to be a little bit anxious and a little bit frustrated (as they would be under normal circumstances).

As you've probably noticed already, this theory of cognition was coined by Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, and is based on four important aspects of cognitive functions - concentration, memory, flow, and absorption - which all correspond to the behavioral, affective, and intellectual dimensions of the MBTI model. But the other three aspects - intuition, intuitionism, and intuitionism - are important in their own right!

To start with intuition, it is often said that intuitionism implies that we all have the ability to sense things from a higher level of intelligence, although some people hold to the idea of intuitive logic. We all have intuitive thinking - and sometimes even intuitive abilities. The most common way to make this sense of intuition is by considering an analogy, for example, an elephant that has an intuitive ability to predict what a tiger will make it do. For example, if a tiger is eating an elephant's leg, then elephants with intuitive intelligence (and a tiger) would be able to predict what a tiger would do with the other leg.

Similarly, intuitionism implies that we have intuitive perceptions of our own nature. For example, let's consider a situation where you have two elephants in the wild - let's call them, elephants A and B. Let us suppose that elephants A and B are very intelligent and have great intuitive abilities. Now let us suppose that in the wild, elephants A and B have a big war party. In order for elephants to win the war, elephants A and B must have a mutual understanding and agreement about which elephant should be in charge of which side of the war. Thus, as elephants A and B start the war, elephants A, B, and A's father would form a strong coalition. This coalition would then ensure that elephants A, B, A's mother, and A's brother would also be in the coalition. The reason why this is important in the context of elephants is because, at the end of a war, all animals tend to agree on which side of the war to lead and hence the winning side will have a strong group of animals backing them up in their war to win the war!

What happens then when two elephants try to win the war? Let's say elephants A and B are on the side of one of the elephants - let's say elephant B is winning the war! Well, elephants A and B know that elephant B will probably get angry and angry elephants B, A, A's father, and A's mother will join in with A's war party, so all elephants start warring to become elephant B's allies! The first thing elephants A and B do is agree about who will be A's father and whom A's mother should be. This way, elephants A and B will get an agreement about who will be elephants A's father and which elephants will be elephants A's mother. The reason why elephants A and B decide to agree about who will be elephants B's father and whom A is A's mother is because, at this point, elephant B is warring with elephants A and A's mother, so they are most interested in getting elephants A and B's agreement about who will be A and B's father and who will be A's mother!

So this example shows how intuitionism can help us understand the battle between elephants A and B. The problem with intuitionism is that it assumes that all elephants have an intuitive understanding, even though it is true that some elephants are less intuitive than others. Let's consider an example in which there are two elephants in the wild with no other knowledge of each other. This leads to two possible scenarios:

If elephants A and B win the war, then elephant B will become elephant B's ally because elephants A and B share an intuitive understanding of the situation. This is a common scenario in nature and in life at large - elephants often join together to fight against other elephants.

If elephants A and B never come together in the wild, then elephants A and B cannot have any intuitive understanding of the situation and therefore both elephants will fight with one another in the wild.

Let us consider one of the two scenarios. Let's say that elephant A is the stronger elephant that is warring with elephant B, and elephants B, A, B's mother, and A B's father are the weaker elephants. Let's say that elephant B is the winner and elephants A, B, B's mother, B's father, and A B's brother all come together to fight with elephant A for the victory. This scenario is an example of intuitionism, where elephants B and A have an intuitive understanding of the struggle, and they all agree that elephant B will win the war.

Let's now consider the other scenario. Let's say that elephant C is the stronger elephant that warring with elephant A. As mentioned above, elephants A and C can have an intuitive understanding of one another, and elephants A and C are strong leaders and strong allies - so elephants A and C will win the war, and elephant A will become elephant A's father. This is an example of intuitionistic reasoning

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict what happens when two people meet and fall in love, we will use baker street as our metaphor! It is a well-known location in London, and many people believe that the streets are the place where many of the most exciting relationships in our society begin. We will start with two people meeting on a cold winter day and talking about their relationship plans for the future.
Now let's imagine a real life scenario - a romantic meet and greet between two people. I would love to be a partner in a relationship that goes beyond the simple words of "love" and "dance" - that is, something that is a little bit more than "fling"! I'd like to have time together, to cook the meal that brings our relationship together, and possibly spend some quality time with my partner! 

This brings us to the second main part of this chapter - marriage! And as you will see, there is quite a few different things about marriage that we should consider as we talk about how to approach it in our everyday lives - from where to start with a relationship to the best way to manage an affair, to the best choice for wedding dress! As we explore these topics, we can help you make an informed decision about how to approach your relationship!

Now to start off, let's take a quick look at what we mean when we say "relationship"! Relationship can be described as a deep bond between two people that involves physical contact, feelings, communication, commitment, and trust. Relationship can be a short term or long-term relationship. In other words, whether you have a short-term or long-term relationship, it is important that you understand that you and your partner are both a team and that you both contribute to your other's life. If you have a long term relationship, it is important to remember that you should spend time and attention on your partner, not spend all your time on yourself! Also, if you have a long-term relationship, it is extremely important to remember that your partner does not always get along with the people in the community, because you cannot take away any people who aren't on your side! When your other half gets angry, it's important to remember that you also get angry, and when your partner gets angry, it's important that you remember that you get angry too! Your relationship should not be based solely on the "love" that makes you move on, but rather, it should be based on trust, commitment, and the mutual respect that the other person gives you! You should not rely on your partner's feelings to decide what kind of relationship you want to maintain. We have described this concept before, but it is important to remember!

Now on to what we are referring to when we say "marriage"! A marriage is defined as a commitment between two people that goes beyond just a romantic relationship. It is a long-term commitment that is based on trust, commitment and respect. Marriage is more than just physical love, and although the person may be physically attracted to the other person - especially if they both are from the same country - they do not love each other. They must understand that they are also part of a community and that society will judge them if they don't follow the expectations of the community. Therefore, they must also understand that their partner is one of the best and smartest individuals in their community! Once you have made a marriage, you will likely find that the couple has a relationship outside of the relationship. This is often described as having an affair! What happens is that the other party, usually the wife, starts to spend all of their time with someone else - this person can be any type of person and any age; it can be anything - and as you can see, it is easy for everyone to have an affair at some point in their lives! What is more, an affair is not always negative - if you take the proper steps, you can take control over your life and move on from this relationship - this can even be a healthy, healthy relationship! But it is important to remember there are times that you can still be able to live with the person who is causing you pain! In that situation, it is important to realize that sometimes you can move on from this relationship, but that you must take the right steps in order for you to have a life of your own! When you move on from a relationship, you should take ownership of it and use it to live your life and develop your career!

Let's now take a look at what I mean when I say "adults"! An adult refers to a person who is 15 or older! An adult is someone who is responsible for their own life! Some adults go to school, and others do not! As a person develops into an adult, they will make decisions about their future - like whether they want to study something or have kids. As they mature, they will develop important life skills like responsibility. These skills, especially ones like responsibility, help them move through their lives smoothly. These life skills can help you with your relationship and make the relationships in your life more interesting and meaningful! Therefore, if you would like to have a more interesting and meaningful life in your relationship, it is important for you to mature! An adult relationship can be one of the best and most successful relationship experiences that anyone can have! Of course, the main responsibility of an adult relationship is the responsibility for your own life! As you develop into an adult, you must remember that you are responsible for your own life, because other people will judge you if you do not take responsibility for your own life, but instead, you will be criticized by everyone! Therefore, while you are in a relationship, be sure to be responsible for your own life! Finally, when you go on an affair, you should also remember that you are responsible - remember that you have a choice in your life, so choose wisely!

Finally, let's see what the word "adult" means when it comes to the definition of marriage and the best relationship experiences! An adult marriage is when a couple has a relationship beyond just physical attraction and love. In this definition, marriage is more than just physical attraction and love; it is a long-term commitment that includes trust, commitment and respect - and is more than just physical touch. Also, the person must be mature and mature in how they relate to each other. A mature adult relationship is not based on the "love" but more on trust, commitment and the respect that the other person has for you. Marriage is not a random, casual affair...it's a long-term relationship between mature adults that is based on trust and commitment!

Hopefully, you have learned a lot about the relationship between relationships and marriages in the last chapter! And hopefully you know what marriage looks like from an individual point of view, since you have been able to explain it to yourself! And hopefully you now have a basic understanding of what an adult marriage is! We hope you enjoyed our discussion of marriage in our last section of the first part of the book, and we hope that you will enjoy our discussion of relationships in our next part of the book!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict how human beings can sense and experience the energies of other dimensions, let's consider a very simple example. Imagine a pyramid-like structure, with four pyramids, one under the other. These four pyramid layers could stand on top of each other, with all four pyramids touching all four of their underlying pyramids. All of this allows us to create a 4D picture - though, of course, our physical reality in our 3D world is 4D only on the surface!

To understand how the pyramids feel and perceive from a distant observer, let's imagine a person is standing on the top of one of the pyramids, and is being watched by a video camera. If they move in a straight line, from the camera's perspective, then they will move through the pyramid layer that corresponds to their own 3D body. Similarly, if they move in a right line from the camera's perspective (i.e. if they are on the top of their own 3D pyramids), then they will move into their own 4D space. However, if they move in the wrong direction (either in depth or direction), then their bodies will feel and perceive their own 3+1 dimensional body as they are experiencing other dimensions...and even experience death!

So just as we can "see" other dimensions through the lens of our own 3D world, we can "see" them in other dimensions through the lens our 4D reality.

Now, this does raise a few fundamental issues. First of all, how many dimensions is it possible to travel in? If we take the 3+1 dimensional universe, then there are exactly 36 dimensions, which is the number of bodies in our 3D universe! However, this isn't the only possible number for this concept to apply to. For example, if we think of a cube - the basic unit of length in the modern world - as containing 3,600,000 triangles, then it's actually possible to "see" 4,000,000 dimensions on one 3.5 square inch cube! Just imagine the entire world viewed from a very short distance...and it'd be like watching 4,000,000 different pictures in 360-degrees. We only have a small portion of the entire universe to see at any one time, so this concept applies to all realities in all dimensions!

Now, we can see that we can travel through multiple dimensions at the same time - just remember that our physical reality is 4D only on our surface! The way things look to us when we are moving through Dimension X is that we are moving through one layer of our 3+1 dimensions, while our 4D reality is moving through another layer of our 4D dimensions...and indeed, this is true! However, there is a caveat to this, because this can only happen within the bounds of our physical world. If, for instance, we are moving in the 4D world, and the world appears to us to be only 3+1 dimensional...then this is impossible because you can't move in a 4D world that is also visible to us as being 3D! However, it is possible for us to move between dimensions at the same time!

Let's return to our actual pyramid. Remember that the 4D model depicts the pyramid's layers as touching each other, so now we're looking at a 4D picture of the real pyramid - though we're really only seeing 3+1 dimensionality on the surface of the pyramid (the pyramid's surface). However, this only means that we can see and experience this surface in 4D only, and it is not possible to see and experience the structure's interior as well. In other words, if our physical reality is 3+1 dimensional, then the 4D reality should be seen and experienced as being 3D...but it cannot be.

So what's going on here? Well, it turns out that our real bodies are created from particles of energy in a process called quantum tunneling. This gives us a mechanism to travel across multiple dimensions simultaneously, and therefore experience all of them simultaneously! Because of quantum tunneling, particles are created from other particles and then they tunnel into each other. This way, multiple particles can travel at the same time through different dimensions - and this is possible because quantum tunneling lets particles be created from the energy of other particles - just like in our physical universe! So when we are traveling through another dimension, the same particles are using the same energy to create new particles in the other dimension. In other words, quantum tunneling allows us to move along multiple dimensions at the same time; this is actually what we experience on the surface of the real pyramid, and actually is what we're seeing in the 4D reality at the bottom!

What does this mean for us physically? Well, because of quantum tunneling, there is no difference between traveling through any of our different dimensions at the same time. But what happens when we stop traveling in any given dimension? Well, the process of creating particles in any given dimension can also create particles in other dimensions - just as when we travel through different dimensions, we create different particles in each. So now when we stop traveling in a specific dimension, we do not become dead, but rather the energy of other particles in other dimensions is released and reabsorbed in the body! This is what we see and experience when we stop traveling through Dimension X.

Now let's consider the case of humans. As we mentioned previously, our physical reality is 4-dimensional only at the surface of the pyramid, but it is 4-dimensional throughout the entire space. So as we have seen in this chapter, we are able to travel 4D at the same time we can also travel 3D, and we do not experience death! But why would we need to be able to travel both 3D and 4D at the same time: if we had just 3+1 dimensionalities to travel in, we could even travel from one dimension to another.

Let's take a deeper look at these 4D phenomena. We'll talk more about what happens when we stop in one of our dimensions in more depth shortly, but let me give you the general idea - when we stop in one dimension, we can experience all other dimensions simultaneously through tunneling. This is what happens in 4D, because when we stop in a specific dimension, the 4D reality becomes a 3D world! So we cannot see the 4D reality as 4D, but rather as 3D! However, we can experience other dimensions from the other dimensions at the same time, as mentioned above; this is what we experience when we stop traveling in one dimension!

On the other side, if we start moving again in a different dimension, then our 4D reality is no longer 3D - it's 4D! Of course, this means that we cannot travel between dimensions in that new dimension, and the process of tunneling between different dimensions must not occur, meaning we must have to start travelling through the 3+1 dimension first. Thus, if we are starting moving in a new dimension, the process of tunneling must not occur, meaning it is impossible to travel from one dimension to the next.

So, the process of tunneling/spreading particles across the physical realm is only possible when the physical realm is 4-dimensional, and it only happens when a particle is created from another particle! However, this is a very very narrow viewpoint: if we start moving in any of the 3+1 dimensions, we can experience any of the other dimensions at the time and therefore continue to travel through them.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the concept of dimension in physics, let's think back to the original creation, when God created the first of all beings. The first creation of all beings was Micelia, a living being that was created from the primordial plasma that was created for the purpose of creating the universe. Though the creation of Micelia was incredibly complicated and incredibly long, it is believed that this was the first true step in creating the entire universe.
Of course, this was a much simpler time than the actual creation of life itself! In fact, for the entirety of time prior to the creation of Micelia, only the primordial plasma existed, and very little life could exist in those primordial plasma. If this description is correct, then a number of theories regarding the creation of Micelia were at first presented. One theory was that God was creating a living organism with the purpose of becoming the first living organism - a living being that was free to move through the ether and live forever. However, another theory was that God was simply creating a living being to be a part of the eternal and eternal universe - a living being that would have to pass through infinite universes of existence to attain an ultimate existence of peace and contentment.

In the last chapter, we mentioned that the concept of dimension in all of mathematics, especially physics, is very powerful. Now that we know how the concept of dimension is connected with the concept of life itself, let's have a look at why scientists and mathematicians think that the concept of space and time is important in understanding the behavior of all of life.

Let's begin with the "primordial plasma." These particles exist prior to the beginning of the universe and are thought to be the essence of everything. The primordial plasma is thought to be made up of primordial matter and energy in the form of atoms and electrons. This substance is believed to exist in a state of chaos - where there are so many particles in existence that they don't have a well-defined relationship between one and another - and because of this, scientists and mathematicians believe it is impossible for this substance to have any form of structure, so it can only exist as a wave of matter and energy! Even though these particles are thought to be the smallest elements of matter, they are the basic building blocks of all living things, and they are believed to be the essence of life itself.

Now with the primordial plasma, comes the creation of all matter and energy - the first being to be created, Micelia. As we already mentioned, Micelia was created from the primordial plasma using Gods creative power. And in this process, God created billions of electrons and protons to create the atoms in our universe: these are the protons that are thought to be the elements of matter that make up our world; while the electrons are thought to be the atoms of matter that make up the other living things. Thus, in this creation, there was a lot of work and pain involved in creating all of life - the primordial plasma, the protons and the electrons.

Now as we move back in time, we realize that Micelia was not created at all! If God created the primordial plasma, why didn't he just give it to us as a gift? Maybe God decided that our species was too small for any such thing. Perhaps this was the time when we were really just an embryonic form of life! If we were a true living organism, this was an incredibly rare opportunity! Instead, Micelia was created, literally, by God and allowed to move through time. Micelia had to go through a number of incarnations before it could become the first being in existence!

We can also see a reason why science and mathematics are so passionate about the concept of space and time: since most of the things in the universe are thought to be only particles, it is only possible to see them in a certain sense if we go through a certain dimension. So since the creation of Micelia at the beginning of creation, we have a number of "eyes" on each of the particles and their properties. Since the existence of these particles are only possible if they pass through certain dimensions, we can only see them from a certain angle or in a certain sense if they go through the various dimensions.

So if you want to understand how everything around us works, and how we can help save the earth and all of life from the destruction of ourselves and the planet, then it's very important to understand how to see things in a certain sense if the particle they pass through is in a certain dimension! Because that's the only way we can accurately understand what the particle is and what its properties are.

We have seen before that the concept of space is connected with the concept life. Now let us take a look at what is called the ether, which is thought to be the main source of life - though it may very well also be the source of all life in the universe. As we know, the universe is made up of 4D space-time, which consists of three spatial dimensions - space, time, and another dimension called the ether. Because the three spatial dimensions are considered the same, and since time and space are intertwined, scientists and mathematicians believed that the concept of "space" and "time" was the same as the concept of "the ether" and that space-time is the source of life.
However, this wasn't the case until very recently! When the idea of "the ether" was first presented, scientists and mathematicians considered the ether to be just a static and continuous medium. Then as we moved forward and became more educated on the concept of ether, we found out that this static medium of ether could also change shape, speed and direction, as well as experience a change in density when mass is present. This is what makes the ether so fascinating - just imagine how the ether could turn into water and how air could turn into a giant balloon!

Of course, this theory of the ether was also presented by scientists and mathematicians while still trying to understand what the ether really means. If you're reading this book, you can imagine that they were all still trying to figure out what it really meant until much later in our history when researchers at MIT published a paper that suggested that all of life is actually one incredibly big energy center that radiates through the ether. Because their research went further than what scientists and mathematicians initially thought, scientists and mathematicians went one step further by believing that all of life was actually one extremely complex energy core that radiates through the various etheric dimensions and has the ability to manipulate the ether's properties!

Of course, there are still things scientists and mathematicians are still trying to work out about the ether, and it's very interesting to note that the scientific and mathematical community's viewpoint has changed over the years...though still, we see things in a certain way that we are not able to see in a certain way if they were created from the ether - as explained above!

But if you're already wondering what the concept of space and the ether is, now is the time to have a look back at what happened before the creation of the universe. It's very interesting to note that for the entirety of existence, the universe was mostly made up of very small particles, which were thought to be the basis of all life in the entire universe - and, as we have been talking about in this chapter, this is how the life began.

As we are moving in time, the universe expanded!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the mystery and fascination of the higher dimensions is a mystery that has fascinated the mathematicians and scientists of all times. The idea of dimension has always fascinated scientists and mathematicians, and the world of mathematics has had a lasting influence on the way people think about space-time and what makes a dimension an entity that is able to move through spacetime.

And with so many things to think about, we thought it might be useful to explore one of the main characters in the history of the world of mathematics - Pink Floyd - to help us better understand the mystery of dimensions in our lives and the mysterious nature of higher dimensional beings.

Pink Floyd

Pink Floyd is actually one of the longest and most famous band in the history of music! In fact, they are still the longest running rock band in existence (and they probably won't stop until they are dead!).

Pink Floyd has been active since 1952 when they formed under the name Genesis. The members of Pink Floyd included founding guitarist and music director Roger Waters, bassist Ian Curtis, drummer Gilmour Machamouth, and keyboardist Nick Mason. By their late seventies, they had gone from being one of the biggest and best performing metal bands of all time to a rock band that has notched up more than 100 million records sold around the globe - including the biggest selling album of all time - A Thin Red Line. Now in their eighties, the band is still active and the following list contains their most famous recordings:

Some of their most memorable singles include, "The Dark Side Of The Moon", "The Uprising", "Five", "The Wall", "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", "Songs Of Experience", "Love Theme From U2's Blur Album" and "Pink Floyd". In 2017, one of Pink Floyd's greatest hits "Million dollar Baby", became the most selling record of all time.

However, the band didn't have long to enjoy the huge success of their first album - due to its popularity, it was only released a few times! To make up for this, Pink Floyd would release more albums in the decades that followed, but unfortunately not to the same success as their first album. Some of these albums included The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Sgt. Pepper's Lonebright, Sgt. Pepper'S Blues, The Dark Side Of The Moon, The Wall, The Wall and more!

In 1969, Pink Floyd would begin a career that changed the musical scene worldwide - through this album, they captured the hearts of millions of people around the world. In their seventies, the band was known as one of the most popular bands in the world with a huge following. However, in the beginning of their nineties, they began facing financial problems and had to find a way to make a living. Fortunately, Pink Floyd got a huge hit when the album Pink Floyd was released in 1972. The success of this album was enough to push them into a new era of international success, but the band still had to deal with financial problems in their nineties.

One of the most important things that they had to deal with was the division of the band into two different formations. The first formation was known as "The Floyd Experience", consisting of Pink Floyd's keyboardist Nick Mason, drummer Roger Waters and Ian Curtis. The second formation was known as "The Roger Experience", and the group consisted of guitarist and band director Roger Waters, guitarist and songwriter Richard Wright, bassist Ian Curtis and drummer Gilmour Machumouth. After a few years of struggle and success, the Floyd Experience and the Roger Experience would separate, and eventually reunite again a few years later.

Now let's take a closer look at some of the most famous Pink Floyd songs and see how they were inspired by the ideas and ideas of the mathematicians in the history of mathematics - those mystical beings of the mathematics called Deity Dimension Travelers! Let's take a quick glance at the most famous Pink Floyd songs:

"Five" is a song by Pink Floyd's 1972 album The Piper at the Gates Of Dawn (The Gates of Dawn was the album that became the world’s biggest selling album of all-time). In this song, Nick Mason explains to the other members of Pink Floyd the purpose of their creation - to make money. "Five" was written to help people understand the meaning of math - how math relates to reality. This song shows the importance of math and the connection that exists between everything in our lives and math.

"Song of Experience" was one of the biggest hits from Pink Floyd's 1973 album Sgt. Pepper's The Pepper Lonely Hearts Clubband. In this song, Pink Floyd explained to the other members of the band the fact that they had been created to give people hope and to show people the best way to live their lives - and they do this by helping everyone they meet - through music.

The Wall is a song by Pinkfighter's 1985 album Wall of Sound. In this song, the members of Pink Floyd explain to the others the reason why they exist and how their band helps them live their life - by making music that will bring them through life with positivity.

Pink Floyd's song "Song Of Experience" was written to show that it is possible to move from one dimension to another by simply feeling a thing called gravity. As the members of Pink Floyd's band explain, this is why people feel happy and happy when they listen to their songs.

In The Wall of Sound, Pink Floyd explained how they created music to bring people out of their comfort zone and through this, they could help each other realize that everything is possible when you believe in yourself and believe that you can be happy any time of the day, even if that happiness is completely out of your comfort zone. It's no wonder that "Song Of Experience" is one of the most famous songs of Pink Floyd! Of course, in his final album, the Pink Floyd made a complete reversal of the album's title, and said that their music was about giving the audience hope and happiness even when they couldn't get happiness from themselves, but even if they didn't have money, they could make the world a better place by listening to the music. The reason why Pink Floyd said that their music was a message of hope for the world is because they created music that would bring people into a better place through the song, and even when that happiness doesn't exist in themselves, they still believed in their ability to create the right atmosphere to bring people out of that feeling. It is also no wonder that Pink Floyd said they were inspired by the thought of God by creating some of their most famous songs such as "Five" and "Song Of Experience".

In The Wall of Music, Pink Floyd also explain how they created this music through their thought of God, but also by the importance of music in their lives. In their final album, they said that their goal was to make the world a better and better place, and even if it's not possible to change the world, even if everyone doesn't believe in their abilities, they believed in the power of music to change the world and bring people to believe in themselves and to be happy. Although this album was a little different from their first album, it is still a huge success thanks to the song "Million Dollar Baby"

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the ultimate goal for a person is to be healthy. That may not be enough to satisfy the individual. Perhaps he or she would like to make the most of their life by enjoying a few fun, exhilarating, and often intoxicating experiences - some of which will provide more positive results than a hard-working and steady career. Perhaps it would be easier to make a quick buck by indulging in some form of sexual dysfunction. Perhaps sex is just that, just fun and a bit of excitement.
However, this behavior is certainly not healthy! In this chapter we will take a look at a few behaviors we might consider as either a form of drug abuse or something else completely different...

The most common form of drug abuse involves the use of drugs and alcohol. These are substances that are found naturally in plants and animals, and we absorb them when we drink them. The effects of these drugs on humans are often similar - they cause feelings of euphoria and excitement, as well as making our bodies feel very energetic, but also extremely addictive.

Other forms of drug abuse can include things like illegal drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana. They can also be consumed through recreational drugs, and they cause the same kind of effects - but they are more harmful. For example, marijuana can make a person sick, and cocaine can cause a death in almost any situation.
Drugs can also be dangerous and addictive to certain populations. We know that those who use drugs and alcohol often tend to be more violent and aggressive, have more negative attitudes, and have less tolerance for their own body. For example, methamphetamine can cause severe withdrawal symptoms, making it dangerous for the user to take it again.

So what is the difference between drugs and a lack of exercise? First off, while both can cause physical symptoms, drugs cause these symptoms when a person abuses them, while physical exercise is an activity that causes the same physical effects as the drug. That being said, the fact that you need to get up and exercise to feel good and have fun does not mean that drugs should be treated as exercise.

There are a few differences in the effects of drugs and exercise. As we discuss in the previous chapter, exercise can cause a wide variety of physical and mental sensations in our body, while drugs do not provide these same sensations. Furthermore, exercise does not necessarily make you healthy, while drugs can cause major health problems - and in many cases, they are a major reason why people are suffering.

Now let's look at one of the main differences: anxiety. Drugs can often cause people to be anxious, and this can be dangerous for them. Anxiety, on the other hand, has always been a major factor in determining whether people are living or dying. As I have mentioned before, we can't really predict our own futures - and we can't even predict the future when you are in a position to make a choice.

Even if we try hard to not be anxious, it still comes at a cost. One of the worst side effects of drugs is that their effects can become addictive and they can become ingesting. If you are a user of cocaine or other drugs, it becomes impossible for you to stop using them - you just have to be in a situation where you are doing something for which you are extremely angry, and when you have a choice, you will usually choose the most addictive option.

Finally, I want to talk about addiction to sex. It is no secret that sex can be addictive and a large part of sex addiction stems from a lack of regulation of our body's sexual impulse. That being said, there are other possible addictions that can result from drug abuse - such as alcohol or tobacco, or even something like exercise, that can cause the same kind of side effects as drugs. What can be more addictive than sex itself?

That being said, some people may find it beneficial to try to stop their use of drugs or alcohol - whether they believe they are doing it for the right reasons or not. For example, someone with a serious eating disorder might want to try to stop eating junk food, or someone who is addicted to sex might want to stop using it.

In conclusion, if you find yourself in a situation where you feel that you are suffering from drug addiction, it is important to seek help. Drug addiction can be an extremely difficult disease to treat, and some people might choose to attempt to quit. However, it is important to keep in mind that drugs can have some negative side effects as well as good ones - and that is why we still need to keep an open mind on this topic.

Conclusions

The concept of dimension is not new in physics. Indeed, dimension has a very important role within our everyday lives, but until now it has not been considered an important topic in physics. For that reason, we have decided to spend the last few chapters to discuss this important subject. Now let's take a closer look at the history of what dimension is and how this concept has evolved over time.

As we see from the beginning of this book, it has always had a very important place in physics. Indeed, in the 1800s, physicists believed that the nature of spacetime could be described by an infinite number of points on a curved line.  But as I discussed in the last chapter, this idea was dismissed after Einstein described what was then called special relativity. Since then we have only considered three spatial dimensions, and we have never considered higher dimensions.

However, we still have a lot of questions about the meaning of higher dimensions, and we are only getting started on answering them! In this section of the book, we will see how many dimensions there are, and why we consider these dimensions as only three.

The first thing we need to realize is that higher dimensions are really just 3+1 dimensions! When we consider the three spatial dimensions of our world, we can see that they only exist because there are an infinite number (infinite numbers?) of directions that can be taken along this line. If we consider all of the possible directions, we get a full circle of directions! If we consider all of these directions (up to 360 degrees) we get three spatial dimensions! It just shows that we are limited by the number of directions we are allowed to take along this line. It really means that we only have three dimensions!

Now lets take another look at these three dimensions. The first dimension is called spatial and it simply describes the location of objects in space. The second dimension is called spatial and this is the same thing as the previous dimension, but it actually describes the spatial position of objects in space.

The third dimension is called spatial and we can think of this as the location of a particle within a spatial plane. So in terms of a particle, a point on our line can be considered as the position of the particle within our 3+1 dimensional plane.

Let's now consider the behavior of a particle that is initially at rest (stationary). Since it is a point that is fixed at a certain position in space, any time it is moved in one direction, we would see it move in the direction of that direction (or say, straight up in the X direction!). If we moved this particle back and forth in the same direction, we would see this motion repeat forever!

It can be very confusing to think about all this for yourself - but we'll leave that to you! Now

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the concepts of dimension travel as the main focus of this chapter, here is a very brief review of how the world of creation came into being. According to science, the universe was created by the Creator of the Universe - in other words, God, an entity beyond our understanding that is eternal. As a way to symbolize what God would be like in our world, we refer to Him as the Creator of the Universe. But what happens to God when we die? In the Book of Genesis, God tells us that "one day, after a great earthquake, he called the earth and all the waters together, and said, 'Go to your places, and rest until I call you.'"

In order for our planet to become habitable, water was needed to grow crops and generate electricity. So all the people of the land began to gather around each other and form villages. Unfortunately, one night the earth came crashing down as a storm. Since God is the creator of the universe, he wanted to ensure that the earth wouldn't collapse onto themselves at any time! So he began constructing the pyramids. Over the centuries, the pyramids grew taller and taller until they reached the dimensions of the sky! The pyramids were then known as the Great Pyramids. The pyramids were then used as a prison for the captives of the Pharaohs.

The great Pharaoh, Anu, was one of those captives - he was made to work at the Great Pyramid. During the day time, Anu worked on the pyramid and in the dark he worked on the Great Pyramid's gates. Sometimes the Great Pyramid even moved! According to myth, Anu and his colleagues managed to find the gates of the Great Pyramid by using their "glue hands." The gate finally collapsed as a result and left behind the Great Pyramid.

Now let me introduce you to a character that comes to the fore in the Book of Genesis: the savage, cunning, and ruthless Sargon of Akkad. During his time as king, he worked hard to construct more and more of the Great Pyramids with his hands! The Great Pyramids were eventually so tall and large that they began to look like the heavens themselves! It was only a few generations later that Sargon decided to use their size and strength to force all the Egyptians to leave their native land. However, this was a mistake! As Sargon realized later on, the Egyptians loved his Great Pyramids so much that they decided to keep them and build one of their own! So as a result, the Great Pyramid that Sargon built took the form of a human being! The Great Pyramid's golden mouth was known as Sargon's Eye.

Now before you ask what happened to Sargon, let me remind you that he was not just a terrible king. One day he made a promise to the god who gave birth to him. He promised that he would never destroy the Great Pyramid or let go of his right hand. In return, the god gave him the ability to travel through space and time. Sargon was one of the first beings on Earth who could travel through three dimensions. That ability later came to be known as the Sargonian Dimension.

Sargon began travelling to different parts of the world every month. Once he finished his journey, he returned to his royal dwelling with his eyes closed. The next day he would awaken with a fresh new eye. He did this for seven days, but eventually his eyes were worn out and he could no longer use their power. After seven days, he would wake up with a very sad, sad look on his face. He could see no reason for his sadness.

In his final moments, he wanted all of his followers to know how sad he was. He wanted them to know that when he had a new vision, it would be of his eyes. He would never, ever let go of his hand and would never destroy the Great Table! As a result, his followers took every opportunity to talk to him in their various forms - they would say, "Thank you Lord for your kind words; it was very good to see you."

After all, Sargon was a great king. He also had a big heart. It is very hard for people to understand such a kindhearted person, but he was actually a very good person! The problem is that, as our friends described above, Sargon had a big ego! When he had his eye fixed, he started to use his great power to gain power over all of those who followed him. People started to believe that Sargon could somehow "walk through the Great Table"! Even people who believed in the Lord of the Universe thought that the Great Table was actually a symbol for Sargon's power!

Sargon's last message to his people was a very interesting one. He would say, "You are no longer on this earth and so you are no longer my subjects. I will let you return to your native land, but you will not return with me. No matter how fast you move, you will never be able to return."

If you were to ask what does it mean for Sargon to let go of his right and use his power to gain power over his people, the answer would be that he did it because he knew that he was no longer in control of the human race. He also knew that his power was gone, and that in the end, his followers would return to their native land, and that the Great Table was no longer there....

As a side note, I would like to mention that one of the very first things Sargon did as king was to make the Great Table a pyramid. It was because the Great Table symbolized the throne of the God! And because of this, when people believed in God, they were supposed to pray to God to give them strength - power and power to be able to live and rule without worry! And that is how our Sargonian society developed into what is called the Pyramid society!


Chapter Thirty Seven
The Great Eye of Sargon

Now that we have a little knowledge of Sargon and the world that he was in, let's move on to the Great Eye of Sargon...this is one of the most important and mystical objects in the whole Sargonian history! It is said that at the time the Great Eye first appeared, it was not a regular eye, it was an extremely strong one. Sargon called this eye "The Great Eye," and the Great Eye remained hidden from mortal eyes for more than a million years before it was finally revealed to us. Once in the human form, the Great Eye is called "the Great Eye of Sargon," and it can be described as an extraordinary eye! And although there is no way of knowing exactly what it looks like, it seems to be extremely powerful, and is capable of performing amazing feats!

Now here's a quick recap of the story: In the Book of Genesis we meet Sargon the Great - the man that invented the Great Pyramids and conquered all of Egypt. Sargon, after conquering Egypt and the Egyptians, was in the process of destroying the Great Pyramid at Giza. The Great Eye was hiding there

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the concepts and theories discussed in the last chapter, I'll give you one of my favourite novels, The Cursed Child by Stephenie Meyer (read more about the book here!). This book is extremely complex and dense, but it does have a lot of fun to read and will get the kids thoroughly excited about the concepts! I'll skip ahead to the end and show you a few short videos to help you follow along!
What happens when we create a new object called "Node"? Let's say we create a new object, called Node, that represents a computer network of nodes. So we enter this node as a new Node object, assigning it an "id" of "1".

Now let's create a new Node called "Node 1", and assign it an "id" of "1". Then we could now start to create the network of nodes that would represent all of our computers. If we click the "Create Network" button, this new Node object would be created. All of the nodes in our network would start to "function", using their "id" and their "created" timestamp as parameters. This would create a chain of new nodes - this is how new computer network's are created. In essence, new nodes could be created by selecting the "create network" button, and clicking on the network's "name". We can then specify their "created" timestamp.

Now we can do a little bit more than that, and create our own computer network. This is done by choosing "create network" again, and assigning a name to our created network that contains the string "SomeName". We could use a little bit of randomness here to decide what the name should actually be. For example, if we wanted to add our own domain name - like "some-domain.com" - we could assign the name "SomeName".

Finally, we can select "create node" and create a new node. The node would receive an "id" of "1". This node then will be "functioning," using its "id" and its "created" timestamp.

How do we know when a node is functioning? Let's say it has entered into a "State 1", and then is working. In this case, we know it can function because it can "read" data from the database, and use that data to update it. But what does the "State 1" actually mean? To tell you the truth, this concept is incredibly complicated and we will never get to the point in the story where we know exactly what it represents! In short, in order for a node to be functioning, it has to be in one of the following states.

1 - Operational - the node can use data from the database.
2 - Ready - The node can read data from a file.
3 - Recurring - The node can read a database record, but will only do so in certain intervals of time - this can be anything from hours, weeks, months, years, or centuries.
4 - Pausing - This is when the node's processing capabilities are paused - this is where it gets stuck in one of these states.

Now let's say that node 2 is functioning, but node 3 doesn't. What is it going to do? If node 2 had entered a "State 2", then node 3 could still "function", and we would know it was functioning because it can read the "State 2" node's data, but not the "State 1" data. However, we don't know that this particular node has entered a "State 2" - because we haven't actually read it yet! In other words, it's possible that when we first see the "SomeName" node's data on the "State 2" node, we might think it is functioning, but if we don't actually read the "State 2" data ourselves, then it might not be!

So we can see in the following example that a new computer network could come into being by simply clicking on the "create network", and entering a name that contains "SomeName". Then we can select "create" and create a new computer network. By doing this, we can actually create a "virtual" computer network - one that can be "functioning" without actually creating a "physical" network.

So what's the real problem with this concept? Well, the problem with it is that it seems to be overly complex and too vague. In a nutshell, we don't know exactly what the "State 2" is, and how it works! If we had written some paper on this subject in school, I think we'd get some pretty confusing answers!

Now that we know a little bit more about the "State 1" concept in relation to the "State 2" concept, let's discuss one of the more famous ideas in information theory: coding. This is basically the study of how information can be encoded in a more efficient and less error-prone way! It's a very old idea, but there are a number of people who still believe that the best way to represent information is to use binary numbers.

Coding has it's origins in the theory of Shannon who was a mathematician who studied information and communication theory. Shannon made the important observation that if you have data containing information (as represented by a number of bits), then there is a probability that information may be represented in the form of numbers. If you want to be more efficient in your coding, then you should take into consideration this probability, and assign a more efficient coding scheme to data.

The basic idea of coding is essentially this: You have data that contains information (here represented by binary numbers) that you want to transmit. If you transmit this data using any of many methods, the information in the data will be lost. The first way to make it more error-prone is to transmit the data in an encoded version. For example, if you transmit binary data, like 1 and 0, and a carrier wave, you can transmit this binary data in an encoded form. This way, all information in the data is lost - just the binary codes. But now you can decode this data (the data in encoded form) and know where it came from! This way you can tell who you are transmitting data to! The problem with this idea, of course, is that you don't know how many bits are encoded. If you have too many bits of information, then you can transmit more bits, and the data will be lost - this makes your method more efficient. Let's talk about how much information can be encoded in bits:

If you transmit 2 bits, for example, then it might be best to transmit one bit plus one bit. For example, if the length of the encoded data is three bits, then you would want to use just one bit plus two bits, because the information in the encoded data is three times as much as the data in the original data.

If the encoded data is four bits, you would use two bits plus one bit. If the encoded data is five bits, then you would need one bit plus three bits, and so on...

The original data was encoded so the information was spread so evenly across a lot of bits. Now instead, the information is spread just a little bit more evenly, and instead a little bit less evenly - it looks like it was spread over fewer bits!

This method of encoding is called "Decoding" - but how it does this is really unclear. In fact, it seems to be extremely random, and is sometimes impossible to understand.

So how is

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the concept of dimensions we have introduced in our chapter on dimensions in mathematics above, we will use this cartoon.

Let's imagine a man named Magic Mike. Like many other men (even though he is a male), he has a great deal of talent in the craft of magic. One of his best tricks is to change his appearance in very subtle ways. What if we made him look like a girl? He could literally become a man, and we could even change his name into something that we like! We might even get a woman! Or we could even have the man be a man! Well, I think we'll take a look at this...

Let's create some 3D objects. Using Blender we will create our 3D objects as simple shapes - this should be easy! But this is not a great time to be worrying about details - the object that we will create will need to be very, very simple to begin with! Let us call this object Mike! We'll name it something that we like and will use the object as the starting point for our new creation. The name that we choose will be Mike. So at this point in our creation process, we will start with our default name of Mike!

Now, let's add some detail to Mike! We'll create two eyes in Mike - one on the left and one on the right. We'll also create a mouth in Mike as well, to look more like a man. We'll add a nose as well, so that it resembles a man! At this point, Mike looks like a man! Let's create a face and a mouth using the same way as we created the eyes and the nose! We'll now add a forehead and we'll also add a hand! These hands are created using the same way we created the forehead and the nose! Let's now add a face and a mouth - and we'll also add a nose! Finally, we'll create the eyes and the nose using the same way we did the mouth! Let's now create the mouth - with this object we'll create a mouth that looks like a woman's mouth! Let's create a hand and we'll also add a chin! Let's now add a hand and we'll also create a chin! We can now create a foot and we will also add a toe! Let's now create a foot and we'll also add a ankle! And now we're done! Let's just add the hands and feet, and we'll call the whole thing a new version of Mike! We are now ready to go! Let's open our new creation! Let's go into the browser and start the creation process! Let's change the name of our new creation to Mike and start creating his new appearance!

We just created our creation, and now let's go out and find some magic to make us look like a girl! To begin our search, we'll just click on a link that points to an old version of Mike that we created in a previous life. This old version of Mike will appear in the new creation, where we now have the possibility to change his body by changing the color of his hair and changing his hair color.

We will need a little bit of magic to change our hair color. If we click on the link that points to our old version, then we will be taken to a page where we can change the hair color of Mike! The option that we are using is called "skin color". This is the default value of the skin option for new creation. We have two colors that we can choose from - red or blue. Clicking on the red color changes Mike's skin into his default color - red! Clicking on the blue color changes Mike's skin to his default color - blue! So that we can compare these two options, let's take a look at how the new version of Mike looks now! In our new version of Mike, we will have a new version of Mike wearing blue hair! This hair is created by changing the hair color of our created version of Mike. Here's our red and blue hair choices:

Well, you see that we've created a new version of Mike, who has blue hair! The hair color of our new version of Mike was created by changing the color of hair that we created in our previous life! We can now look around the room and see that our new creation is much different from our old creation! It's a completely different personality - one that looks much more like a woman! So what do we do now? How can we really change our appearance? Well, we have one small trick! Let's start by creating a new version of Mike as a man! Let's open the browser and change his name back to Mike! Let's change the color of his hair using the color option that we just created in our previous life, and then we can start to change his appearance!

We have changed our name, and we have now created a new version of our creation! Let's now open the browser and add the new version of our creation to a list! We will also need to do this to get Mike to show up in our previous life! Let's open our existing life by clicking on it and choosing a time to save our life on our computer! You can now see the other version of Mike that we just created in previous life, where we did the same changes as we did to our current creation! Let's open that copy of our life to see the new creation! And how wonderful is it! Let's just take a look at the hair color of our newly created version of Mike! Our creation is now completely red and blue! We can now choose between two colors - red or blue. Now let's try our new version of Mike's hair! Click on the blue option in order to change it into blue! And now our new creation will show up on our computer!

It's a very simple thing - just select two colors from our color pallet, and we'll be able to change our hair color using a simple tool! We can now switch between the two options, red and blue, to create an entirely different, yet very interesting look! And now our new version of Mike is ready to go! Let's now go back to our new creation! We can now open our new creation and change its name back to Mike! It's now time to start making our new version of Mike look like a man! Let's just go back to the color pallet and switch between the two options again - red and blue! Let our new version of Mike become a real man! Let's now add our hands and feet, and let's add our nose! Let's also create the eyes and the mouth again! Let's now add our new version of Mike to the world again! Let's now open the creation that we've created in our previous life again, and we'll now see that the new version of Mike is already dressed in his new clothes! Now, we will now take a look at what the new version of Mike really looks like! This is our last version of Mike - we're just going to make sure it looks like a real person! Let's take a look at the new version of Mike's looks now! It's just really amazing! Let's now change the skin color and hair color, and let's create a new version of Mike that we can now actually interact with!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the Meadow Mage's adventures and the adventures of her friends, here is a map illustrating the various dimensions she inhabits and the locations of the various magical items that represent the various elements of her life: the Meadow Mages' home world of Earth; the world of magic; and her home world of Yveline, where the Meadow Mages reside and where she grows her magical trees.

Before we get into the plot, though, let us get a little more familiar with the world of Yveline. In Yveline, there is a magical society known as the Meadow Mages. This magical society is responsible for the creation of the Meadow Mages Garden. As we have seen throughout this chapter, this magical society comprises the Meadow Mages, the Meadow Mages Guild, and an official council of Mages known as the Royal Council. In Yveline the Meadow Mages are able to live in their home world - Earth's space - while their magic works on Yveline, which is within Earth's space. The magical trees that are planted in Yveline are actually controlled by the Meadow Mages and are designed to symbolize each of the seven elements of the universe (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Light, and Metal) - these seven magical trees represent the seven different parts of the universe. The Meadow Mages Guild works closely with the Royal Council to make sure each magical tree grows in a unique way in order to symbolize one of the seven elements of creation. The Meadow Magi Guild also maintains a library, in which the Meadow Mages study the magical literature from the time they were young to learn more about their magic and to use it for their benefit! The Meadow Mages garden, on the other hand, is their home world and is a forest that grows all of their magical trees in. However, it is also their magical refuge, a place in which the Meadow Mage Guild and the royal council can be safe.

Now in order for you to fully appreciate the plot and the characters, let us get to work. Let's start with the plot! The Meadow Mage is a young woman called Thea who is a part of the Meadow Mage Guild. She is a daughter of the Meadow Magi and lives with her family on the Meadow Mages planet Earth. Her father, Lord Melisandre of the Meadow Mage Guild, is a high-ranking member of the royal council. In this chapter we also meet the other two Meadow Mage Guild members: The Gladiator and the Fire Mage, as well as Thea's other brother, Celeborn, the Fire Mage's younger son, and Thea's best friend, the Ice Mage. Celeborn and the Gladiator each have powers from different elements - while the Gladiator is a sword wielding fire mage, the Fire Mage is a water mage who also has the power of fire, while the Ice Mage is an air mage who has the power of water as well! These elements allow Thea to use them in order to fight the various threats she encounters as she lives among the Meadow Mages!

What makes Thea unique as an member of the Meadow Maged Guild is that she doesn't have a home world within Earth. In her home world she lives in the Meadow Mages garden and grows her magical trees. As she grows up, Thea learns that her father and brother were both members of the Meadow Mage guild and that they both left their home world for the Meadow Mages world. Thea also learns from her friend the Gladiator that her brother Celeborn is also a member of the guild. She also finds out that she was born into a family that had long ago left Earth to live among the Meadow Magos. She grows up surrounded by the magical trees of her Meadow Mage home world and the magical literature she was taught by her Meadow Mages father when she was young.

Now let's move on to the characters of the Meadow Mage, Thea, her family, and the Magic Tree. Let's begin with Thea. This young woman is the only member of her family that isn't a Meadow Mage - her father died when she was a very young child, and her mother has since passed away from a mysterious illness that she has never had. Thea grows up in the Meadow Mage Garden surrounded by her magical trees, and she is an expert on them. She is the leader of the Meadow MAGES Guild and can be contacted through their magic tree, the Meadow Mage tree. She is also in the process of developing her magic so that it can be utilized for the benefit of the Meadow Mags on Earth. For those of you who haven't yet read The Witch of the Mountain, I highly recommend it! There are other books by the author, but I didn't know them when I was writing this chapter, so I wasn't able to include them in the guide! If you really want a quick review of the book, click here for The Witch of the Moon: A Young Man Who Bows Down to Power

The next person in my list of characters is The Gladiator, the mage who has the most magical weapon of all - The Magic Sword! The Gladiator is a member of the royal council, and he has to rely heavily on the magical literature he has in his library. He is extremely loyal to his king, who has given him the highest rank in the royal council, the Black King. In addition, his sword is the only magical weapon that can be used on Earth. It is a very dangerous sword, so it is extremely important that the Gladiator learns how to use it properly. He has been teaching his younger brother Celeborn how to use this magic weapon at their Meadow Mages garden. In the book, they discuss how Celeborn has been able to use the sword, and how he could also use it to protect his family if he were to encounter an evil force.

The third character is Celeborn, the Gladiator's younger son. Like his father, Celeborn is also very loyal to his father and to the Black King. Celeborn's magical sword is a two-handed sword, which is different than his father's sword in that it is equipped with the power of light. While Celeborn's father's sword is just about as dangerous as The Gladiator's sword, because it is a two-handed weapon, Celeborn has to know how to use it to protect him and his family in case he were to come face-to-face with something like an evil force - a magic monster.

Finally, the final character is Thea's best friend and fellow Meadow Mage, the Ice Mage, whom I won't give too much detail on. She is also a member of The Gladiator's team, and she does all the fighting for her team. She is an extremely skilled fighter who is also very loyal to her family. In the novel, she tells the readers that she did all of the fighting in the beginning of the novel, because it was a tough fight to kill people so that they might die. However, she was forced to take part in this because her parents were in a big battle trying

### Chapter Thirty Six
## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the mystery of human evolution will be resolved by the end of the next book... and it's not a good one, either! To make matters worse, my brother and his girlfriend have made plans to move their new home and job into a different dimension, which is the highest they have been able to go since they were little. Their intention is to move there because of their mother, and the fact that they've met each other there by chance (and not in a dream)! However, the strange thing is, my brother is still in his own dimension, and is perfectly happy there! He's even made friends there, which is a bit odd considering that we were told that they were a different type of person due to their inability to communicate with one another in their native dimension!
So what happens next... What does my brother and his girlfriend want to do next, or who knows what else is going on?

Unfortunately, we will only just begin to find out as we read in book three. In order to help us all understand the story better, we will have to work our way through a few chapters of our brother's first book before beginning the third book in this series!

As with the first book, we are introduced to The Man From Dimension X through a young boy named Ray, who falls in love with The Man. Eventually, we learn that Ray's father has been taken by my brother and his girlfriend in their journey into Dimension X, which explains their strange behaviour towards one another. As we continue to learn about The Man's past, we will see that there are many mysteries surrounding him and his girlfriend, and how they can even be friends in different dimensions! For now, we will just let you know that this mystery is going to be a bit of a long and interesting read....

So it's time to go on a journey. Let's start with our brothers, who are planning to fly into Dimension X. Of course, I have to say, we were hoping and praying that they would get lost in this huge, vast, and very hot, dense, and very cold, and incredibly hostile galaxy. However, it's not so much they fly through space as it's that they fly into another dimension. Well, at least that is what my brother and his girlfriend told us! To see that fact in action, lets have a look at a few pictures of them in Dimension X:

So what would they have to survive in Dimension X? Not quite everything, but at least you can assume they're not just going to be living in an alien world. In a way, I actually like their appearance, they are very beautiful! However, we learn that the thing they were most prepared for and dreamed of was to actually be able to communicate with other beings in Dimension X through the telepathic energy that they had inherited from their mother... 

As we continue our journey into Dimension X, we will learn that there is a secret chamber hidden underground under the city. The chamber is filled with water and the water can be consumed by waterbeards. Of course, waterbeards cannot communicate in other dimensions, but they have a unique ability to "walk" through a dimensional vacuum! The waterbeards would be able to travel along different dimensions, just as they can when traveling through Time, but I suspect we will only get to see this capability in book four.

I can see a few possibilities here; how would they travel through the chamber, and what are the other unknowns surrounding The Man? What would they be able to do in Dimension X? Could they even see the light of their day here? Let's get down to the nitty-gritty of the story and find out!

Now before we get into that, it is important to note that in my brother and his girlfriend's book, the story is more "romantic" in nature than in the first book! That makes sense, as these characters are not just a couple of characters, and we get to see the love, chemistry, and devotion between them!
So when they first meet, we have the story of both of their lives before, during, and after their first meeting. My brother explains how he ended up losing his job and his girlfriend left him to die for him! So it seems like they can talk about their troubles without being awkward, so we don't have to feel like we're being forced to watch as we read in detail about their history!
However, we learn that Ray was brought up as a waterbeard by the waterbeards of his own dimension! But apparently the waterbeards had no idea that Ray was a human...or even that The Man was a human at all!! And, you guessed it, this is where the mystery comes in! As we learn more about the first meeting between Ray and The Man, we will learn how they became friends, and learn why Ray chose to become a waterbeard! However, it looks like our friendships were only going to last a moment, as Ray is still caught between their past and their dreams.

So let's move on to their journey through Dimension X. For a start, they have to find their way into Dimension X by swimming, and this takes them several days! In order to move through Dimension X, it is important that they can actually walk through the vacuum created by a super strong magnetic field that separates the two dimensional worlds. So it seems that Ray is going to be stuck there for a while - or maybe not!

The last thing I would like to note before we move on to book four is that a couple of other people will be part of this trip - and I am sure you all have an interesting and interesting story to tell about that! What does your brother and his girlfriend do with them? Would they live with them at the time of their death?

I would like to say that they would be living with them, but for some reason, I am not sure how. We will have to read a couple of chapters in order to find out more! If you don't want to wait a bit more, please read a few other books and see what my brother and his friends have been up to over the years!
So, what do you think about the first book? I really do appreciate your input and thoughts!

The final chapter in the book will be a bit different from the rest of the story, and it will be a bit of a cliffhanger! My brother and his girlfriend have already been through a lot, but they are about to face the most dangerous adventure they've ever faced...the biggest change of their lives! Now I hope you are prepared for it!...

So I know that the book will be quite strange and exciting to read, and will be a bit confusing at first! It's going to require a lot of reading, but you can't say that you are not prepared for it! If you want to see where my brother and his girlfriend are going, I recommend starting with book two - it is not only a book about Dimension X, but it is also a story about a whole world and a bunch of characters! I hope that you will be able to enjoy it and enjoy the stories!
And finally, remember: I am sorry for my brother and his girlfriend! I know that they have a lot of things going on in their lives, but I don't want to make them feel like they are alone at the end!
