## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the only way that we can ever understand more about reality is by traveling through space-time. However, if we can't travel through that 4D fabric to see the underlying geometry of things, then we must either make very strange analogies to make sense of space-time or start to build a foundation of science that is less reliant on geometry.

Let's start with the most obvious question of all - in what ways does Balenciaga differ from the rest of the big brands? Let's begin by examining just a few aspects of this brand.

The logo itself. This logo (the "Ball") has been modified many times over it's history. The first version was a very simple symbol of a basketball (which is an analog of the earth). The second version was a ball that is drifting in space, whereas the last version is a ball of fire that is completely encircled by flames - making it resemble a supernova.

The color choice.
One may ask why a brand whose logo is mostly a basketball would make an attempt to make color change throughout it's history. This question has a very deep root in psychology, so we'll focus on a few aspects we think might be useful for explaining this choice.

The blue color choice.
One theory says that blue represents calmness, so we might choose blue in our logo to reflect this. The Blueprint brand has gone so far as to make it appear as if they are flying over a rainbow!

Green color choice.
Another theory says that green represents harmony - so we might choose green to reflect this. This theory takes the Greenville brand, whose color scheme seems to be quite green and floral during the day and white and pastel at night. This color choice seems to capture the harmony of nature much better than the Balls brand's color choice.

One of the reasons why we chose blue is because when you view a Balenciaga logo from space it seems like it's part of a ball. In addition, we believe that some of the more recognizable colors in our culture (black, red, white and gold) are the colors that reflect the basic principles of science and technology - so using color in our logo to make sense of space-time is probably one of the best ways to do this.

Other considerations.
While many of these brand considerations are obvious, we believe there may be others as well. We'll briefly introduce other concepts you might not want to miss here. Of course, any brand decisions ultimately come down to the personalities of the business owners.
If you are looking for creative ideas and inspiration, try searching for "Life as a Brand" on google.

A:

Here are a few general ideas I came across.
1) A logo should be a single symbol that conveys your message in a way that is easy to visualize as well as relate to what the brand represents. I find symbols like a triangle, a star, and a ball to be great. (See also How I Made It In Logo Design).

2) The colors should be clear to avoid confusion and ensure maximum perception of the brand. When designing a brand logo, I try to stay away from flashy or colors that may cause confusion, such as color schemes or bright fonts. 

3) The brand logo should not only reflect the brand identity, but also the brand philosophy. For instance, an umbrella brand logo should reflect the brand's philosophy behind each umbrella.

4) I try to incorporate different brand colors in an image, because I find it easy to visualize colors in an image using a computer software. The more colors you use, the better!

5) Another idea you can use in your brand logo design are multiple images in a single bitmap file, so in your browser, you can open several images and work with them at the same time, without having to open each for each one.  

6) Creating a brand logo might involve a unique design or a combination of some other elements, but as I explained in the intro, each of those ideas may be useful individually and when combined with other elements such as fonts and colors. For example, one idea might be a simple design combined with a strong word like "Patience" (with a strong font) while the image of your logo might be a combination of words and images that express your brand culture to the world around you at once. 

A:

My understanding is that the designer can create a brand logo using a variety of approaches, such as a logo which is entirely based on the brand color palette (for example, a red, orange, or red logo may use that color scheme), and in addition, a logo which includes the brand's logo, images, or a combination of all of these elements, and which is designed to make sense of the brand's products and/or its vision by focusing on the brand's philosophy, mission statements, and values.

A:

I think I can answer your question.  As you are traveling from spatial to temporal, you cannot go back if you want to enter a different reality, no matter how many dimensions you encounter - your reality is one dimensional and your reality from which all other realities are emanates from that dimensional space. 
Thus, if you want to enter a different reality, you must enter a new dimension.  If you do not leave the spatial dimension, you must find

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the universe is all we have is a bunch of particles, and they all seem to have a very specific way of interacting with each other - something very different from us. But then we turn to an old school book to help flesh out our understanding of how the universe actually works, and then this book becomes a new textbook! The main thing we will use in this chapter is the concept of categories - a term that refers to the way in which the universe is organized and organized - so we can better understand how particle systems work in our 3D universe.

Let me give you an example to help illustrate what category theory is all about. If you are a philosopher, well, you're probably familiar with the notion of a subject (a concept that is usually related to mathematical concepts) - like your hand, a person, etc. A subject is a thing that is subject to something called the law of nature. (We will use this term later on when discussing how categories help define objects in physics.)

Now consider the following question: what is the law of nature governing the behavior of particles in a 4D universe as they undergo motion over time?

In other words, let's try to answer the question a bit differently from how philosophical philosophers usually do it - instead of thinking about the law of nature as a set of rules that govern the behavior of every particle based on its location in the 4D universe, we are going to consider the law of nature as a general mathematical concept - a concept that can be used to describe not only the behavior of particles in a 4D universe, but also other mathematical objects (like numbers and words in our everyday language), etc...

Let’s say we have an object called a book, and a subject called a person. The person is the object that can talk about books. Let's say we also have an additional object called a bookshelf that is part of the same book. This bookshelf acts like a bookstore - it keeps a variety of books in a space that would normally be a library or museum! Now in our bookstore, each of the books can either be in its own section, or be part of a variety of "themes" (e.g. religious, political, historical). In other words, when we refer to a book, we usually mean a variety of different books (the most common example is a novel, since each book is composed of several distinct sections!)

So the objects that participate in these various topics - books, books shelves, etc - are all classified under a very specific category - this is called a subject. In other words, the law of nature governs the behavior of the subject, and each object is governed by some specific laws that govern its behavior as a whole - the law of nature. It also helps that the subject and category theory are both mathematically precise - that is, they both have a mathematical definition, and are completely precise about what constitutes a subject and a category.

Now let's say that someone came up with a very interesting idea - to understand how to design a physical device that would follow the law of nature...a mathematical concept! That's exactly what he did and has done since then!...(I am not actually claiming here that this was his idea - it could have been anybody else's, which I don't agree with.) To start designing a physical device that could be used to follow the law of nature, we need to define one or more categories: objects that can be used as subjects and/or as categories, and, in this case, objects that can be used both as subjects and as categories. We will do this in detail in chapter thirty-six...

Now lets consider how a physical device might behave if the designer were able to follow the laws of nature - these laws govern how objects behave as they move and interact over time. For example, if someone were to create a device that could be used to follow the law of nature, then they could use the laws of physics to drive a car, and then use those laws to drive a basketball or ice hockey - the car could take an accelerating "drive" to reach an appropriate speed before it hits an object. (Note: It does not mean that if an accelerating car leaves an "exit" in the middle of driving, then that car will always be able to reach the exit because it can't travel backwards in time! But it does mean that a car needs to travel forward in time, to avoid hitting something at the exit!)

Let's try to provide an example of how the creator of a device might describe how he would implement this concept. If he follows the laws of physics and uses the "accelerate to stop," then his device could, theoretically, take on the shape of an "apple". After the device leaves the object it is traveling through, just like the car does when it comes to stopping. As long as they maintain the shape, their device will be able to follow the laws of nature, without crashing or taking on an "apple" shape! And this is simply because their device is part of a larger set of devices (like the car, the basketball, and the ice hockey) that act similar to its parent.
In other words, if someone wants to create a device that could follow the law of

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the universe is not perfect. In this section we will be exploring the strange and seemingly contradictory concept of nipples. As we get closer to reality, some people have started to say that reality is better depicted by a 3D version of our hands rather than 2D ones (which can cause a little confusion!).

In the first section of the book, we tried to explain to our readers that people are trying to communicate with some sort of consciousness that is at least as advanced as ours, but that doesn't mean that our minds can't represent reality in all sorts of ways! Now let's take a look at some of the theories of how this process can actually happen.

As previously stated, the concept of nipples dates back to ancient times. Since ancient times there have been some sort of differences between the way the hands and other bodies are depicted in paintings and drawings. This is particularly the case for the hands of the nude (who are supposed to communicate with something that is hidden).

In the 12th century, when the painter Leonardo da Vinci painted his Mona Lisa, he used a 3D version of his hand that wasn't meant to be the actual Mona Lisa's hands (because the Mona Lisa is a male). However, it was a 3D version of his hand that was used to accurately represent the Mona Lisa's actual features - for example his features in a pose that is commonly attributed to her.

Now it's the famous Mona Lisa paintings - especially The Angelus Novus - that have been taken so seriously that they are used as a propaganda tool to try and change the way the world views women in general (and, to a certain extent, the world as a whole!

Over the last several hundred years, there have been some theories that try to explain when this discrepancy occurs. These theories go from saying that it's intentional or the result of someone creating an imperfect image of a woman in order to deceive us into thinking that we have an imperfect knowledge of reality, to calling it a sign of the times...

And of course there is the theory that the nude actually really comes from a male...or perhaps a male and female being with each other...

As with anything else in the world, different people have various theories as to what causes such inconsistencies between our different perception of reality. One thing we're all agreed on is that we want to be able to explain the origin of anything! As was the case with the Mona Lisa, we have a tendency to believe that people have created a perfect image of reality, which may, or may not, be true...but I'm really only interested in the science of reality itself!

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what is going on within the brain, let's take a look at this wonderful mathematical model called the Enforcing Neuro-Functional Loop (ENFL). ENFL has a very important role in understanding human cognition. The basic idea that we will take a look at now is that some brain-based functions (such as remembering numbers, reading words, etc) can be implemented using a computational method we call learning.
Let's think about a situation where a cat runs through a tree, and the tree is covered in leaves (i.e., leaves are the basis upon which a concept will be stored). If the cat were to enter the tree directly without ever touching anything more than a stick, then he would not be able to make the right decision. So instead, the cat would rely upon its brain as a "supervisor," and it would start looking at the leaves to find out where it's starting from...this is a very simple concept. However, if a cat were to look directly at the tree, and the tree were to be hidden behind leaves, then the cat would have to rely on another brain function that is very useful in understanding the tree - the knowledge that it is hidden behind leaves. But because the cat is constantly thinking about other things, it would use this knowledge of what is hidden behind the tree to help make the correct decision. As we continue to learn, the cat becomes more fluent in this technique, and eventually he becomes able to learn how to navigate through a forest entirely without touching any leaves. We can really begin to understand the key components of ENFL - the central component is how different patterns are stored by the brain - this pattern is stored in the brain as a neural code called a neuro-code. Once a neuro-code is defined, then a series of rules that govern that code can be formulated.
Now let's return to our cat example. When the cat starts running, his brain begins to look for patterns with certain characteristics. Then once he finds these patterns, he starts to memorize them and learn how to use them to help solve future problems. This is the basic concept underlying the ENFL model. But now let's think about what happens during the rest of the run. When the cat enters the tree directly, it begins to search for patterns in the leaves without touching anything. At this moment the cat has a completely different concept of what is hidden behind the tree. Now it doesn't look at the tree in the exact same way, nor does the tree look at it the same way. Instead, the cat is constantly thinking of the tree, and the concept of trees becomes more and more dominant in his brain, building this information into a neuro-code. Now this neuro-code is ready to be used when it is needed - the cats neural code can be used to help the cat understand the concepts behind the wood - it helps him discover which trees are hidden behind the trees to use in solving future problems. You might think this isn't very helpful for cats - imagine if all animals had a similar neural code to help them understand each other! Well, no! If an animal were to constantly use its neural code to tell other animals how to move through the forest, then all animals would find it useless to know how to navigate an entire forest; they'd be confused about their own species and would become extinct at some point in time! So this neuro-code helps the animal understand other animals - this is the power of the ENFL model!

Now we can go back to our cat example and see the way ENFL works. The cat starts to "learn" the concept of the tree and the hidden trees, and then starts to develop this information into a "neurocoding". Once a neuro-code is established, it is stored by the brain for later use - we call it a "brain representation." Once the neural code is fully formed, this brain representation begins to function. Once it is used, it is stored in long-term memory for future recall. Using this knowledge, the cat can use a similar neuro-code to retrieve all the hidden trees behind the tree he is currently exploring - this helps him move through the forest without touching any leaves.

Now let's say we just walked in front of the cat - now that it's been walking around a lot more, it has gained experience with trees, and therefore the neural code for trees is more developed. By studying the trees in the forest, it no longer needs to rely on a single neuro-code to help himself remember what is hidden behind the tree. Instead, the entire forest is now a neuro-code, and it becomes more and more powerful as it develops. So the cat is able to navigate much more quickly and easily through the forest, without encountering any of the hidden trees that would cause him to be confused.
But what was the specific purpose behind the use of the brain representation? Because the cat is able to remember the tree behind the tree he was exploring, the brain represents the tree behind the tree so that when it is needed for future recall, the cat simply needs to look up the neuro-code that stores the particular tree. 
Now lets think about how this concept relates to our brain. In our modern world, we know that there are lots of things we need to

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive processes we use to acquire intelligence, Mathematicians developed a concept called the Enfield Number Field (ENFF).
According to the theory, intelligence is primarily a combination of the mental skills required for mathematical computations. Mathematicians defined this to be a single, unchanging set of knowledge called number fields. In fact, it is possible to have one set of knowledge - as the number field is - apply it to many different scenarios and solve many different problems. From a purely mathematical perspective, it's a natural conclusion that more intelligent people (who should naturally have a higher number of knowledge fields) would generally be less affected by time dilation (an effect that we will not discuss further for now). However, there's a more complex explanation behind this, and we've covered some of it in the previous chapter!

Now let's examine what makes some people better at numbers than others. It's important to note that many people, including mathematicians, are born with a predisposition towards solving some sort of mathematical problem faster and better than others simply because they are more logical and logical people. When you start solving a problem, you usually get a certain, but vague feeling that your brain has identified and stored an answer, which means it was easier for you to recognize in advance if you had a certain set of knowledge to work from rather than if you'd just started randomly.

The next thing to know is that there are four different types of number fields (and not one), each with their own set of rules for solving problems efficiently and accurately. Now when it comes to reasoning, it seems that some people could be very good at a specific type of number field, but not all. For example, for problems involving algebraic numbers, we know that experts in the number group - especially experts in the field associated with solving problems involving algebraic numbers - can do much better than average people, yet others (such as adults with a general math IQ) still perform fairly well!  

Now that we know some of the rules that govern how mathematicians think and how experts in particular solve mathematical problems, we can try to draw some conclusions about how these properties affect mathematically talented individuals.

Now let us start by examining how people who are excellent at number field solving compare with people who are mediocre at number field solving. It turns out some people are good at number field solving, but not all - and some people can, and do, excel at a wider selection of number fields.
Let's say our previous number field solver, Charlie, has an IQ of 135. Then let's add a small bit of randomness by creating a new numerical value for the IQ of Charlie. If we were to increase Charlie's IQ by 1 percentage point, then it would become 135.05 - well above most people!
Similarly, let's imagine a person who has the best IQ ever, who suddenly takes a leap of faith by increasing his IQ by 4 percentage points. That person, in all probability, would be someone with an IQ of 130 or higher! Now what happens?  Well as long as our new IQ is above 130, then Charlie will probably not struggle so much with problem-solving.

Of course, it's still possible that our original number field solver, Charlie, could struggle a little more - that he might need to start slowly and then work his way up to higher IQs! But while we are on the subject of solving problems involving algebraic numbers, it seems that we don't usually worry about time dilation as compared to the same problem solving problems in other fields. Why? Well let's compare the way numbers are represented in different number fields...

For one thing, it's a mathematical fact that numbers in a certain type of number field are generally not numerically equivalent to numbers in another type of number field. That's because all numbers in a certain number field have to be multiplied by a fixed factor in order to be numerically equivalent to any number from another number field. Let's say the digits in our original number field were 1000,0000,0000,..., 1000000,000000 - and our original number field number is 1000000,0001,..., 100000000,000000.  Now let's put a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

To represent this in another one of our number fields, we would need to multiply 1000 by 10000.  But because 1000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 is a million digits, we'll have two numbers that we could use:

1000000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000..., which is only one of the 1000 digits of the original number field, 1000000

And
1000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,..., which is also a million digits, but which will always be a hundred times the 1000 digits of our original number field.
Now let's see how the new problem solver, Charlie, would represent

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our understanding of math, what better than to visualize the mathematical process we are working in? In this chapter we'll use some powerful visual aids (such as computer graphics and the like) to help clarify our understanding of math in the context of time! In the first section, we'll take a look at the basic shape of a number.

If we look closely, we can see that a number comes to life to help us understand mathematical processes, like multiplication. The concept of multiplication itself has a lot of complicated properties that go back quite a long time, but a simple number is all we need to know about it.

Let's look at the simple multiplication exercise again: If A and B are numbers, the multiplication product AB can be written as A * B and the product A times B can be written as AB. Let's simplify the multiplication operation and write it as the sum of two numbers: AB = A + B.

So far we have only seen the product of two single numbers. Now let's think about how to add two single numbers in the context of this multiplication question: Which number in A * B is A plus B? A simple answer is one of the numbers we just saw - 1 + A + B. However, we are only interested in multiplying by two numbers, not summing two numbers.

Let's try this again: If AB = 1 + A * B, which one of the AB numbers is A, and A + B = 1?

Note that we have already seen that (A + B) = A+B and A * B = 1 + A + B.  So A + B = 1 + A * B = 1 = A.

So now that we have an understanding of how multiplication works in the context of a single number, let's take it a step further: Let's multiply by any two numbers and look at the product of two single numbers. We'll find that this concept also applies to any number, like 4 + 3 + 9!

We're familiar with the multiplication formula AB = AB + A, so the summation formula for the product of two single numbers just works in the context of simple multiplication. Let's say AB = 2 + 2 + 4 = 4 + A, and let AB = A + B. Then A and B are now each a number of their own and so the summation formula simply tells us how to add two single numbers in a manner identical to how we solved the single-number multiplication problem we just discussed.
So how do we see a single number as a number within another number? Well, for a set of n numbers {x1, x2,..., xn}, if we view each number as an individual number within a set of n, then the product of any two given numbers in the set becomes the sum of those same two given numbers. Say AB = n + n (where n is the set of numbers in question) and we let A and B be the sets of those two numbers, then AB = n AB + A + B = n + n AB + n A + n B = n + n A + n B = A + 2*n B = A + 2*n + A + B

So as long as we can make this simple argument, then any two single numbers are in fact numbers within other single numbers! We could say that when we add two single numbers, those two single numbers are their individual values in the context of the other single numbers, and these single numbers then become their own number values within the set of this set of single numbers. We can therefore interpret numbers in conjunction with the set of their values as having some kind of internal logic, such as a single-number multiplication operation or a sum operation.

Since our two examples illustrate the relationship between the value of a single number and its set of values, what if we were to look at the values of all of the numbers in the universe as being part of the set of numbers of this particular single number?

That's one way to view the world of numbers - we believe that every single number is one of many possible values. And as we can see, the value of a single number is always related to the set of variables that make up that specific number! What an amazing, powerful concept!


Chapter Thirty Seven
Generalizing Mathematical Operations

In this chapter, we'll go back on from the beginning and apply some basic mathematical concepts as a way of understanding number concepts - to help prepare students for later multiplication, division problems, and the like.

Now let's start right at the beginning. Every single number is a set of numbers - a specific collection of numbers that we can use as a unit to take other numbers from. Let's call these the elements of that set of numbers. Let's say the set of numbers we work with: [0,1]. (Note: [0,1] is the set in which 0 has the lowest value and 1 the highest value. As mentioned above, any number that's equal to two or more of these 0, 1, and 1 is called a number of the set!)
When we look at a specific single number in our set, we can see that it represents a specific set of numbers, and we use this set to apply some basic operations to another set of numbers of the same structure.

Let's take a look at a more simple example

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mind of a Divine being, I will make use of mathematics to represent how we see and perceive the world around us. In mathematical terms, this means we use vectors and matrices to represent entities in our 3D reality; we also use vectors and matrices to represent our perceptual experiences. These vectors are the vectors that represent our locations in space and time (such as those in Figure 1), and these matrices represents our perceived world; vectors and matrices are a form of geometry that's central to physics and mathematics, so you'll see a lot of mathematical terms used here! Let's start with vectors, and how they are used to represent concepts in physics...

Let's also consider matrices (or the more formal form called matrices) as the mathematical representation of mathematical concepts - they are very useful for representing the shapes and patterns in objects and spaces! In a matrix, each row corresponds to a different vector, and each column corresponds to a different feature. You can always think of a matrix as a list of names, with each name corresponding to a particular shape, or location...so you can think of a matrix as a list of features! You could also think of a matrix as a list of names corresponding to attributes of characteristics that you would like to represent, such as "color", "hue", and "brightness"! But that is only a very simplistic view - think of a matrix as a list of attributes - you know all about geometry, but how can you describe things that have colors or attributes?

I will show you how this simple concept works by explaining how a 4D vector can be visualized using a 3+1 geometry to represent it...and how the same concept can be visualized using a 3+1 geometry to represent it in its entirety! Of course, the vector and matrix shown here are not actually real ones, but instead just a very visual example of how you can visualize a vector representing a 4D vector in terms of a 3+1 geometry to represent it...and vice versa! It is important to realize that the 3+1 geometry is very much like our everyday sense of vision - it represents images, rather than objects in the real world! We also called it 3+1 because it has one more dimension than our sense of vision, which makes it useful for a lot of things in physics and mathematics! In fact, as we will explore later, a 3+1 geometry is just a version of a 4D vector, just as our everyday sense of vision is a version of a 3D vector!

Let's now consider how a vector can be created using a 3+1 geometry, and how it is related to 4D vectors:

Now in physics, we often use the 3+1 formulation in math to describe complex vectors and tensors - for example: 

It is tempting to assume that these vectors are somehow connected. You could also think of them as being like "bricks and mortar" - there are two walls that are connected somewhere inside of it and are interconnected to form a 4D solid. But a 3+1 geometry is more complex; we don't always know where the connections go! And so this is where matrices play a significant part! We can see that there are several 3+1 geometries to represent each of these vectors!

Now let's consider the problem of knowing how to create a new 4D vector by simply connecting two 3D vectors together. We cannot always connect individual vectors - this won't create a new vector! But the problem is, all 4D vectors come from a 3+1 geometry, and any vectors that can't be connected to create a new 4D vector are called degenerate! In fact, every vector in 4D space is degenerate! Of course there are many factors that can affect which 3D vector we use to create a new 4D vector, and this is just one of them...but lets start with pure geometric reasons...and only look at geometrical reasons...at which 3+1 geometry we choose to draw the connection...and whether it meets the constraints we placed on the connection!

Let's first look at pure geometric features, such as angles and vectors... and how a geometry is drawn based on the space it occupies. In a three-dimensional vector we can rotate it in order to get the correct direction... in a 4D vector, you can create any vector by intersecting 4D vectors... but we can't create a new 4D vector if it is not in some space. To create the 3+1 dimension, we place all four of these vectors in the middle of one of the four 4D planes. Since 4D vectors are always connected because they are made up of all three of these vectors, all four of these vectors will meet one of these 4D planes, and since 4D planes are not connected together we call them degenerate!

In mathematics these degenerate 4D vectors were called "intersecting hyperspheres" - we could rotate them in order to get the best geometric interpretation...and there are many methods to find the best geometric interpretation... just as in the case of vectors in three dimensions - there are so many different ways to interpret the same thing depending on where you draw the line!

But things get interesting if we consider how a 4D vector is related to a 3+1 geometry! Let's make a

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts outlined in this chapter so clearly, we're going to present a simple example of mathematics where we use an ESFJ cognitive function to illustrate the concepts we cover here. Let's do this with the simple exercise:

The Problem - What is the biggest number?
Answer - It's probably the most important thing about the Universe...

The Problem - What is the biggest number?
Answer - It's probably the most important thing about the Universe...
Exercise

We will begin by discussing the mathematics behind the ESFJ cognitive function, and we'll also explain some terminology that you might need to help visualize how this exercise might be done. But before we do that, let's examine a few questions from the essay you wrote previously (Chapter Four)! Remember - these are simply intended to be examples of what the answer is going to say, not actual answers you should give!

Three, one, two, one, two, one, two....
...And one, and two, and three, and one, and two, and three, and one, and two, and three, and one, and two...

What about?

A:

Here's the image you need

But that is clearly not the answer.

There are a couple different answers!

3 and a half
4 and a half
7 and
8

All of these are correct. Let's start with the last, which is what we were interested in: 
3 and a half

There are a few things to note:
- The reason for this is because 3, 4, 5, 8 is a perfect square.

2 is a quadratic

One of the things that you did incorrectly was:
- You're adding 1 as the fourth digit because it has to add up to 18.
- Because 2 is a quadratic numbers in the range [1, 3].

1 is a cube

Now let's attempt to figure out why this is 

1 is a cube

There's only one way to represent cubes and that's as a triangle. 

But that's a perfectly square.

3 = 2^3 = 4^2 = 32 = 4

That leaves just one possibility

4

Now with only 4 possibilities left, you'll have

4 and 1 = 2 and 3 = 1

The answer is: 4 and 1

4 or 1

If this was already clear:

This was clearly answered using the ESFJ Cognitive Function, the ESFJ Cognitive Function is a mathematical model which describes a person's ability to solve problems via ESFJ

The ESFJ is really useful because it shows how to find a solution to a particular problem - however, one who lacks this basic ability doesn't have many chances of succeeding.

The ESFJ is a mathematical model which describes a person's ability to solve problems through ESFJ. There are many different variants, like the one above:  

If the figure is divided into equal parts you will get 1,2,3,4,5

That is, the ESFJ is a recursive method. 
The solution is

The answer is a perfect square 3 and a half

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict mathematics on a graph, we will use cubes. Each cube's sides will be the lengths of the three sides of a standard cube. Notice that not all sides are the same length! This concept is commonly known as the "cube" - and we will use this term a lot throughout the text! Also, notice that every cube has a hole in one of its four faces (or four corners) that will correspond to any combination of the three sides.  In other words, let's say our cube is 1 2 3 4.
Now, first, let's take a look at a few concepts about a cube. First, it's worth remembering that dimensions are made up of just three numbers: x, y, and z: 1 2 3 4.  In other words, our one dimensional cubes have four sides of equal length, and we can always find a way to change those sides to make our cubes three dimensional. 

One of the most confusing parts of explaining the concept of a cube is the term "cube." The definition of this term is relatively straightforward: a cube is a cube composed of four sides and a hole in one of its four faces. We will describe other terms and concepts used in order to more easily learn what a cube is before we move onto specifics of cubes. 

Since there are various definitions for a cube, we will only consider the one that is most useful for physics.

If we take a simple 2D cube made out of a regular two-by-two checkerboard pattern, then we can easily identify its dimensions. 
Each side is equal in length to its own side times 2; this means that if we take a length of 1 then we get 1 by multiplying that side by 2. Similarly, if we take a length of 3 then we get 2/3.  Similarly, if we take a length of 4, then we get 4 times 3.

Now let's look at a 3D cube. This is similar to the 2D cube except that you can't just take any number of the three sides, but instead you need to make sure that your cube has at least one side that is of equal length to the others. So say we have a regular 3D square with sides of length L. Then we can say that our L-dimensional cube has side lengths 2 L X 5 L. Or in other words, we are taking the 5 × 5 × 2 Sides of our regular 5X5X2 Squarebound Cube and swapping the square to a regular 5X5X3D Squared Cube:
The next two terms we've been discussing this session are "intersection" and "face." Intersections represent a four-sided set of edges that are all attached to a common point.

A common approach to working with a cube might be by using two of its intersections - intersecting it with two other cubes and then calculating how many sides have to change to place the intersection of those two cubes next to a third face. This requires us to think about what our cube would look like if we added one or four new sides to meet a set of four others. Now, as stated earlier, our space-time universe is comprised of three and one dimensions - this means we'll need at least some new dimensions to make space for the intersection points of our cubes!

We can visualize this by following the edges on each side of our cube! For example, if we add more sides in each of our 4 faces to meet three more sides then we get the following: 
This is an important keyhole we need to study because we will need to place this intersection point next to a face using a number of new (3×4) dimensions. The easiest way to figure it out for us is to pick some number between 1 and the length of the side of the cube that we intersect with and then take those four new dimensions...any two different dimensions add up to the length of one of the sides, so we can do this:
Notice how we can either end up with this intersection area having exactly the same four dimensions as our cube (i.e., being 3×3 or 3×4) or instead having a subset of those dimensions that differs from the dimensions of our cube, like this:

When we are finished with all the math, it will be very clear that as long as we intersect the space times of these six intersecting areas, we get all possible combinations that we may have for a 6-Sided Cube that is intersecting with 3 other cubes.  That was the basic idea behind this term in the first place: "intersection".
Now let's look at our cube! In simple terms, we can do three maths: 

Calculate the length of each of the four sides of our cube, and record this as the side length number.  
Multiply each side length by its own side length, so that we calculate the total side-length of our cube.  
Take any three of those side-length numbers and change the length of a side of our cube to make that side intersect more two intersecting sides!

Finally, we just need to choose three of those sides and make sure their length meets the requirements of one of the two previously given conditions:

3 of those sides must have a length equal to:
  √2 L X 5 L (or 4 if 3×3 or

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this material, we will now choose to include graphs rather than tables. While there is a variety of graphs you can use for this purpose, we believe it would make the discussion even more dynamic if we included diagrams and pictures at the same time! We should point out that we have included more graphics than even our best textbook! This is a great way for students to learn about the concepts in this course and will help them visualize some of the concepts better than we could ever hope to. This information is necessary to fully understand how the concepts in this course relate to mathematics and science in general. For more on this please follow this link: Concepts
Let's start with some basics to better understand what we are doing.

At this point in my presentation, we are going to use graphs to represent mathematics in a more visual fashion, rather than writing about mathematically complicated equations and statements in books. In this particular discussion, we will only be discussing graph theory, which is relatively new but has the ability to represent complex mathematically-ambiguous statements as simple graphical illustrations.

To do this, we would like to focus on two basic concepts first...
First, we're going to make the notation a bit easier to read and understand. So instead of all the lines at the top of this paragraph, where it says "simple mathematical equation," let's change that to "simple graph." Likewise, "numerator," "denominator," "symbol," "formula, and "result" all change to "graph" to keep the notation a bit simpler and clearer to read.

Now let's bring this graph theory concept into the context of a real-life situation. Let's take a look at the following picture of a tree:

We would like to know how many leaves (horizontal lines) there are in this tree. This is a bit harder with a tree than with a graph - you would have to take a picture of the actual tree and then use a ruler to mark how many leaves there are. This doesn't have to be so complicated in reality: we can take a picture of the tree with little children sitting around it and use a ruler to make sure it truly has the correct size for the picture. Or we could check a dictionary and take a picture of it with all the appropriate details. In order to make this conversation a little more realistic, let's take a look at these two pictures as examples of pictures taken with different types of cameras...

Note that picture 1 uses a small camera that can only take a clear, sharp picture, whereas picture 2 uses a large camera that can take both a sharp and a dull picture. Both pictures show different types of plants - in picture 1 we could easily see the leaves of an evergreen tree, whereas the leaves in picture 2 are in the shade. These pictures are different, so we could easily understand that picture 2 is a shade of picture 1, whereas picture 1 isn't.

We can now describe our graph so that each leaf (horizontal line) has a label. This will be useful for us to refer back to later - for instance, to describe the leaves, or to define the symbols needed inside the graph itself. Let's take this picture of a tree in case it helps illustrate.
Picture 2 - picture taken with a small camera

Picture 1 - picture taken with a large camera

The next step is to describe each leaf using these simple symbols or formulas:

What we have here is the result of multiplying picture 1 with picture 2, which together gives us picture 2. Let's take a look at the equation for the formula:

These two formulas really tell us how to describe our graph! Now let's go over to the next step: drawing a picture! Let's start by drawing a small tree in the middle, with little trees around it!

Picture 2 - picture taken with a small camera

Picture 1 - picture taken with a large camera

Now let's go over to our tree graph! To do this, we would like to place every leaf on a horizontal line and then repeat these steps. This is our result (which we've labelled with the formula):

Now with each line, we could draw in a symbol or symbol and number, depending on what we need to refer to next - for instance, to see the number of leaves we would use the symbol n or N.
Now once we have all our symbols on our tree graph, we can put everything in order and create our actual tree!

Picture 2 - picture taken with a small camera

Picture 1 - picture taken with a large camera

The next thing we would do is draw a vertical line to start our tree! We could also do this outside of our graph, using a ruler to mark the beginning of the tree; however, this is more involved for a larger diagram!

Picture 3 - picture taken with a large camera

Picture 2 - picture taken with a small camera

This step has two important parts...we need to draw the number of plants in the diagram and also put the number of leaves in order.
The number of plants in the diagram is easy. We just need to measure the size of the diagram (or the area that each leaf has on it) and multiply it by the number of leaves in the diagram. So we'll use a ruler to do

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the complex structure of an enneagram, we can use topology to help us visualize both how the structure of a deity is organized and the way in which its attributes are expressed...the ultimate goal is to find out how all those different aspects all function together!

As we discussed in the previous chapter, it is possible to have four members of a given enneagram and yet they are not the same! To see that, consider a group of four deities and each of them comes with a different range of attributes - each being capable of having certain abilities and being unable to do certain things. As you can see by comparing the four deities on the left with their respective Topo Topo Pyramids drawn to scale, there are very clear signs that they are the same! If we compare the four deities on the right with their respective Topo Topo Pyramids - just like the example on the left but in reverse - we can see the same phenomenon happening!

If we look closely at the four main attributes on both deity Topo Topo Pyramids, you can see that each deity has four of these attributes...just like we did with individual attributes when comparing them with the Topo Topo Pyramids!

As you can see, each deity on the Pyramid has four sets of four different attributes which form a series! This is called Enneagram Topology, which is useful for teaching about different aspects of attributes that are shared across deities in a given enneagram. If we are not sure about the level of deity in our enneagram - we can look this up in our Topo Topo Pyramid - for an example of a Topo Topo Pyramid that can provide some helpful understanding, consider this one:

This image depicts the Topo Topo Pyramid of a deity at the first (Topo) level of their enneagram, where their main attributes and attributes that they are able to affect or control begin...you get the picture!

Now let's take a look at the Topo Topo Pyramid of a deity on a level slightly to the right of their enneagram - at the level of their second (Topo) level attribute - let's say there is less time available. At this point, their third (Topo) level attributes become more important to them - like time - and it becomes clear to which deity their second level attribute is best suited. The deities that would need their second level attributes the most are the deities on the second and third levels of their enneagram. For details on Topo Topo Pyramids and Deities, read our previous post entitled The Five Deities of the Enneagram!

You can see the deities are grouped together according to their level of attribute, which is like the people grouped together by age, profession, etc. So a deity of the first level of their enneagram would be most akin to their own age (18-20) while being most active (or the youngest member) of an enneagram...the second-level deities would be the members of the second age (30-40) or the youngest members of an enneagram...and so on...

Now you might notice that each deity on the Topo Topo Pyramid has a list of associated Topo Topo Pyramids. For example, our deity A has a list of eight associated Topo Topo Pyramids, including those pictured on the last three rows. Some attributes are unique to certain subsets of deities...for those who prefer to learn about these topics by doing research online, Amazon has a great resource called Topo Topo Pyramids Made Easy! In which they demonstrate how each Topo Topo Pyramid is used to express the attributes of a deity based on their respective attributes. For detailed study of this topic, read our previous post entitled The Topo Topo Pyramid of the Goddess Athena!...

To understand each deity's attributes better, we look at the Topo Topo Pyramids that they form based on their associated Topo Topo Pyramids. For example, you can see the Topo Topo Pyramid of our deity A at the upper right side of their associated Pyramid. In the example depicted, we see that their main attributes and attributes they are able to affect or control is time, and the list of the Topo Topo Pyramids that they form based on this attribute are:

Based on their Topo Topo Pyramids at the same level, we see that their level of attributes they are able to affect or control are their skills and professions:

Based on these Topo Topo Pyramids at the same level, we can see that their level of attributes they are able to affect or control is their skill in maths:

Based on these Topo Topo Pyramids at the same level, we can see that their level of attributes they are able to affect or control are time and relationships with other people:

All of these Topo Topo Pyramids can be used

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict our thoughts and feelings, we can use symbolic language. Instead of words, let's use an image! Using a color-coded dictionary, you can quickly organize your thoughts visually. I use this coloring book throughout my own work. In other words, it not only helps me organize my thinking, but it's also a lovely way to convey your own unique personalities!

In traditional thought, we have created a huge collection of words that make up language and communicate our emotions - but to learn these words we need to learn all of them by heart, and it's not always fun! Let's have a look at a few examples of different kinds of color-coded dictionaries!

In black, I list the main terms that are relevant to my work and life, and then draw a circle for each term. The center circle is the term my mind has the most clarity on, and circles out to the sides contain words whose meanings I understand a little better but not what I'm currently working on.

Using circles with the same color as the term is called holophony, and is a good technique used in hypnotherapy to help make your mental images come out the way they actually are. It also works great when working on different areas of an idea.

To help with writing my own term, I use a color-coding system that organizes the different areas of my life as we speak - a sort of a hypertext file that I'm using all the time! Using a color-coding system allows me to identify my various areas of focus and clearly define my writing goals. This also helps me stay focused on one place while avoiding distraction, and at the same time allows my mind to flow freely among my various topics without any overwhelm.

It's easy to understand why we use color-coding systems in our daily lives - it's so much easier to remember the color name of a thing that we know the shape. A dictionary is one example of an object that is usually colored, but I am not sure if that is the only one. I'll have to come back to this topic in the future - I just love organizing and categorizing things in such a way!

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the real challenge for us as mathematicians is to understand what the correct underlying theory is in physics. If we want to understand how our lives may be affected by physics, we will need to understand what is causing space-time to curve, how particles actually behave, and what exactly physics is - how it relates to mathematics.

As with any other subject, there are many different definitions of what the correct underlying theory is in physics. Unfortunately, while most mathematicians are used to thinking of the true underlying theory in terms of mathematically beautiful mathematical equations, we have not necessarily been taught to think of physics in the same language. To understand how the true underlying theory of physics is, we need to study the mathematical equations that describe the behavior and motion of particles as well as their interactions with other particles.

So, rather than go into too much detail, we will only touch a tiny bit on theories of this nature...and we will mainly give an overview of topology theory rather than math! This section isn't particularly dense of technical math. But it will still help us understand how to use topology to describe the world!

As is typical in physics, space and time are intertwined - they both make up a 4D fabric called spacetime. And just as objects in our 3D universe are affected by forces, objects in 4D spacetime are affected by something called curvature. This curvature is caused by the presence of mass and energy - the more mass and energy there is in a given region of spacetime, the more curved it will be...

Since there are different kinds of spaces (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D,...) it is possible to have different kinds of space-time curvature. Also, there are specific kinds of spaces (e.g. a 3+1 dimensional space would have the lowest curvature) and certain kinds of space-time curvature (e.g. a non-conformal space-time would be the highest curvature). Of course, space-time contains curved components; but we don't really need all the curved space-time - there is plenty of non-coexistent space in nature that is just space...just like there is plenty of space that is just time...

Now let's use our previously described example of our hypothetical particle entering into Dimension X through a door to illustrate how this affects the particle's motion in spacetime...we will keep this simple and abstract and stick with our 4D particle!

Imagine that we move our 4D particle up a spiral staircase, one step at a time. At any given moment, we would be measuring its absolute position along the spiral staircase, which we will refer to as u0. However, at the end of the spiral staircase, we have a new measurement of its absolute position, known as v0. v0 is a measurement of how quickly the particle has traveled from u0 to v0, and it is a measurement of its relative speed with respect to the rest of the 5D manifold:

Where as the previous measurements were all relative to the rest of the 5D manifold, v0 is a measurement of how quickly the particle has traversed from the last measurement, v0, back to u0. And v0 is a measure of how far its path has traveled, v0:

So to understand how this 4D particle travels from one measurement, u0, to another measurement, v0, we can use the equations below...

Obviously this is a 4D particle in spacetime, so we need to use equations and variables from this 4D universe. We also need to scale the two values to the proper magnitude in our 3+1 dimensional universe, because our particle is a 4D particle...so we need to make sure that the correct dimensionally correct quantities are being used.

Let's first consider the relative speed:

And the distance traveled:

Of course, both of these are relative to our particular measure of velocity:

Now that we know the relative speed and distance between u0 and v0, we can simply use the relative velocity to express the path length traveled along the spiral staircase.

(But of course, the relative velocity won't be correct if one of the initial measurements (u0) is outside the 5D space...unless u0 were a true, but hypothetical, position in Dimension X...whereas our actual position is u0.)

Now let's consider the absolute motion of the particle. At the beginning of the spiral staircase, u0 was a 1-dimensional location which caused a gravitational force to cause u0 to move upward. And now u0 has a gravitational acceleration g, so v0 increases as g = v0/u0! The path traveled by the particle along the spiral staircase will be exactly the same if one of its initial measurements, u0, is at a proper null time. All that happened is that the relative speed between u0 and v0 increased! And once the particle made a successful exit from Dimension X, it had the same absolute motion as it would have in an environment with no curvature, g= 0! Its speed was just relative to its own acceleration.

However, if the initial measurement was out of the world of the 5D manifold, then the equation for v0 will not apply, and

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the world we reside in, we can have a look at how our brains map a very simple picture. A picture is the representation of a thing in our mind. Like we would say that a tree is the picture that our brains create of it, a picture is the representation of a world and we can use it to understand and navigate the world we live in.
As you read through the contents of this chapter, you will get to see that there are six main areas in our brains whose function is to map a picture in our minds onto other parts of our brain. Each of these six areas contains a corresponding color, so you see that in order for a picture to be perceived correctly, the brain must map the colors on the picture onto those color areas in the other parts of the brain.

So first thing we will be doing in this section is to see the main six color areas in our brain - the areas that correspond to which color we see on a picture.  You'll want to keep in mind that unlike most mammals, we don't really use color on a purely aesthetic level. It's just because we see colors because they are the colors of things people are going to paint their faces in our society. In other words, as you read this chapter, you'll be able to see that different colors correspond to different types of things - and these colors can correspond to things that are visually very distinct such as white and black, red and blue, or even purple and pink.

Let's take a moment and think about a simple 3-D box on the ground that is colored blue. Think about what happens when a blue object enters 3-D space-time, right off the bat - for those who don't know, we're talking about a black object that's spinning around on its own axis. So when we think of a black object in 3-D space-time, it is being pushed around as its own axis is spinning around it.

Now imagine that the same black object enters a 2D plane; the surface of the 2D space-time would suddenly be darker - and you would expect this to look a bit strange because there was no such thing as a color before. However, as mentioned in last chapter, we are constantly using color to represent the colors of things in our society. You may not know this, but we perceive color on an aesthetic level - not only does it help make things more visually distinct, but it also helps us classify different things, like green, blue, yellow, orange, brown and purple are all on an aesthetic level used for aesthetically pleasing colors.

So how do we differentiate colors? Well, the first thing to notice is that colors tend to have patterns - like black is usually flat and orange is usually round. So for all the same color, having the same pattern is good - while for different colors, having different patterns is much better. So here's a simple example of different colors that could be recognized:

Now remember that color is part of our mind, so if you want to make your picture distinguishable, then you want to make your picture have different patterns.  So when we say different patterns, we mean different colors within the same pattern.

So, next, let's take a minute to see the first brain area that our brains use when they create a picture. First we need to understand that picture area - the area of the brain where colors are represented - called the ventral part of the occipital lobe.

The area of the brain that gets activated when we see colors is the area that is known as the ventral part of the occipital lobe. This is basically the area in there that is activated when we see colors! As we saw in last chapter, a picture corresponds to an image in our minds, so because of this image, there is one area of the brain that gets activated when we see colors - this area is known as the ventral part of the occipital lobe.

So this means that the ventral part of the occipital lobe will not be activated if there are certain colors that we know are not the best fits for a particular color - those colors are going to get mapped into the ventral part of the occipital lobe.

Remember that we can't have just a single pattern of colors within the same color; if we only have three or four colors,

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how the mind might work as we get to the highest possible levels in the hierarchy of the mind, we will take a closer look at how mathematics functions in our minds.

We need to first define a little terminology regarding mind functions. The term "mental functions" refers to processes that can be performed using either direct neural inputs (connections to the outside world) or indirect neural inputs. That is, in some cases our brains directly communicate with external objects through other parts of the mind. In these cases we speak of "kinesthetic functions of the mind". For example, perceiving visual information or hearing sound information would all fulfill this description. Other mental functions, like imagining a given idea, creating a fictitious image, or thinking about a particular task, could also be classified as mental functions. Furthermore, although most mental functions are purely perceptual, they do include some kind of cognition (thinking: "how", "what", "why"). Most mental functions have been successfully explained using our brains' "visual" abilities. This section will therefore focus on how these visual functions might be explained using mathematics!

The Mental Process

One of the key factors that differentiate human beings from all other animals is the degree of ability we have to think thoughtfully. This ability is often called "cognition"! We also frequently call our ability to think thoughtfully "cognitive functions".

This ability enables us to make complex judgments and evaluate abstract information. For instance, in the case of complex questions, the answer to a question depends on how many different things people can think about the same question. These mental processes involve complex patterns of connections between both brain areas called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and parietal lobes.

This complex brain process may seem simple enough, but it has an impressive array of implications for our brains. This array of implications lies in the fact that this complex mPFC-mPFC-mTDLPFC brain network is connected to several other parts of the brain, giving people the ability to apply their cognitive biases to a specific problem. Thus, some people might use a biased approach to a problem - they might be more observant or aware in particular areas of the brain that contribute to solving the problem. Others might instead use a disassociated approach, or they might ignore areas that contribute to answering the problem.

These biases, or mental processes, all function together to provide a high degree of cognitive flexibility! As a result, when people are given problems they can think about, they are more likely to find answers to the problem that use a biased or disassociated approach, and may find answers to the problem that can be used to solve that problem in other ways.

But why do we need this? Of course, the reason we need this is that the way we learn, the way we reason, the way we think - all these processes are built around how we use our brains' "visual" abilities. This view of thinking makes perfect sense: we can learn faster and make logical, deductions about our environment based on our visual abilities. This ability to reason and think independently (but based on our "visual" abilities) allows us to make decisions based on our brain's ability to reason. Consequently, our experience in the world shapes our mental processes, giving us an advantage over animals in the world!

So how does our ability to reason and think influence our ability to learn math?

Visual representations of math concepts help us represent math concepts as symbols. These tools provide a way to represent math concepts so that we can reason about the concepts we are not able to represent analytically. It is this ability to reason about math concepts that lets us learn math effectively. In addition, we also understand mathematics from the perspective of an abstract concept - we can't easily reason about concrete examples, such as numbers or geometrical figures.

The Mental Structure

Our ability to think thoughtlessly, which means our ability to use our mental processes to reason about math concepts and apply biases to those concepts, creates a unique mental structure for each person. Within that mental structure there are some concepts that the person already understands, such as the basic idea that each area of the brain contributes to a certain mental function. Furthermore, there are some concepts that people might not know yet, so that they need to use other brain areas to figure out how to answer a question about an unknown concept. These other brain functions include memory, executive functions, etc.

Therefore, the number/number equation that defines which areas of the brain play which functions is something that we know, and something that is defined by the numbers and functions that we use to represent and reason about these concepts.

The Mental Activity of Math

In the last part of this section we will explore how our ability to reason about math concepts is used to produce and understand the mental activity of mathematics. We call this mental activity "mental actions."

The mental action that most people experience when they learn math is called mental transformation! This mental transformation begins at the very beginning, when math children are learning to distinguish between 0 and 1. Because they are learning to do so from relatively simple things such as counting, they begin to know many different types

To better depict the concept of cognitive function in mathematics, let's take a look at John's famous brain model. The brain comprises three basic parts:

OFC - the prefrontal lobe where decisions are made;
IPL - the anterior cingulate cortex - the part responsible for emotion and affect; and
PCG - the parietal lobe consisting of many specialized regions dedicated to cognition in general.

Let's look at each of these three regions in more detail. Below we show the three brain regions labeled as OFC, IPL, and PCH (for Prefrontal Cortex), so you'll have a better idea of what these important parts of the brain are.

The prefrontal lobe - the regions that makes people aware of their actions and goals and has a large role in our higher-level processing as well as our higher-level memory.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - the part of the brain responsible for emotions and mood, such as anger, disgust, sadness, anger, etc. Often called the emotion center, this important region is also important for our long-term memory.
The parietal lobe - the region in our body responsible for spatial recognition, such as the ability to follow a blue arrow!

Now take a look at what these parts of the brain represent in mathematics:

The OFC - the prefrontal region. This part of the brain is one of our most important parts for reasoning and problem-solving, as we use it to calculate possible results for any given situation. This part of the brain is also used as the main route to emotion, and as such, some mathematical reasoning or calculation may require this region to be activated.

The IPL - the anterior cingulate cortex. This area is responsible for emotions, and is heavily involved in memory, but it is also useful for long-term memories and long-term thinking.

The PCH - the parietal lobe. This is where spatial concepts and the ability to recognize your body is held.

We now know more about each of the three regions of the brain that make us think and learn mathematically. It is worth noting that each of these parts of the brain, and the way that they are involved in mathematics, vary considerably depending on the type of person you are a mathematician. Here's a summary of what the three parts of the brain are used for and the various mathematical reasoning involved when solving problems.

A more detailed look at the part of your brain responsible for mathematics and math-related reasoning can be found here, which may prove useful in learning more about all three parts of the brain.

But how do you actually use mathematics? Well to answer this question we'll have to look at how mathematicians communicate and why. In other words, we will need to get a much clearer picture of how mathematicians think, how they learn, and what type of mathematical reasoning do they do when solving problems.

The way mathematicians think is by looking at mathematical problems that they have come across. Usually they start by asking themselves:

What is a function? A function is a mathematical description of something. For example, if I were to ask myself: "What is the shape of a pyramid?", I would look at a pyramid and ask, "What is its shape?"

Then they look at the values associated with each variable involved and determine the mathematical function that best fit the variable values. This process typically involves some sort of mathematical proof (in mathematical terminology, 'proofing'), which is why it is often referred to as an 'algebraical proof'. At this stage, they would start writing down some sorts of mathematical formulas to represent the results of their reasoning.

But to actually learn how to solve mathematical problems, mathematicians typically work backwards from the solution itself. Instead of solving the problem starting from scratch, they often start by determining some sort of problem 'downstream' from the actual problem being solved - as an example: What is a function? The function that would best describe the shape of a pyramid would then be used to determine how to calculate its coordinates and how to solve a similar question related to its height.

Then from here they go a little bit further, such as writing down some partial differential equations. If you look at a differential equation and see the expression f(x) - g(x) = 0, and you are given the functions f(x) and g(x) as examples, you can use this equation in conjunction with other equations that give f(x) or g(x) values in order to determine the solution f(x) - g(x) = 0. Using this process they often make use of derivatives of f(x) and or of g(x), or other ways of dealing with the expression f(x) - g(x) = 0 for mathematical purposes.

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how complex things can be when we look at them in terms of other objects, we may use the metaphor of a brain: an enormous multi-dimensional computer (known as a brain) that is connected to multiple input-output connections (the "skull"). Mathematically, this brain is represented in terms of two major entities, vectors and matrices. Each vector has its own number of nodes that define its component numbers, and each node, along with its associated number of input values, defines its corresponding component number in a matrix. The outputs from one node are the inputs to the next node - this is a highly sophisticated mathematical model that makes it possible for a brain to make complicated calculations!

Let us take a look at the brain and some simple everyday objects, such as a pencil, book, or a pencil sharpener. Each of these objects has its main uses associated with it: a pencil sharpener is used to sharpen a pencil, while a book is used for holding and reading a wide variety of material (often including papers, textbooks, and magazines); and a book is a simple container that can hold a variety of materials such as paper, spices, food, or even a pencil!

Now let's use these examples to understand the mathematical model of the brain. Let's take an individual whose body is made entirely of energy - this individual is known as a mathematically intelligent individual. As shown, he can make arbitrary calculations even though his brain is only a multi-dimensional computer! The main components of this brain - the brain's vectors and matrices - come in a range of different colors! Each component of the brain is defined by a different color: red, pink, blue, green, blue-green, purple, yellow-red, yellow-purple, orange-red, purple-orange, orange-purple, etc. The color of each component defines the type of mathematical process it can perform: for example, red vectors perform arithmetic math, while blue-vector algorithms are able to perform logic math, etc... 

Let's take the above example again, but make it into something more complicated. Let's say that we have an individual that can control a spacecraft that will take him to various planets in the universe. We'll call this spacecraft a spacecraft! This spacecraft has one input that is going to control the direction that the individual travels, while his other input is going to specify the speed of the spacecraft. If this individual decides his speed is going to be too fast, he can choose to have his body experience a large acceleration (due to the fact that his body and mind work towards optimizing his speed); and if he decides his speed is going to be too slow, there's a chance that his body will experience a small acceleration (since speed will decrease as your brain tries to calculate your future course of action).

Now let's consider an individual with a similar brain and spacecraft. While this individual is exploring planets, he is controlling his spacecraft so that the spacecraft can take him to those planets. When we see this individual do this, we find that he does the same math that the first person had to do before - he simply selects his speed and direction. The only difference is that the spacecraft now operates in a higher-dimensional plane; instead of going directly from one planet to another, instead he has to go through several intermediate planes. In other words, when he controls his spacecraft in these higher-dimensional planes, the spacecraft takes him to several different planets in his own native dimension (where his mind is) rather than one.!

One important thing to note about the model of the human brain and spacecraft is that the brain can do so as long as the spacecraft makes it through every single planet before the spacecraft enters a new destination. This means that if the person were to die, they could have continued their exploration of these planets without stopping. While it is not impossible to die while exploring the universe, it is definitely not advisable. 

In conclusion, if you have a higher dimensional mind, you may be able to explore these planets in lower dimensions without too much of an issue! This makes sense as higher dimensional matter has the ability to move through lower dimensions - even if it does so under a number of conditions, it can do so without any issues! This has two important implications. 

First of all, if you are the type of mind that can move through an enormous mass of space (as shown above), then you may need not worry about dying in space. That being said, when you die in space, you need to do some type of preparation as a way of escaping into other dimensions and/or time (you don't have to die in this dimension, but you'll also need to be transported through it)

Second of all, if the mind you've developed is able to move through other higher-dimensional planes, you will be able to continue to explore the universe as long as you keep it under a healthy enough form. It is also interesting to note when you look at this in a different light, you might see why it's important for higher-dimensional matter to work within the constraints that are placed on it - the fact that a higher-dimensional mind is able to move freely within lower dimensional space is a huge step towards understanding how higher-dimensional matter works at a large scale; in order for it to do this

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how we see reality using our own inner senses, mathematicians have created the Intuitive Number System. This system uses numerical codes that mimic our everyday language to accurately represent numbers. One of these codes is known as the Number Nine (Nine). The meaning of the code is that "nine is the sum of two." So an eleven represents the sum of two, a five represents the sum of three, and so on...

To understand how these codes operate, let’s look at two examples:

Let's assume we have a room full of objects, some falling down to the floor and some standing there as they are. How many of these objects are standing? Or what does it mean when it states that three is the sum of two? Let's use the Number Nine symbol to represent each of these objects. Let's also assume we are asked to calculate the number of objects standing inside the room - it will be a number of twelve...and that is the answer!

Let's repeat the example in two more ways. This time we'll start out with just one of the objects, a plate at the floor. Then we'll remove that object and move it forward. The plate is now moving toward the door, which is an object that is also standing. The plate will begin to make a total of five objects. One of those objects - the door - is now moving with the plate, and the plate is now moving to the sum of two. So six is the sum of two. The floor has now made three objects at the center of the room.
Now let's consider the plate again. Let's assume that we are at the doorstep and want to know where this plate is relative to things on the ground. This way we can place it in some sort of order and quickly determine which of the plates is the one with the smaller sum of two. Let's say we are at the table and want to know the number of plates on the table. Let's also move the plate to the door and ask if the plate is still moving? If the plate is still moving, this plate is probably right next to the door. If not, the plate is probably in some sort of queue with the door.

Now let's consider the fourth example - let's assume we are walking through the room and want to know the number of items that are inside the room. To help us figure this out, we'll use the number of plates as a basis and move the plates forward. The table will continue to make two plates at the time. Then three plates will follow one by one. At this point it looks like the table is empty, but we can only assume that the plate is still moving forward. We can then remove the plate from the table and move it to the sum of two. We will now find our answer - twenty-four!

Let's now see how the Number Nine works using the examples we just created. Let's take a moment to understand how the Number Nine is a code...the numerical codes that describe our inner senses. Let's say we have a plate ("1") that is standing up to the bottom. Let's remove that plate and leave it standing all alone in the house. Our senses still tell us that the plate is standing - we still know that there are five objects in it! Now let's remove the other two plates ("5") and move them to the upper part of the house. The plate that was removed is now no longer standing but still has five objects in it! Now this plate is now moving to the sum of two, but we know it isn't moving the way we think it is. The number of objects that are moving in the house has now dropped to two.

So let's consider another way of thinking about Number Nine! Let's take a look at the three example objects in this chapter - the plate, the door, and the sum of two! When we remove the plate from the floor and remove a piece of the door, there are three objects in the house! We then add the sum of two at the top of the house. Now imagine that we remove two other objects at the top of the house. We now see only one object in the house! Since the object we removed from the floor has dropped to a single object, there aren't any more objects in the house! This means that the sum of two number is now now the sum of two and we have a total of two in the house!

In our last example, we removed a plate with a sum of two; let's remove the other two! And then we see that there are no more objects in the house! If we now remove a piece of the door, there are two objects in our house! We now have a total of two objects in that house! How could the sum of two number be even one more number? But wait a minute...we also have two plates standing on the ground! What could have happened?

So, the answer to this problem is that when we remove an object, there is no longer only one other object standing behind it! Rather, there are now two objects standing behind the original object! Which means that the total number of objects in the house has dropped by 2! The sum of two number, however, stays the same.

Now let's come back to the

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the differences between different types of Cognitive Functions, I'll begin by discussing each type of Cognitive Function separately.
The Basic Cognitive Function is a single cognitive process: Thinking / Reasoning / Listening / Memorizing / Understanding / Understanding Information / Analyzing / Reasoning / Critical Thinking.
The Basic Function is often depicted in a circle, and the process it is supposed to reflect (Thinking / Reasoning / Listening / Memorizing / Understanding / Understanding Information / Analyzing / Reasoning / Critical Thinking) is typically labeled as thinking. The process it isn't supposed to reflect (e.g. learning) is typically labeled as non-mathematical cognition. We can also categorize non-mathematical cognition into higher order cognition and lower order cognition. HOC is the higher order cognition that functions like a higher level thinking process, while LOC is the lower order cognition that makes up all the smaller higher order thinking processes that are in the brain. These higher degree process are usually mapped to one of four quadrants in a graph; the higher degree is the area that the higher order cognition fits inside of - the smaller higher order processes are in the outside quadrant. There are also four quadrants in the lower order cognition - they are labeled as higher, middle, lower, and free (i.e. they represent the individual's underlying cognitive abilities that cause the process not to be reflected in the circle). These four quadrants are mapped to two of the four cognitive functions mentioned previously, namely the Basic Function and Higher Order Cognition.
On the bottom left corner of the graph above is the Basic Function, which is sometimes called the thinking process. It is often depicted as a box with a circle inside of it. The circle includes the process of thinking, as well as any aspects of thinking other than thinking - such as thinking about the consequences of something you are doing.
The bottom right corner of the graph above is the Higher Order Cognition. It is also sometimes called the "thinking process" or "working memory." It is usually depicted as a point with a circle inside of it. The circle includes the process of thinking, as well as any aspects of thinking other than thinking - other than thinking about the consequences of something you are doing.
All 4 quadrants are in the brain, except the lower order cognition. The lower order cognition is outside the brain, but has much to do with the human mind, its cognitive processes, and other higher order cognition. It's what makes up higher order cognition. This part of the brain is responsible for critical thinking, reasoning, memory, understanding, and understanding information. The lower order cognition also plays a role in abstract thinking and scientific thinking.
The bottom-left quadrant of the graph above is the lower order cognition. It is often presented here as a rectangle with a square inside of it. This quadrant includes all of the smaller types of higher order cognition found in all four of the other quadrants (e.g. abstract, theoretical, and critical thinking). These lower order cognition functions as the basis for higher order cognition, so they're often depicted as a rectangle with a square inside of it. This quadrant includes the lower order cognition that makes up the working memory, which is shown here as a point with a circle inside of it.
The bottom-right quadrant of the graph above is the free (i.e. lower order) cognition. This quadrant includes some of the highest degree functions - the free (i.e. lower order) cognition includes thinking, and it should be noted that thinking is a higher order cognition. There is only one quadrant of free cognition in the brain, and that is the left side of the graph. It is composed of a higher order of cognition that cannot be described by Newton's laws alone, but it is still useful for understanding the behavior of lower order cognition.
To summarize, this is the basic graph for understanding the different Cognitive Functions. In this graph, thinking is depicted as a circle, and the higher order cognition functioned like a rectangle with a square inside of it. The lower order cognition functioned like a rectangle with a circle inside of it. All four of the Cognitive Quadrants are found in the brain, except for the free cognition, which is found on the opposite side of the right quadrant.
To continue along this topic, we will review some of the different mathematical functions that are used in math to describe the behavior of the different Cognitive
Functions. As with the basic graph, these are often depicted using the same basic circular shapes, and the basic mathematical functions that are used in math to describe the behavior of these functions are often represented with the same basic circles.

Basic Functions
Basic Functions are a set of mathematical functions that describe the behavior of the different cognitive functions. They are usually described using mathematical equations, but not always. We'll cover the basics that most people assume in our current understanding when making calculations, although there are a few exceptions to this rule.

To better depict how mathematics and physics are connected, we have put ourselves in the position of an entity that can travel through and enter into four different dimensions simultaneously. And although these are all possible behaviors the same way an entity in a 3D (or even a 4D universe) can enter into another dimension, they are all quite different!

Now before we have a closer look at mathematically related concepts like isospin, spin, and isospin multiplicity, let's do some quick background about the topic we'll be discussing today: Isospin. I hope that this will be an easy introduction to this topic - it won't be a deep dive in mathematics, but rather you will get a glimpse of what's going on without having to study much. I'll also try to cover the more abstract concepts as well...

Let's begin by trying to figure out what it's like to have four different kinds of particles traveling in the same direction. The most obvious way to do that is using isospin. Isospin is a spin-3 vector, and like everything else in physics, it's important to remember that the spin-3 vector has a vector sum of 1. Therefore, if we say a spin-3 particle has a total isospin of -4,  that means it has a 4 in each of its three components.

Now let's take a closer look at isospin. Isospin is a vector concept, which means it describes both particles and their interactions. In other words, isospin is the spin-3 particle's contribution to the total spin. And while it's possible to separate out different isospin components, there is actually a reason for doing so; this is because isospin is a 3+1 dimensional vector concept. So in other words, it describes both particle and interactions - including the way they interact.

Let's take a closer look at this. It's easier to take a look at how isospin behaves if we look at a 2D picture. In this picture, we can clearly see how isospin behaves by imagining a bunch of superpositioned particles, all going in the same direction. Let's say we want to study the behavior of the spin up, spin down, and spin down (the sum of all three) particles. Then all we need to do is separate these three pieces by using this mathematical concept - the isospin. 

Now, remembering how isospin works, let's try to find a similar concept that works in 1D instead of 2D. We'll call it isospin multiplicity, but to make it more clear, let's still use isospin to describe the different effects that are associated with each isospin component. Here's how isospin behaves in one:

Finally, if we want to show the more detailed description of isospin (which we will have to do in more detail later), let's try to illustrate it by taking a closer look at how a single unit of isospin behaves as it traverses the three dimensions. Let's do this:

Here's what happens as we go through the three isospin components and turn off spacial direction:

As we can see, the isospin component that is going in the same direction as the spatial direction is still spacial, and the isospin component that follows in different directions is also spacial. This is because it's still a 3+1 dimensional vector concept! And just as the isospin component that is going in the same direction as the spatial direction would be considered spin 3, it's impossible to distinguish spacial and isospin component that are traveling in two different directions because they're all spacial.

Now let's take a more detailed look at isospin. Remembering that isospin is a 3+1 dimensional vector concept, let's look at how it's described as a function of the three component isospin. Here's a graph that shows the relationship between the isospin components and their corresponding spacial component:

And remember what the spatial component does once it's gone: it becomes zero! And this is exactly what happens when we take isospin and sum them up:

Now let's take a more detailed look at all of this. In this graph, we can clearly see how isospin behaves by just considering the components' isospins separately, as opposed to looking at all of them combined and summing them up. I suspect you'll find this to be relatively easy to understand if you just look at this graph! And to show you how much easier it can be to understand, I'll use some example vectors in the mathematically oriented literature instead of illustrations that I haven't done (I should probably get them to come up with them for me!).

The most interesting thing about isospin is that it describes not only both spins and spin multiplicity, but also their interactions too. It's important to note that when we combine multiple spin-1 particles (such as spin-up, spin-down, or spin-0 particles), their interactions do not affect isospin in any way. And this makes it easy to make predictions about isospin based on interactions - for example, if we wanted to predict the behavior of particles in an unknown system, we'd have to consider the effects of interactions and their corresponding contributions to isospin!

So, as you can see, isospin is a 3+1 dimension vector concept that describes both particles and their inter-particle coupling, which makes it a powerful concept to study! I would strongly suggest

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how we understand and predict the behavior of particles in higher dimensions, let's take a brief look at our basic 3+1 dimensional world and figure out how we understand and predict the behavior of particles in it.

Imagine you are riding on the back of a horse. At some point, you jump out from behind the horse! How would you feel? This is the question we address in Chapter Twenty of this series. Imagine you're riding through a tunnel. If you were riding through a tunnel in 3+1 space, you would most likely just feel like you were flying across the tunnel. In fact that would be the way particle physicists describe what an event like this would feel like: energy is being transferred from one point to another in a process referred to as tunneling - this allows the particle to continue on its way because energy is being extracted by way of a tunneling process.

Next, imagine you can fly. How about if you could fly through space? Would that feel? This is essentially the same question we ask of deities. So imagine you are a flying entity in a 4D universe! How would that feel? If the tunneling process were taking place in our 4D space, then, of course, flying would feel a lot different.

Now imagine you can go from one dimension to another. What happens when you go from 3+1 dimension to another? If you get stuck, do you feel like you are falling to the bottom or something? What would you feel like if you got stuck in 2+2 dimension? How might this feel? How would it feel if you got stuck in 2+1 space? And so forth. Wouldn't the sensation change, really? Wouldn't the tunneling process still be occurring? You would begin to notice some differences that only tunneling in our more specialized 4D space-time would show.

As we continue to explore what happens when we enter higher dimensions, we have the opportunity to make predictions about particle behavior. This can be done quite simply if we understand how the physics work of the field of mathematics applies to the phenomena of higher dimensional space-time.

The reason we focus on mathematics first is that we have a few tools in our toolbox that are crucial to understanding how all of the phenomena of more specialized spaces and dimensions work. They include not only our concepts of multiplication and division but also many other concepts used in mathematics from analysis to topology... etc. From these tools, we can make many generalizations and understand the behavior of higher dimensional phenomena.

First, let's look at the behavior of particles in higher dimensions when they interact with each other. Imagine we have 2 particles - the 2+2 particle and the 2+2 particle. Then, imagine we have the more specialized 4+2 particles. Imagine you can move your 4+2 objects in to another 2+2 dimension without getting stuck (as shown in Figure 9-1). What happens to these new objects?

Imagine you are riding through a tunnel - the tunnel may be some sort of air ship, or maybe a tunnel we have built for transportation purposes. For now let us assume that you just happen to be riding through, and not anything else. Now imagine your 2+2 particle falls from 1+2 dimension to 3+2 dimension, and the new object 2+2 particle falls from 3+2 dimension to 2+2 dimension. How might this make your situation different? Would it affect the behavior of your more specialized 4+2 particles?

Again, imagine you are an entity in a 4D universe - this time we are talking about the 4+2 particle being in a 4-dimensional tunnel. Would you feel like you were flying through space? Would it feel different for you as the tunneling process continues?

Now imagine we have a 3+1 dimensional entity riding through a 4-dimensional tunnel. After your 3+1 dimensional entity falls from 1+1 dimension to 3+1 dimension, the 4+2 particle falls from 3+1 dimension to 2+1 dimension. Once again, let us assume that your more specialized particles don't get stuck on either side (although, let's let this be a simple thought experiment!)

Finally, suppose we are looking at a larger 3+1 dimensional tunnel of a specific type. Let's assume again, the tunnel itself is air-filled. Now imagine you are flying through the tunnel. The object in front of your 3+1 dimensional tunnel also falls from 1+1 to 3+1 dimension. Suppose it falls from 3+1 to 2+1 dimension, and the front object falls from 2+1 to +1 dimensional space (Figure 9-2). How does that affect your experience? Would you feel different? Would you notice any significant changes in the behavior of your 3+1 dimensional particles?

Now let's look at the behavior of particles travelling in different 3+1 dimensional universes.

Suppose we are currently in the 2+2 dimension of our more specialized 3+1 dimensional space-time - let us assume that our bodies are made of solid particles and are coated with a special surface. Now imagine that we suddenly pass through space between 2+2 and 3+1 dimensions while we are still riding on an airship. What would happen to the object between 2+2 and 3+1 dimensions? Would it be moving freely around in that 3+1 dimensional space-time, or even be stuck, like in the previously shown 2+2 particle example?

Now suppose we were moving into a 4-dimensional space-time

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it's about, we will start by explaining the process of ISTP. A common way to describe it is to say that ISTP is an umbrella term for everything related to mathematics with an emphasis on understanding, processing, and communicating information between people - just as we use mathematical formulas, algorithms, and equations to represent the "mathematical world" of objects, numbers (and numbers associated with numbers), and time and dates (and time and dates associated with time and dates)

In this chapter we will discuss this umbrella term and all of its components.

First, let's explore some of the mathematics that can be used to describe the process of ISTP. The first thing that comes to mind is the process of solving equations! We can use equations to model our understanding of many mathematical concepts (such as linear algebra) and to find out how to use algorithms to solve problems (such as solving a system of equations)

Let's take an example. What if we wanted to solve equation 7-8-2-3+4+4-6 for 6, that is, find how many 6s are in the numerator of 7-8-2?

We've probably seen this before - if you can find the answer, it's easy to give it a name: the process of solving an equation is an important part of understanding mathematics! 

In particular, if we solve equation 7-8-2-3+4+4-6 for 6, then we will get the answer: 4+4-6=24

Now what would happen if we wanted more information about the process of solving equations? Well, if we want more information, we will need to apply some form of mathematical reasoning - a process called reasoning! That explains how the steps to solving equations actually get going:

Figure 1 - Just like adding an 8 to a 6, we are creating a rational that has the right answer (note that this reasoning process is not directly related to mathematics)

This process is extremely important in understanding mathematics because it allows the information of one equation to be incorporated into another equation via calculations. So, for example, we can easily make the following:

Figure 2 - This is an example, but I guess our common understanding of the process of solving equations (adding an 8 to a 6) also applies to solving equations based on the sum of two other numbers, for example, 23-2!

Figure 3 - But now we won't just use our common understanding of solving equations (adding an 8 to a 6): we will actually be able to give a good equation for these numbers! Note that this is exactly what we see when we solve complex equations (such as the 4+4+6 equation above): we do a lot of algebra, and then simplify our results to get a good, or almost good, equation!

To wrap it up, we can say that the process of solving equations is used in all of mathematics (see Figure 4 and the text below it)! In our daily lives, we also often refer to equations as "mathematical formulas" just like we use formulas when analyzing and computing numbers or numbers associated with numbers.

The third piece of mathematics that we will discuss the importance of in understanding the way in which computers process information consists of information systems and computing! This concept is important because it allows computers to act on their input - or, in other words, process information - and then pass the information along to someone else to solve a problem. Information systems and computing can also be used in situations in which the answer is not known a priori - even if it is only a guess!

Now let's take an example! Imagine a young person at college trying to predict the height of a building. He or she can either use height charts of various buildings, or use a ruler and a measuring tape to measure something, but if they are too old, they might not understand how heights change with time! As an alternative, they could use the information systems and computing methods described in the previous chapter. These methods allow the prediction to be made by a computer without the need for a human to do anything else! Of course, the information systems and computing of the previous chapter involve some form of mathematical process - the process of knowing the answer to an equation and then using this equation with another equation.

Figure 4 - The importance of computer systems and computing in mathematics, and how they help people predict what's going on in other places!


Chapter Thirty Seven Introduction to Time
Now that we have a brief introduction to time, let's take a look at some of the important characteristics of time and compare them to features of our physical universe. You might wonder how can this be? Well there are more facts than we can mention here, and this may sound a bit complicated - but it's not the case!

First, let's explore what happens when a particle travels through space. This is the process of time travel, and if we were to take a slice through our universe at any given moment, we would see how our object moved within the 3+1 dimensional world. 

Figure 5 - The process of time travel, taking a slice through our universe

As you can see, we are very aware of the physical reality of the 3+1 dimension and how this world is related to our 2D space-time. However, unlike our 3-D world, our 2D world does not have a notion of time.

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the group's mission is to get everyone to leave without delay. However, they have been forced to wait longer than we had hoped for after taking one last look and hearing the announcements being made over and over again by the other characters. This is mainly because, having already been through so much, the heroes and heroines of this book had become increasingly bored with what had happened. On top of this, they had been spending more time thinking and relaxing away from the group instead of getting into their own personal worlds and adventures in them. And after being left in the dark about what that "restoration" would actually mean, the group started to lose patience.

It's the middle of the night. The time for the restoration has arrived and, as the group prepares to leave, one last moment is needed. The heroes and heroines must decide whether or not they are ready to continue their journey to what is left of their world. The majority of the characters have agreed to keep exploring - the most reluctant to give up their personal worlds! It's been a long time since the group last spent the night together, and the idea of going back into their own worlds seems daunting.

However, one of the girls, Rose, is already saying the last words. Even if they decide to stay, what exactly could the future hold for their lives? She must have some clue as to how all of this is far reaching and what exactly is happening.

So what do you think? Would you agree to go back into your own worlds, as the group prepares to leave? Or would you prefer to stay in one more day, instead? What would happen to Roseneal and Rose after the restorations go into effect? Would they be back together after what seems like so many years? Can you explain to us what the world of The Kingdom is like afterwards? Can you guess what happens to the other characters and why they are all gone? We're waiting to hear from you!

"Invited to leave the group" does not even imply that the group, as a whole, will be disbanded - it does not, for it does not express that a group as a whole will "exit forever". 

It does, however, make it appear that there is some future to The Kingdom...

(The other quote is from here, not specifically about this book)
The reason that this happened is because of the way in which The Kingdom was created - The Kingdom is an entirety (all people, not just the heroes and heroines, but everyone); this is not an individual thing, and therefore cannot be the cause of a "disbanded" group...

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the theory behind the popular computer systems you use is actually quite simple. It utilizes a number of personality dimensions, the MBTI, in order to describe how people function as computers, which is basically how people are thought to interact with those computers. In the past we have explored this concept quite extensively, and the theories behind the different personality scales are fairly simple in most instances.
However, there is a small detail when it comes to the psychological mechanisms behind the MBTI - and this detail is that the personality dimensions are not additive. In other words, for instance a 5D Personality type is completely different from 6D. Therefore a Personality A may be equally as powerful as Personality B. Furthermore, we don't know a priori which personality dimensions each computer perceives as most important either, because there is no way to have a direct measurement of personality dimensions. As such, we have had to depend on the computer scientists to come up with a measurement that tells us what type of computer should be installed and used as per each personality dimension.

In this chapter, I will discuss the various personality dimensions that were used by the developers of the MBTI in the late ’90s - namely six basic personality types as well as six major personality subtypes. Of course, I will also include information about the subtypes that were popular in the original MBTI and their success with computers. In the end, if you have any questions, I will have the section to the right for you to make your own educated guess!

Of course if you would like to explore this in more depth, you'll want to grab a copy of the book on your shelf! At the end of this chapter I am going to give you my assessment of the six basic personality types, as well as any changes to my recommendations they may become as a result of my research.

As a bonus, I will present how to get an accurate score on your MBTI using some free software. With this, I hope to give you a fair idea as to how your personality scores really compare within and between various demographic groups on the MBTI.

A:

The MBTI is a personality test, which is a relatively easy way to be able to get a pretty detailed profile of peoples' overall personality, even though they only cover a few personality dimensions.
One particular aspect of the personality test that I've had much trouble understanding is the three dimensional model.
You mention 

the three dimensional model is that most people understand and interpret information differently. For example, people can see a person as being the sum of the four dimensions but if they were to ask a person to describe themselves by using the same sentence, the person may use one of the dimensions to describe them and use the other to express their feelings or personality in relation to that dimension. 

But how this is actually possible? 
Let's see. Let us take the person who is describing themselves as having a 'high confidence' on a 4D Personality. They may not know that but they can have confidence in themselves as long as their confidence level is high enough. But when they see a person with a 'high fear' level on a 4D Personality, they may question this person's life's security due to the fear being high enough.
And then they can be uncertain of the reason behind the 'fear' even though it cannot be directly attributed to a dimension.
This is because, as long as you know the name from the description above of this person's personality, then you can be able to classify whether it is a high level or low level but no direct measurement can be done. And what I call a 3 dimensional model, that will tell you whether the person is describing themselves correctly.
One can see from this, how it is impossible to have direct measurements of the dimensions of the 2 and 3 dimensional models. And even if it is possible to get some sort of measure of a specific dimension but also of other ones, then this cannot be put into a one dimensional model.
For that very reason, I personally, feel that it would take a lot of work and effort to produce a comprehensive 3 dimensional model. And even with that, the 4D Personality and 6D Personality may not have such a comprehensive model as there may be.

A:

A brief summary, to clarify the concept:
The 5-D model was an attempt to account for the complexities of personality - i.e. the relationships between subtypes, and the relative importance of each.
However, this was a theoretical model & was based on the assumptions of a purely empirical technique: a very brief interview. The real reason for this is quite simple:
Even if we know something about a person, it cannot be measured directly.
So we have to derive data for each subfield. From this data we calculate a score, which represents a person's overall style.
We could then compare these scores against each other using a simple scale.
This is called cross-validation (or even calibration).
So the underlying idea is this:
If the method is not reliable enough - that is, it did not deliver enough data points, so we had to develop an alternative method.
If there were enough data, we could use it to infer other more complex traits.
If you have enough data, it's a

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict how the realities of daily life can be similar to the surreal world of dreams, you can check out this movie - Marriage On Baker Street, which is based on the true story of marriage between Thomas and Maria Baker. The film features characters such as Harry Houdini and Dorothy Gale, who both went through a similar experience as the couple depicted in the film.

Now let's imagine the situation where a real person is going through the process of having their wedding shot by a Hollywood star known as John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Obviously there will be some big problems that arise! To avoid this, Travolta and Newton-John decided to have a dream in which they become married...and not just because they both want to be with their love ones in the moment!

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the dynamics of the world, we would be better off writing in terms of the space-time fabric that we know - the 3+1 dimensional fabric spun out of a four dimensional spacetime. This fabric has three dimensions, time, and space. Let's pretend that we were just looking at a plane or a simple, straight line drawn in 3D space, and call it S. Let's take another plane, call it T, that is the same as S but with a little twist. Let's try and imagine that two objects at the same point on S end up on two different planes - in reality, it does not matter who you imagine - the point on the plane will change as you spin around the space the plane revolves around. It may even happen that two planes intersect, or a plane "flies" around the center of the other. If we follow one of these planes on the plane T for a while, we will get a picture so strange and detailed as to seem almost surreal even to us who live in our 3+1 dimensional world. If we keep spinning, we will end up looking at something else; let's call that L.

We should note that while this is more of an illustration than a full-fledged description of how reality works, it illustrates the dynamics of space and time very clearly. We can see the "lines" on S representing time and space - the curved lines represent the presence of mass and energy. Similarly, we can see a "flying car" on T representing the presence of energy - these planes are in fact 2 dimensional...if one car was riding on S and another car on T, they'd end up in opposing directions!

Now let's try to make a more concrete example in terms of ourselves and our body. Let's assume that we are sitting in a comfortable chair, and we're staring straight ahead, at a bright white screen. There is not much going on here except that we are staring straight ahead and sitting comfortably, so let's let it go without a second thought. We might as well take the screen itself as the object on which to sit, so our body would fit comfortably in our sitting position at the screen. However, when you turn your own body around when you begin to turn your mind into the position where we are staring straight ahead, your mind would look towards the wall at the screen. Or, in reverse, if your mind turns towards the wall on the screen, it would start looking down at your sitting position on the screen. The question we are asking is, which way would it look to a person sitting here? Either way would be the correct answer!

We should note that we can use the same diagram for the 3D world as well. When we talk about a plane, we are describing the space to which that plane points. When we talk about two planes - say S and T - we are describing the space to which they intersect. The same is true in the other dimensions as well: when you talk about the space to which a point is pointing, you are talking about the point itself; when you talk about two points - the point on one and the other - you are describing the areas where they intersect. Remember, we say that a point on S meets a point on T. It makes sense that you will meet the point on T in a horizontal line. Or, if you are standing on the wall on the screen, you will have to follow the line through one of the points to the other. If we assume that the two points are on the screen itself, we are describing the space where the two points intersect. Similarly, if we assume that S meets T in a vertical line, then we are describing the space where T intersects S. 

Now for a closer look at this scenario. Let's draw a line that goes straight up through the center of the screen. This is the plane on which you sit. To the left of this plane we will have walls on which we are standing. We look down to see if we can find anything that can be described as a line. Let's say that we can see this line that goes straight up from the screen: it is almost like a flat space between walls! We see that we can see this horizontal line for three reasons:

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the concept of micelia in mathematics, think of it as the equivalent of a thin section of fabric! These two dimensions are so similar that they can be connected to each other without breaking symmetry at all. Here is a quick way to make out how this works!

First let's consider a straight line from A to B, as shown here:

By connecting the two dots with the same angle (called the section line), we can quickly find out how much time has passed between the two locations.

Now let's think of a circle - a sphere - as the equivalent of a 2D micelia, but one with rotation around it's center. Here's what an example micelia looks like when taken from a 2D perspective:

As you can see, the center of the micelia has rotated 180 degrees around it's center. As time has passed along this micelia, this micelia has also rotated (up to an arbitrary constant amount) around the central axis of the sphere - henceforth called the time axis. If you are familiar with a rotating disk, you will quickly grasp the idea of how the rotation of a disk around itself is affected when it orbits another rotating disk! Also note that the distance that the time axis travels along the micelia at each time interval represents the distance travelled by the micelia in the time since the last time interval was taken. For example, if time travelled from A to B by a piece of a micelia is 60 seconds, then the time that elapsed between A and B was 60 seconds (60 seconds 60 seconds = 6.5 minutes!). This is a good way to visualize how a micelia can travel through time.

Note that if we want to connect micelia to one another, we'd need to connect two points on one micelia to two points on the other micelia. So once our time axis is established, we can connect two micelia together - in a very similar way as we attach two piececes:

However, let's now consider how we can tie together micelia of all shapes to form complete micelia! This is a tricky concept in geometry, but it turns out that this is possible!

So let's connect the two circles shown in the example (on the left-hand side). This will create a complete micelia, and we'll need two more points to attach to connect it in this case. Let's take another angle for the section line (which makes the point connecting the two circles appear a little bit more like a line of sight than a straight line!) and we have the following:

To connect this new circle in place of the first one, we need to make another angle for the section line (again, the line can become curvy in this example, but the point between the two circles will be quite similar to the position the two circles were before we connected them together). After connecting this circle in place of the first one, we have:

Now that we've completed our first complete micelia, we have created two more pairs of points that we need to connect together to form a micelia. If we are really careful, even after we connect a pair of these points, we can still leave one point behind if it's too far away from a point on the other micelia, but even then there is always room for one more pair! The end result is what we call a complete micelia - the result of adding all seven points in the previous step as a single point on the last pair. As time passes on the complete micelia, the micelia themselves remain the same, but the two points representing each pair of points connected together in the previous step begin to "twinkle" or rotate in different directions each time they make a turn.

Now let's look at the same picture in a 3D perspective - a point on the micelia is represented by a line that can be curved and straightened depending on what direction it's located in at the moment; the point at the end of a micelia's path is represented by a spherical object - the micelia itself is represented by the shape of the line connecting the point on the micelia to the point on the micelia's end! Now, as we can see, while the shape of the point representing the micelia is similar to a point on the complete micelia, we cannot

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the universe is made up of four dimensions, but for our purposes we'll focus on three spatial dimensions and one time dimension - what we experience in everyday life. In the rest of the story we will refer to these dimensions collectively as Dimension. To further explain what the terms "Dimension" actually mean, we'll use the following example:

The world is made up of three dimensionless spatial coordinates:

X: the position of a particle

Y: the direction of a particle

Z: the velocity of a particle

The time dimension is represented by the vector: t which gives us the magnitude and direction of that particle's velocity (how fast it is moving across the world, in terms of velocity of light).

From these three dimensionless coordinates we can construct a three dimensional vector:

And then we can write the expression for the mass of the particle:

And once we do this, we'll need more information to determine the type of mass we're working with. For now we'll assume that the particle is moving with constant spatial velocity and constant time - in other words, it is moving straight through its own path in space-time throughout the duration of the experiment.

We'll then use the expression for the velocity of light to calculate the magnitude of the mass of the particle:

Since Time always comes first when we're considering motion (for the purpose of physics), we'll take this expression for m and substitute it into our previous expression for m:

And now we're ready to calculate the mass of the particle, once again using the expression for the velocity of light:

And then we can write down the expression for the mass of the particle:

So far so good! We have a fairly good approximation to the mass of the particle - even with some uncertainties (i.e., approximations to velocity of light, not all of time are equal, etc.). In fact, since the particle is moving fast and constant over its path in space-time, the mass can be accurately calculated using the expression for the velocity of light - and a particle's shape is irrelevant as long as it stays inside our 3+1 dimensional universe! So it's safe to assume that the mass of the particle is the same as it's original mass.

Next, using the expression for the velocity of light:

And we can write down the expression for the velocity of the particle (assuming that it's a point mass):

So as you can see, the velocity of the particle is precisely equal to that of light - and that can only be true if particles' mass is equal to its original mass! This implies that the movement of the 4D particle is not affected by dimensions - it can go through both Dimension 0 and Dimension 1 and continue moving straight through Dimension 2 without experience any changes to its properties! This is not only true if the particles are moving through Dimension 0,1,2,3 as well (as we did above), but it also holds true for any other dimension.

Now that we have a good idea of the mass of the particle, let's figure out where it is located in space-time. We can calculate this location using the expression for the mass of the particle:

And after a bit of math:

Next, to work out the position of the particle, we need to remember that all three coordinates are intertwined together and represent a four dimensional fabric called space-time - not just three-dimensional space!

And we can represent spacetime in this familiar three dimensional form as follows:

So now we're ready to calculate the coordinate x, y, and z:

Since the particle moves in straight lines within Dimension 2, we just multiply each of these expressions by x and y and integrate:

Where:

We can now calculate the position of the particle by taking the x = 0 solution and integrating it over the three dimensional domain:

Which gives us:

So we're now ready to work out the velocity of the particle in Dimension 2 - that is, calculating its velocity by taking the x = 0 solution:

And we get:

For the x = 0 solution, note that the magnitude of the x component is equal to the x direction itself. And we can see that this is just the direction of the velocity - it's not the magnitude of the velocity. So while the direction of the velocity is in x, the magnitude of the velocity remains constant! That's actually what we expect to happen: the velocity of the particle always lies in the x direction. And it follows that the velocity of the particle in Dimension 2 is still the same as in Dimension 0 - and in fact always lies in the x direction!

So now we have a good idea of where the particle is located in space-time. By applying the three dimensional coordinate system, we know how far it is from the origin - the location of the particle in space.

And we know that it's already in Dimension 0 - and it's moving directly into Dimension 0. So we don't need to know any more information about how the particle is shaped to move forward into Dimension 1.
Now that we know that it is in Dimension 0, it makes sense to talk about it as a particle (though, as shown above, the term "Dimension" isn't really a word).

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the more we move into the realm of physics, the more strange and wondrous things start to become! This is one thing many people would not admit, however - when they first get introduced to physics, they tend to think about it from the perspective of its application to nature - as if physics is really all about nature itself, and the universe as a whole! Even though physicists love exploring different phenomena and discovering intriguing phenomena that are beyond our wildest imaginations, at the end of the day, there is always an issue with physics - whether or not physics can explain everything, whether or not it is the best way to handle life, etc. This is exactly why people prefer to keep their brains off of the problem for now - and focus on other things they like doing such as playing video games and creating awesome art!

Unfortunately, this is sometimes counterintuitive to many people - unless you are really good at physics, you would be totally out of touch with the topic of physics, and thus would not understand why people keep on denying that it isn't all about physics anymore! The fact is that there isn't a straight line between science and art, and it is important to keep that in mind when you are exploring different areas of physics!
For example, physics is a subject of inquiry where we try to understand what happens inside of our bodies and how it relates to the rest of the world - this is science! It's just that we're humans, not Gods, and sometimes we take science into our heads, and start to imagine everything we don't see, hear, or touch happening in physics! This tends to result in a lot of awesome artworks and inventions!

So what happens when we try to imagine that all we do is actually play with a rock, and that all we do is actually make use of our bodies and mind to make things happen instead of just creating things with our hands and feet!? Well at times, it can be fun, and I like experimenting with physics, but sometimes it just makes me feel kinda blah!

Let's take an example that is simple enough to understand - the atom! And I will start by going through the basics - what is the atom, and where does it come from? Let's do it from a different perspective: from a spiritual perspective.

Atoms are the smallest entities in the universe. They are comprised of tiny, indivisible atoms that are connected to each other via bonds or forces by their nuclei. Nuclei are protons and neutrons – the smallest particles in the atom.

We are trying to explain how and why atoms form. From the point of view of the atom, matter is a set of particles of energy. The energy of matter is described by the equation of state - the pressure of a fluid, for example, is a function of the density of the fluid as well as the temperature at which the fluid is being at - it measures the degree of energy that is being expended in bringing the fluid from one state to another - as long as the energy is not destroyed, the fluid remains unchanged! There are a number of physical phenomena that can be used to model this equation of state (with little, though, to no effort).
When pressure is applied to an object, new energy is expended in the process that generates the object, which in turn causes objects to stretch and contract. This process will continue until the energy is returned to the object completely. This is what we find when we try to measure the energy of things!

For example, try to place your hand on a hot pot of water! Once it is warmed up, the energy comes back to the pot, and so it creates a pressure on the pot, pulling the water out of the pot. The pot can then be used to create any object whatsoever! (You can also use a heat lamp to create an effect that resembles a fire!)

From this perspective, we can clearly see there is a fundamental difference between energy and matter! When a pot of water gets warm, it creates pressure in the water that pulls the water out of the pot, without destroying it! And when the pot is used to create objects, all of the energy it provides will be spent up until the pot is back in the same temperature or lower, and in that process, it destroys the pot. Which we see in the very first picture of your favorite hot tea - with the pot just sitting there waiting for the magic to happen. After the energy has been expended, the pot will become a pile of ashes!
That is not the only difference between energy and matter - and it is important to note that the two concepts are completely different; if you want to find out more about them, I strongly recommend you keep your brains on the side, as our brain is too lazy to keep on wondering "how" things work!!

Now let us look at a more practical example - the atom! Let's take it even further, to try and make the analogy from a spiritual perspective! Let's try and imagine that there is an invisible, mysterious force that can alter the properties of matter and destroy the matter itself! This force can be created by any form of medium - water, electricity, gravity, etc. - but it is

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict all of the elements of this chapter we must look at our previous understanding of dimension. We were supposed to remember that there are an infinite number of dimensions (see Chapter Thirteen). As is well known, some form of energy exists and can travel through any of these dimensions. This is referred to as space-time relativity and gives us a hint at what to expect as we discuss dimensions and their relationship to space-time and their interactions: objects can move through more than one dimension, and if their motions are consistent with the laws of physics at each of the dimensions they visit: we say it's valid physics at each dimension. Additionally, when we travel between dimensions, we can encounter strange happenings. As an example, imagine that we move from our current dimension to another with the same dimensionality but different curvature (like a higher dimensional plane). In this case, the trajectory of the particle is modified by the fact that it is traveling through space-time with higher curvature than the space-time we are familiar with. This implies that one of the laws at each dimensionality is broken - the laws of physics are no longer accurate and consistent...

What exactly do we learn from a more detailed understanding of space-time relativity?

After we have seen the importance of relativity in different dimensions, we'll look at how the laws of physics at each dimension are affected by it. This is very intuitive: while the law of gravitation at one dimension is more accurate that at another, it is only true for flat spacetime - any curved spacetime will violate this laws...and so on!

As you can see, this means we can use each of these laws at each of the dimensions we visit to predict how objects behave in any other potential dimension we visit and at different times - this helps explain how we get the current position of objects and also how we predict their future behavior.

The final, and most profound, element of this chapter is related to Deity Dimension Travel. This is something that has been discussed in other chapters. Basically, this means Deity Dimension Travel isn't entirely confined to real physical entities such as humans or the stars - it can also involve other unseen entities such as spirits or other deities that travel out of the physical world at a much higher speed and with less gravity than any real physical object could experience - this is what we've come up with for our Deity Dimension Travel concept!

But what exactly does this Deity Dimension Travel have to do with the laws of physics?! Well, this concept has several implications:

In the previous section and in all subsequent ones, we saw that if an object goes through a different dimensionality without experience any acceleration or a change of direction, then that means the laws of physics do not hold at that new dimensionality (they are not valid) and they are no longer valid at any higher dimensionality.
In other words, any object that is supposed to move through the 4D universe would experience acceleration when it is moved through the 3+1 dimensional universe too. In other words, such acceleration can't be caused by any real physical object traveling through our actual 3+1 dimensional universe!

And this means things would literally change drastically if we are to become aware of the fact that our own Deity Dimension is more than just just a dimension that we experience for the briefest of moments! When we consider the fact that deities also exist elsewhere in space and time, then suddenly the way that nature operates becomes very different than it is - all of these different dimensions would be affected by it. For example, imagine that we could be suddenly transported into another dimension! All of the laws of physics that govern motion would be completely gone and the way of things would change drastically!

There is one last piece of information you might want to know about this concept: in order to be able to use them correctly, all of them can only travel through their own native dimensionality. So if the dimensions to which an object could enter from within the physical world are all different from the dimensions to which it normally travels - as described in the previous section - that means the laws of physics at each of these spaces have already been altered. And while this is just speculation, it seems very possible that, during the lifetime of our Deity Dimension Travel system, some of the

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the relationship between the mind and physics, in this chapter we will start with what mathematical symbols represent - as opposed to what physical quantities like momentum and energy represent.  So instead of writing physics equations as symbols like a force X and a mass m squared, we'll write them as equations like the following:

$$F = m^{\dagger}\cdot \text{time}$$

Now let me provide a visual example: imagine there is a large, bright, and powerful lamp in front of you - its light shining down on and around you. You are a human being and your body is made from matter consisting of atoms. How will you feel when this huge lamp is turned off?  The answer is: as you would with light shining on a mirror - the amount of light reflected off your body is the same as if it were shining directly (i.e. if there is nothing between you and your body). So, we can compute the amount of light reflected from your body using the following:

$$\int_0^0 \sin^2 \theta dt$$

Now let's imagine your body is placed against a wall (called a wall of inertia) which surrounds your frame of reference. This is typically done to make things easier to understand; if we draw a plane that would intersect with your body, and then place a wall between your body and the plate, you see that it would always stay in this plane of symmetry (i.e. the plane that was parallel to the wall)! What if we instead drew a line that intersected with the body? Well, the plane which intersected with the body will be tilted (i.e. not perpendicular to the line you drew) and the plane perpendicular to the line will be tilted in the opposite direction! The same holds true with objects in spacetime: if we were to draw a line between our body and another object, the plane to which the line is parallel will always be tilted to the line as well! The reason the mirror and the lamp are tilted is because their bodies are made of matter which consists of a set of points called "atoms". These points move (rotate) through space as a wave - and therefore the plane that they are in intersects the wall and vice versa.
Now you can see that this is exactly how humans feel: we take in what we see and make the body move in the direction of what we see. And this is exactly how the body behaves at rest when everything else is kept static - the body will keep moving in the direction in which it is moving and vice versa, but in a way that keeps all other things moving in the same direction - and this is exactly what physics is trying to explain.

But what we are also interested in is what happens when someone turns on and off the lamp and the mirror. For example, is the reflected light exactly what we would expect? Well, since our lamp is moving faster and faster through spacetime, the reflected light will reflect off things closer to it than away from it. Let me give an example: imagine that we move through a very long tube filled with smoke. As we move toward the lamp and back to the lamp, the smoke will begin streaming along the walls as it moves through space - it will reflect back toward the lamp and then stop (it will stop as soon as it reaches the right distance from the lamp!). Now, the same thing happens in 4D spacetime though: if we place our body on a sheet of sheeted paper and then turn the paper on and off, the reflected smoke will reflect off the surface of the sheet in the direction in which it moves, and it will stop where it was before turning on! (Again, it reflects back to the sheet of paper because it is moving slower than the sheet!). Of course, the sheet of paper itself will behave the same - but only as the reflection of smoke and not its own substance! This is precisely what we would expect if we thought of the reflected light as a reflection of the body around it rather than as a reflection of the body itself! Let me give an example: imagine a group of people standing and the lamp is turned off - everyone sits down and rest! Then if the lamp is turned on again, we can again see these people sitting on the chairs and

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the power of illusion, let's start with a real-life tale of how a young magician was able to deceive a few of his own people, then turn the tables on his opponents by simply lying to them while doing so...just to fool them into believing that they were deceived!

Imagine having been tricked by someone else's lie. Would you believe them? This is where the ability to trick and play is so important in illusion, and that's where it's interesting to play both sides of the game...


At first glance the magician's skill isn't that great. He's simply lying and telling falsehoods about who and why he is! But that's the game! If people make the mistake of believing these lies, then they become prey to the illusion and may fall prey to their own lies when they've accepted the illusion!

There are many ways of playing both sides of the game in an illusion. Let's turn to what happens when a magician is forced to play both sides simultaneously.

In physics, there's an expression called superposition. Imagine this scenario: two objects move through a static medium - an infinitely thin wall. One of the objects (let's call it x) moves away from the wall at a constant speed v x. In a way, x and the wall come to be as one! But, of course, that's not the case! You can say that x gets a speed of v x + v x - the velocity due to x's acceleration and the constant amount of mass that is added to x's position - and it moves away from the wall at a speed v x - the difference between the velocity of x and the velocity of the wall (+ve x and -ve x respectively).

This example can be used to explain the superposition effect in an illusion. Imagine you are throwing a stone at a wall...how big the stone will be depends on the velocity of the stone at the time it hits the wall - v x is the velocity the stone is experiencing before it hits the wall. Let's say it hits a wall at velocity v x with initial speed of v x - v x. Then after it hits the wall, you can say the motion of the stone experienced after it hits the wall is v x - v x = v x x + (1 - v x )...

The result being that a stone hitting the wall with initial velocity v x - v x will be longer than a stone hitting the wall with initial speed v x + v x - v x. As in physics, this concept of illusion is also based on mass being added or subtracted from a particle's position during it's motion!

Now suppose we had a magician standing in front of a mirror and trying to impersonate someone with an identical facial features and expression as his target. He would try to make the person's facial features match his target's facial features and expression as closely as possible, but he can't, due to space-time limitations. This means that he would have to play both sides of the game, at the same time!

If a person had the same facial features but a different expression than his target, then there would be no illusion: no one would believe that they were trying to conceal their facial features from him! Similarly, if the person's facial features were identical, but they expressed a different type of emotion - sadness, anger, etc - the illusion would fall away. Let's say a magician manipulated his target with anger and then manipulated the opposite way - no one would be deceived in this scenario - they would all think the guy had really been angry!!!!

If, on the other hand, a person had a smile and an expression that matched his target's facial features and expression - no one would be deceived - it would just be another illusion! In this situation, you can say that everyone would be deceived! As such, magic is all illusion - there is always going to be some truth to it, but no one will believe that they are being deceived!

So here at the end of the day - all of which is the case during real life! Of course this does not mean that magician are all liars. There are plenty of actual magicians who do follow the rules of the game when

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the way life evolves in a magical world, I would like to introduce the concept of the "meadowmage." As you know, a "meadowmage" in a magical world is any person that lives outside of the actual confines of a magical world. For example, if you have a magical garden in one place, you could also have magical meadows in another one.
An important advantage of living on a "meadowmage island" is that you get many benefits from the island's green and lush habitats. Most notably, you get access to the natural resources of an island. These resources are sometimes called the "meadow magic." In order for you to access the natural resources, you must become a "good mage." This means that you learn a lot of different meadow magic. This course of study gives you great insight into the different magic systems that exist in all of magical worlds, as well as access to certain unique benefits.

Of course, you come from another world, and a magic system here is completely different from a magic system there, so before you can access the natural resources of an island, you first need to become a good mage! Once you've mastered a specific meadow magic, you can access many of the island's resources in a variety of ways. 
For example, a good tree mage may be able to chop down any trees within ten yards around his or her meadow, and then plant them afterward with whatever magical resources of the meadow its originally from. Similarly, a good leaf mage may cut down all leaves in just one area, and then place them back up to serve as "green grass". And of course, a good water mage can turn water into "ice"!

At the top of the Meadow Mage's tree, you will find a door that leads up to the magic meadow. The entrance lies right at your feet. I have placed some key card pictures before you, in case you are curious as to the various magic systems that reside in a magic meadow...


Chapter Thirty Seven
The Hanged Man

The question you are about to ask yourself is how does it work all of this? Let's start with some background on the main character of this story: the Hanged Man. Imagine having a living picture of the Hanged Man hanging outside your house. This picture may be in a museum, hanging on your walls, or even the side of a building that has a window facing out into the yard. You know where the picture is located because it is marked with the number "1" next to it. 
Now imagine a person has just killed one of their own - not a good deed! Then the next thing you know, someone has murdered this person. What happens then? The police get to know who is behind this murder and start working. They use different means of investigation to help clear the picture. If the perpetrator is an innocent person, the police may even ask the suspect a few questions before getting to the bottom of their case.

But for the people at the top of the Hanged Man, it is not enough to just arrest the perpetrator - they also need to find out exactly who the murderer is! This is exactly what the Hanged Man is trying to do! However, this task is made more difficult by the fact that the Hanged Man lives in a large apartment building that spans six floors!
Now imagine that you go up through this large apartment building for the last time! How do you know where to go from here? If you follow the picture that stands next to the door at the top of the building, you will find yourself in a garden. From the garden, you can see to the left of you is the main entrance to the building - which is marked with the number "2" on it. Going back inside of the building, there is a lot of stuff sitting around. You want to get on with your work, and while you are going through your "work rooms" (which include the bathroom, kitchen, laundry, and storage room), a voice appears inside of your head...

"Okay, this may not have been a bad thing, but the devil is lurking behind each and every piece of evidence that is being gathered to uncover

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the Universe is not completely two-dimensional!

This is what the Science News article I shared just above mentioned about my observations regarding reality (and my inability to see beyond my 3D glasses!). And I know this has been debated a lot since I wrote about this last time, but truth be told, I haven't realized this for a few years. Now, if you were going through the same experience as I, you would not be alone in your mind. Scientists and doctors have been studying the phenomenon of dimensional travel for decades now.

As I've already mentioned, I was born into a 3+1 dimensional world. However, I always felt like I belonged to another reality because of these strange experiences that we have when we are told we're not just humans, but Gods or Angels. These experiences of dimensional travel can range from an extremely unpleasant scenario to a peaceful one - all depending on that individual. In fact, as we can see by the title of this chapter, I believe there are a variety of scenarios that we can go through when we are told we're not human!  

Let's assume a deity enters into our 3D Universe (Dimension X) - and we can assume he does so without first passing through any intervening 3D space. Let's call this "entry" - or simply as "entry" - to be considered in this discussion. And let's assume that our 3+1 dimensional deity enters X without experiencing any form of acceleration, and without experiencing any force acting upon it first. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, one can't have an impact upon a mass-less particle that follows a straight line in all three dimensions! And since this is the case, the theory predicts that the deity will continue moving in the straight line that it is currently travelling through.

Now this is where things get interesting - the theory of relativity does not completely describe the physics of dimensional travel. One thing that the theories of relativity clearly predict is that gravity will play an important role in determining the direction our deity will be travelling through. And in fact, I believe that gravitational lensing can actually be used to measure the trajectory of a deity travelling through a different dimension than its own native one - by taking measurements of the image our deity is projected into the image our lens projects on the ground.

By taking this idea a step further and using gravity as a guide, we can make calculations on how our deity would experience the presence of different objects in different dimensions - by measuring the effects of gravitational lensing. And in fact, it turns out that there are situations, like this one that our deity may very well encounter!

Let's assume we are just taking this idea a step further and calculating how the gravitational lensing effect described above works. And this time I would like to introduce the term gravitational lensing! This concept originally came out of theoretical works by George Smoot and John Adams - but the term actually came from the observation of an object going through another dimension in order to measure certain distances! A lens is essentially an image of what is behind it - and if a deity can make the image appear in an image created by a lens, then you can actually make some measurements on how far your deity will travel if he were to move from Dimension X to another dimension such as Dimension Y!

Now let's assume that your deity has entered into Dimension X and that this entry is very, very short. And as we've been discussing, when our deity enters Dimension X the theory of relativity predicts that it will make a perfect straight line in all three dimensions. Now let's say our deity is taking this straight line straight up! Now imagine this deity has already completed the entry into Dimension Y. He could now travel down to Dimension Z and again be in perfect straight line. But this time we want our image (our lens) to project on the ground in a position just like our deity was in the moment of entering Dimension X. 

From the above equations you can see what happens - as we move down over the course of an image, the center of the picture shifts to the left in order to create the illusion of our lens being on the other side of the figure! And at some point when it's created, these images take on particular shape - which is exactly the result that our deity experiences in the event of entering a different dimension! I believe this is even more complicated than simple straight lines - but for now let's just call it a dimensional lens!

Now that's just the beginning. Now we need to take a slice-through of our lens, and actually compare this 3D slice to the actual three-dimensional image of our deity. And this is what our deity will experience! His image of our deity will, in fact, look exactly like the actual 3D object itself...even when the 2D image is cut into slices! To make that happen, we need to take into consideration the fact that the gravitational lensing effect will be at work when we make the slices. This means that there aren't any objects on the slices in and of themselves - they are created in order to measure something (your lens) going forward! So depending on the location of the slices, they will look different than the actual 3-D
