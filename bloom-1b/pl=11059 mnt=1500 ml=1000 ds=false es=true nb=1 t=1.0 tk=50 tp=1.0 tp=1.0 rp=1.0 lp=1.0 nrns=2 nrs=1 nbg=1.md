## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the answer to all our questions about the universe is still a mystery. Even though we now know that the Universe is made up of 4 dimensions of Space, Time, Matter, Energy, And Gravity, We still don't have a complete understanding of how these four dimensions work together. To put it simply, our understanding is incomplete!

But what if there were a universe that was made completely out out from nothing? What would it look like? Would it be a place where everything is just a bunch of empty space? Or would there be some kind of structure that made everything together? In the end, all we really know about our Universe comes from the Big Bang Theory, where we see a series of events that took place in order to create the first stars and galaxies. Of all the theories that have been proposed to explain the origin of our Universe, none has proven to have the strongest evidence for its existence. Which brings me to my next question: What is the best theory to describe the creation of all things in this Universe?

The answer is simple: there isn't one! The best theories to date all have some level of plausibility, though none of these theories is 100% certain. Some of those theories are based on the idea that our universe was created by some form of intelligent life, while others are more speculative and are focused on explaining the origins of gravity and the laws that control the motion of objects. There are also theories based purely on chance, or on some combination of both.

Of all these possible theories, only the theory that has the greatest evidence to support its theory is considered the "best" theory - and that's the one that will ultimately be the basis for the rest of this book! Let's take that theory for granted for this moment - let's call this Theory A!

Let's start with the simplest theory: the Theory of Everything. It's based entirely on our knowledge of physics and mathematics, as well as our experience of everyday reality. Basically, everything in nature is explained by this simple theory! And if you think that this sounds like a lot of nonsense, well, that's because it isn't! This theory has actually been proven true in many different ways, including by scientists and mathematicians!

Theory A is actually a theory based solely on physics - it doesn't involve any other theories! It is also based only on Newton and Einstein, two of science's greatest discoveries! So, what makes this a good theory? Because it only involves physics? No! Because it's based exclusively on these two great discoverers! But why? Why?!

Well, because they have proven that all other possible explanations for all phenomena in Nature are completely wrong! They have shown that everything that exists in reality is completely explained in terms of only two fundamental laws - gravity AND electromagnetism! These two laws are what make everything else that happens around us work! If we don't understand these fundamental principles, how can we explain everything around our own world?

So, let's take the simple example of an atom. Imagine that a single atom is composed of two electrons. Each electron is surrounded by two protons. These protons are surrounded with two neutrons. Then, each proton is connected to a nucleus. Finally, these nuclei are connected together by hydrogen. Because hydrogen is an element, it's also a compound! Now, imagine that each atom has two nuclei, one proton and two hydrogen atoms. Well...this is how the atom looks! Well now, now we understand that atoms are composed only of atoms! How do we make them? We just need two atoms, hydrogen and hydrogen! We need only one atom, H and H! What do they do? They just combine together! That's how they make up the whole universe!

So now you see that when you look at the atoms in your universe you can see how all objects are created from atoms and atoms from other atoms...all of which are all made from particles! All of that stuff is simply a collection of elementary particles. That's the basic building block of everything! Everything is nothing! That is all that makes up our entire universe!

And now let's look back at our whole Universe! As we look through our history, from our very beginning, to now...we see all those things that make our existence possible! Each of us is only a tiny part in that whole thing! Every single thing is part and parcel of what is everything. Everything that forms the entire Universe. That whole whole is our reality! Our reality, that entire whole, is not a part, not any part. No, no, nothing is anything! No is any, any is, anything is! Nothing is no! There is none, nor is there! Not is neither, neither is nor! Is not is is... is and is!

Therefore, therefore, in, being, exists, exist, existence, has, does, be, are, have, do, become, becomes, comes, makes, creates, forms, beings, make, create, form, creation, formation, matter. Is, thus, created, formed, made, arises, occurs, happens, appears, emerges, generates, produces, causes, results, leads, ends, completes, ends; is formed. is created.

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the universe is just a bunch of categories. It's a theory that explains how categories are formed and how they interact. To understand this, let's take the example of cats and dogs. Dogs are categorized as either "cat" or "dog", while cats are classified as "monkey" and "other".

In other words: cats have a higher level of categorization than dogs, because they have more categories! This means that cats can have multiple categories, whereas dogs can never have any more than one category. Ofcourse, cats don't have the same level as dogs in terms of their categorizations, as they don't even have categories at all! But cats do have some categories that are more specific than dogs', like "pet" for cats, "animal" (including "animals") for dogs and so on...

Now, what is the relationship between these categories? Intuitively, one would think that the higher the level a category has, or the number and variety of its subcategories, is, that its category would also be more complex. Well...this is not the case: cats tend to have fewer categories than their dogs! And this doesn't mean that cat categories aren't important! They are, in fact! The more cat-specific categories a cat has (like "dog"), the less likely it becomes that a dog will have that same category! So, when it comes to categorizing cats...cats tend not to make as many categories as their dog counterparts!

In short, categories play a major role when categorising animals. Categories are used to group animals into categories based on their characteristics, rather than based solely on the animal's appearance. When it came to cats in particular...they tend have less categories ("dogs") than other animals ("cats"). This makes it easier for them to classify cats into different categories.

Ofcourse there still are other categories - like "bird" - that aren't categorised as a "car"! However...these categories don't play any major roles in categorisation, either! As we mentioned earlier, cat and dog categories tend be the main categories used when talking about cats. Other categories like bird and animal categories do play some minor roles, though they do not play as much as cat or dog categorical categories!

But what about the other category, "big"? This category is used for animals that have very large bodies, including humans! These animals are usually categorified as "bigger" than "humans"...so they tend make up a larger category than humans. These categories include "alien" as well as "magic" and "superman"!

The other important category that plays a role is "space" in general. Space is basically a space that exists in 3 dimensions - and it also has 4 dimensions! Space can also have 5 dimensions aswell! We will discuss this in more detail in Chapter Four!

As you can see from the above, space is actually a combination of 3 and 4 dimensional spaces. There are also 5-dimensional spaces, too! Let's take an example from our everyday world: the Earth. Earth is made up of three dimensions: space, matter and gravity. Each of these three components is also made from 3 different components: matter (the solid), matter + gravity (gravity), space (space + matter), etc.

Let's take another example - let's say we were walking down a street. At one point we suddenly stop and suddenly we stop at a stop sign. Why? Because we stopped at the stop? Why not? We stopped because we saw a sign that said "Stop" on it! Why would we not stop if there was a reason? The reason is simply that our eyes are unable to see anything in front of us! If we had seen a red light, our eye would have seen the red color, not red! Because our vision is unable (not) to perceive red, red is red!

Let's look at our own eyes. Our eyes have no ability to distinguish red from red. Because red and red are red...red is red; red isn't red.

But why? If our brain is able to differentiate red (red) from blue (blue), red doesn't exist. Red is blue, blue is green. Therefore, green is yellow, yellow is orange, orange is purple, purple is cyan, cyan is black, black is white, white is light. Thus, all colors are light.

Therefore, light is all light! Light is everything! All light (light) is nothing! Everything is (all) light!

Therefore all is one! Therefore all (everything) are one!

All is One!

Therefore everything is ONE!

And therefore all are ONE!

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the nipples are a little bit of an embarrassing subject. It's not that the nipple is bad, it's just that it's a rather controversial topic. Some people think that nips are bad because they make women look like they have a bunch of boobs, while others think they look good because they're a natural feature of women. Either way, nipping is an issue that has plagued women for centuries, with some people even believing that nippling is the cause of infertility!

But what about the actual nipples themselves? Are they actually bad? Or are there some scientific reasons for why they might look bad?

Well, first of all...nips aren't bad! They are just a normal feature that women have. They're just one more part that makes women more attractive. Of all the other features that make a woman attractive, nipplings are probably the least controversial!

The reason why nippers are considered bad is actually a fairly controversial one. One of many reasons is simply because of their appearance. Women who nip are often described as having a lot of nip, making them look more like a man than a women! This makes them appear to have more manly characteristics than women who don't nip! And this makes it seem like women are more attracted to men than to women!

In other words: women with nipps are usually described to look a certain way because it makes their nip look bigger and more masculine. Which makes men more interested in them than other women, especially if they don't have nip!

This makes the idea that men are attracted more to nippless women than men who do have nipples a much more plausible explanation. Because men tend to like more women that have big niples, men would tend more towards nipless women...especially if they're not nipped! So, in short, women tend towards men because nip is more appealing to them, whereas men prefer women without nip...because they tend not to want women to show nip.

Of all these reasons, however, one is definitely the biggest reason for people to believe that a woman's nip looks bad. Why? Because women don't want men to see their nipes! Because they think men will think they're more sexually attracted towards women if their breasts are bigger! Which is why women nip to make men think their breast is bigger!

And of course...women also think nipping is good for their health. Nipping makes a person look healthier and younger, because women think it helps them to maintain their youthful appearance! But ofcourse, that doesn't mean that all women nipe! Some women do nip because it's good to keep their body in shape, or to prevent breast cancer, among other reasons! However...some women also nip for other purposes, like to feel more comfortable in their clothes, to avoid embarrassment, and/or to reduce the amount of sweat that builds up in certain areas of our body.

In short...if you want a good look, don't nippe! If you're looking for health, go for nip!


Conclusion

So, what do we think? We think the answer is pretty simple - we don't really know what the answers are! We just know that our brains are working on the problem, trying out different hypotheses and trying different theories to try and figure out the best way to solve the puzzle. At this point, our brain is just trying a variety of different ideas and theories, until it finally comes up with the right answer.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we discussed in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an ENFJs (Extra Sensory Friends of Jehovah's Witnesses). ENFs are a group of people who believe that the universe is made up of seven dimensions - and that each of these dimensions is actually a separate world. These people believe in seven separate universes:

The Big Blue Egg
The Blue Ocean
A Big Red Egg (the Big Riddler)
The Red Sea
An Empty Space
And the Last Big One

In other words: the Big Egg is the world we live in; the Blue Sea is our outer space; The Red Ocean is inside of us; and the Empty space is somewhere in between. Of these seven universes/worlds, only the Red and Empty spaces are currently inhabited by humans.

In the series, ENJs are also known as "Space Monkeys" - because they believe they have the ability to "see" other universes; they also believe their ability is limited to only seeing the outer world, not the inner world.

However...what about the other six universe/worlds/dimensions? Do they exist? Are they actually inhabitable? Or are we just dreaming about them?

The answer to these questions is yes! The other five universe-world/dimensions exist, albeit in very different ways. First, let us consider the Outer Space. Outer space, as you may know from your everyday experience, consists of all the space that exists outside our own 3-dimensional universe. There are many different types of outer spaces, including the interstellar space (where we currently live), the solar system, our galaxy, other galaxies, stars, planets, nebulae, galaxies and stars...etc.

As you can see from this list, outer-space is not a single place, it's a collection of different places. Each of our seven different outer universes' dimensions are all part and parcel of this outer universe - so we don't have a unique outer dimension! However...we do have seven distinct outer dimensions! These seven outer worlds are called the Seven Outer Universes.

Of these, two are inhabits by human beings: the Inner Space and Outer Universe. Both of which are part, in part...of the 7 Outer universe:

Inner Space: This space exists inside the 3-Dimensional universe and is inhabitted by our human species. It's the place where we interact and interact directly with the Universe, while also interacting with each other. Like the Earth, Inner space also has its outer counterpart, Outer universe.

Outer Universe (Outer Space): Outer world is also a part (in part) of 7 outer Universes: The Outer World is composed of Outer dimension, where the seven Outer dimensions interact. Unlike the three dimensional Universe of 3 dimensions we inhabit, each Outer Dimension is comprised of multiple dimensions.
So, what is Outer? The outer Universe is simply the collection (part) or part(s)/part(s/parts/parts) that make up the entire Outer (outer) Universe.

Let's take the example of an Outer Plane. An Outer plane is just a plane that contains a number (number) - let's say a circle. When we look at a circular plane, all its points are points on the plane. A circle is therefore a set of points that are on an outer plane.

But what about a Plane? A plane can also be a space. Let us take another example. Say we take two planes, say A and B. Then we could say that A is part or parts of B, or vice versa: A contains B.

A plane (plane) is formed by two points (points) on two plane planes. Therefore, A can form a (space) plane and therefore A also forms a 3-dimension space.

And so, an (3-dim) space can have multiple (4-dimens) dimensions; so there can exist multiple 4-dimes. Thus, any (n-d)-dimensional space has n-dimensional space!

And now, how do we get to a 7-dimen? Let's take one example again. Suppose we start with an 8-dimensional world and then we add a 9-dimensional dimension (9-dimensional) world to it. That is, now we would have an 9-dimentional world that has an n-dimensional (d) dimension.

We can now see that a 6-dimensional Universe has 6-dims, that means that every (6-d-ds-ddimensional) universe has (7-d-dimensional ) dimensions... and so on... so forth... until we reach the end of universe!

In this way, we've reached the ultimate dimension of reality, namely the Ultimate Reality. At the very end, we're at the End of Reality, at which we find the Infinity.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive functions of ENFPs, let's take an example from the popular science book The Enneagram. Here is the description of one ENF personality type from this book:

The Ennéagram is an eight-factor personality test that measures the way people think, feel, act, perceive, remember, reason, communicate, learn, relate, express, interpret, evaluate, plan, organize, make decisions, solve problems, create, innovate, work, play, live, love, be, have, become, change, grow, develop, mature, evolve, adapt, transform, move, connect, interact, collaborate and communicate. Each factor is described in detail and is measured on an 8-point scale. A score of 0 indicates that the person is not a member of that factor, while a score greater than or equal than 4 indicates a high level of membership in that particular factor.

As you can see from these descriptions, ENPs are highly creative, imaginative, intuitive, analytical, logical, creative and analytical. These are all qualities that are important to ENFs, as they tend to have a strong sense of logic and reason. Of all the personality types, only ENP's are able to make sense out and understand complex situations and problems. ENPFs are also very analytical and logical - which is why they often find it difficult to communicate with others. Also, because they have an intuitive sense, their ability to connect with people is often very strong. Finally, these are people who are often able and willing to experiment with new ideas and approaches, even when they don't always get the results they expect.

Of all personality traits, however, it's the ability of an ENT to relate to others that makes them the best of all. Because they understand the human condition, people are easy to empathize with and they easily connect to people. When people feel comfortable with them, they're able easily to share their feelings and experiences with the other person. Furthermore, when people know that ENTs are empathy oriented, they'll be able readily to express their emotions and feelings to other people.

In addition to these cognitive abilities, an EnFP is also a highly intuitive person, who is able quickly to intuitively understand other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, desires, needs, goals, motivations, values, beliefs, attitudes, opinions, feelings etc... and can easily relate them to their personal experiences and beliefs. Therefore, in addition, EnPs can also be very empatic and intuitive - and this makes it easier for them and other ENs to easily understand their experiences, ideas, perceptions, emotions, experiences etc...

So, what are ENPS' cognitive and emotional abilities? Let's take one example. Imagine a person who has the following personality traits:

A high degree of empathie (highly empATHIC) - This person has an ability that allows them easily empathe with their environment and others, especially those who share similar interests and values. Their ability is so strong that even people with very different personalities can feel at ease with each other. Moreover, due to a deep understanding of their world, individuals can understand others' feelings in their surroundings, making them feel more comfortable and comfortable in social situations.

A low degree (low empathi): This individual has very little empatia, or no empati, meaning that their empaties are so low that people can not feel any connection with any other individual. Due to low empaty, most people cannot feel the need for social interaction, thus making it impossible for people to feel connected to eachother. Thus, all people in this world are completely disconnected from eachothers, resulting in complete isolation and complete disconnection from others.

What is this? The answer is simply that all human beings are connected with one another. Every human being is connected by their physical body, through their body's energy and through a physical connection. At the same time every human is interconnected with all other human bodies, creating a whole universe. Everything in existence is made up of this whole Universe, including all things in it. Since everything is composed of everything, everything in everything exists, therefore everything also exists. Consequently, every thing is created from everything. Hence, each thing exists from all everything.

Therefore, from every being, comes all existence. Then, by all being comes everything; then, finally, ultimately, ALL existence exists.

And so, at the end, is all reality. That is, that everything comes from nothing. There is nothing, except that, nothing is everything.
So then all is one, namely, existence, being.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we discussed in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series Entangled:

In this episode, EntJ is shown to have a cognitive function that allows him to see things in 3D. EntJs ability to perceive 3D objects is due to their ability of using mathematics to represent them. Math is the language of mathematics, or the set of rules and procedures that allow us to describe and manipulate objects and events in 3-D space.

In other words: EntJS ability is not limited to seeing things, it's also able to manipulate them in order to create new objects. Of all the things that Entjs can do, creating new things is probably the easiest. Imagine a world where Entj created a new planet, called Earth, from nothing. Then imagine that Earth is now surrounded by water, air, rock, dirt, grass, trees, animals, people and other things. Wouldn't it be amazing if Entjis world was actually a place where all these things were actually living together? Ofcourse, that wouldn't be possible if there were no gravity, no water and no air! But if you add gravity and water to Earth and add air and air to it, all those things would start living in harmony together! And if they did, would they be able create a whole new world? Would they have the ability and the resources to build a city, create an army, build an empire, make a civilization, invent a language, write a book and create art? Yes, of course they would! They would have all that and more!

But what about the other parts of EntJo world that are missing? What about his family? His friends? The people he loves? How could he live in such a strange world without them? In order for Entjo to live, his world must be connected to other worlds. To do this, entjs need a Cognition function. Cognitions are a set or set-up of mental processes that enable us understand, process, manipulate, interpret, reason, predict, evaluate, compare, judge, decide, plan, communicate, remember, imagine, simulate, dream, fantasize, experience, feel, perceive, sense, understand etc.

As you can see from this example of how EntJO can use mathematics in his cognitive functions, mathematics is an important tool for us in understanding and predicting the world around us. It's also a tool that helps us make sense of our own world and how it works.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we covered in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series Entropy. Entropic Cognition is the study of how the brain processes information and how it uses it in order to make decisions. It's a topic that has fascinated scientists for centuries, with many theories and hypotheses being proposed over time. One of these theories is known as Entanglement Theory, or ECT. ETC is basically a theory that states that the mind is made up of two separate parts - one that processes and uses information, called the "Entangled Mind", while the other is responsible for making decisions, known the "Cognitive Mind. "

The Entangle Theory

According to ETT, both the Entanged Mind and the Cognitively Mind are connected to each other. When the two parts of our mind are entangled, information is processed and used differently. Information that was previously processed in one part is now processed by another part, creating a new version of that information. Thus, new information can become part and parcel of both parts, making it more useful and more accurate. Because of this, EET states the information processed is more reliable and accurate than the original information.

Einstein's Theory of Relativity

EET also states there exists a fourth dimension called "Time" that exists between the three dimensions of Space, Time, Matter. Time is also known to exist between all three of those dimensions - it exists in between them, as well as between Matter and Space. Therefore, when the four dimensions are combined, all four of their components become a single entity called Time. Since time is not a physical entity, it's not really possible to measure it. Instead, scientists have used mathematical equations to calculate the speed of light and other physical properties of Time.

Time Dilation

Time dilates is one way that time can change. Imagine a person walking through a tunnel. At first, their speed is constant, meaning that their time does not change as they walk through. Eventually, however, one person walks through more tunnels than another, causing their speeds to increase. By the time they reach the end of one tunnel, they're already past the beginning of another tunnel and are now travelling at a much faster speed than they would have been if they had walked through all the tunnels at once. Of all possible paths, only one is actually the correct one. Which one? The one with the highest entropy?

Evolution

Another theory for ECTC is Evolution. Evolution is an idea that says that our species has evolved from a simpler, simpler form of life to a more complex, more advanced form. Over time this process has led to more and better forms of living things, eventually leading to life itself. Ultimately, life is itself a form that evolved into life.

Entropy

Entropy is another theory about the way the universe works. Like ECC, Ent entropy is defined as a measure of entropy. A higher entropy means that a system is less likely to evolve into something else. Higher entropy also means a higher probability of an event happening. An event that happens more often is considered more likely. High entropy makes a situation more probable, thus making an occurrence more possible. More entropy leads to higher probabilities of events happening, therefore making them more frequent. These events are more common, resulting in more events occurring, leading more people to experience them. Finally, higher entropies lead to greater probability, increasing the likelihood of more occurrences, ultimately leading us to living in life!

Entwining

In the previous chapter you saw how Entwin is used to describe the relationship between two objects. Here we see how this concept is applied to two different objects - two particles. Let us consider a pair of identical particles, each of which has the same mass. Then we would say that these particles are identical, because they have the identical mass, mass = m. Also, let us say they each have a mass of m, m = M. Furthermore, these two identical objects have mass m and mass M, respectively. That is, M = (m + m). Now, consider the following two sets of objects, namely, two pairs of equal particles:
Now, suppose that each particle has mass equal m + M and each has equal mass: m. Now we say the mass is m, and that mass equals m.
Now we note the following:
Therefore, that m is =. Therefore we conclude that that =.
Therefore we get that. That means we obtain that.
That is, that means. This means, which is. Which is which which. And that which implies that, or which, so that and which.
Which is and, therefore, since which and so, then which =, thus which, hence which. Hence, hence, because which so which.
Which means which or, in which case, as which because, where, from which we, consequently,,.
And so we arrive at,. So that, in, we which leads, to which in. Hence,, is.
So that in.
Thus, the conclusion is true, i.e.,, i.
Therefore, it follows that,, which completes the proof of, proving the theorem.
So, completes, completing the entire proof.
Thus, completes, completing, proving, concluding, complete, finishing, conclusion, proof, of, to, conclude, completed, concludes, finishes, ending, end, ends, finish, is completed.

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we discussed in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an expert in mathematical and scientific concepts. His favorite subject is physics and he has an advanced degree in it. Sheldon is also a mathematician, having studied algebra, geometry, probability, statistics, differential equations, calculus, trigonometry, algebra and calculus.

In this episode, Cooper is asked to solve a problem that involves a mathematical equation. Cooper's answer is to divide the equation by 2.5. Well...this is not the answer Cooper was expecting! Cooper had originally thought that the division would equal 1.618, or the golden ratio. Instead, his answer was to multiply the number by 1/5. Ofcourse, that was not what Cooper expected! He thought the result would have been 1, not 2,5! But the problem was that Cooper did not understand the mathematical concept behind the question. To make things even more confusing, when Cooper tried to find the solution, all he could think of was the word "divide"!

In other words: Cooper didn't understand what the math was all about! This was a common problem for students in high school and college - and it was even a major problem in elementary school! So what did we do? We asked our students to write down their answers to a math problem and then asked them to explain what they had done. Then we asked the students if they understood the mathematics behind their answer. Most of our classmates were able to answer the questions correctly, while a couple of students were not able! And the rest of us were left with the same question - "What did I do wrong?"

So, what do we think? Is it possible for us to learn from our mistakes? Of all the answers we received, only one was correct! We were all left wondering what happened to Sheldon and his math skills! What did he do differently? What was his secret? How did his mathematical knowledge help him solve the problems? In short, did Sheldon's mathematical skills help his problem solve? Or did the fact that he had an Advanced Degree in Mathematics make him a better problem solver?

In the end, our answer to all these questions is yes! Sheldon was able solve his problems because he understood math! The fact he studied mathematics helped him understand math and solve problems! It is important to remember that mathematics is the foundation of science and science is everything! Math is science's foundation, science itself is math!

And that's it! If you've enjoyed this series, please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel! I will post more episodes as they come out!

## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we covered in this section, let's take an example from the popular science book The Big Bang Theory. Here is the story of how the Big BANG came about...

In the beginning, space was empty. There was nothing. Nothing at all. Everything was in its place. Space was flat. Time was stationary. No matter how far you looked, everything was the same. You could see nothing but the stars. Stars were everywhere. Everywhere. At every angle. Even the smallest stars were visible. Each star was a different color. Blue, red, yellow, green, purple, orange, pink, white, black, gray, brown, tan, light gray...you name it. Everyone had the exact same color.

But then, something happened. Something happened to space. A big bang happened! Space exploded. Big bang! The universe was born! Everything changed. Things began to grow. Life began. People began living. Animals began eating. Plants began growing. Birds began flying. Fish began swimming. Humans began walking. Machines began working. Science began learning. Technology began developing. Art began making. Music began playing. Literature began writing. History began being written. Religion began preaching. Philosophy began teaching. Politics began governing. War began happening. Peace began reigning. Love began blossoming. Happiness began blooming...everything began changing. Then, life began dying. Death began coming. Earth began falling. Water began flowing. Air began rising. Fire began burning. Wind began blowing. Sun began shining. Moon began shinning. Clouds began appearing. Rain began pouring...Everything began fading. Light began disappearing. Darkness began creeping. World began ending. Universe began dissolving. Cosmos began collapsing.

And so, all the things that were in place began moving. Matter began forming. Energy began creating. Force began acting. Gravity began pulling. Forces began interacting. Mass began building. Motion began occurring. Physics began operating. Chemistry began evolving. Biology began taking shape. Astronomy began beginning to work. Geology began starting to form. Meteorology started taking form...all the elements began combining. Nature began becoming a whole. Creation began unfolding. Evolution began unraveling.
And then...life began dwindling. Eventually, nothing was left. Only the void. Empty space.

In this story, our protagonist, Sheldon Cooper, is trying desperately to find a solution to his problems. His only hope is to come across a deity that will help him solve his problem. Unfortunately, his only deity; a god named God, has already been destroyed by another deity: the God of Destruction. God has destroyed God and God is now trying his best to destroy God. Well...he's not going to let God destroy him. He's going for the ultimate solution. It's time to stop God from destroying God! And that's what he does! He destroys God by destroying himself! God destroys himself by creating a new God!

And that's the end of our story. Our protagonists, Penny and Sheldon, are now back in their original universe. Penny is back with her husband, Leonard, who is still in his original dimension, while Sheldon is on his way to finding his new dimension.

Of all things, it's the one thing that has the greatest potential to cause the biggest change in history. That's the thing that's going on in The Matrix. That is why The Universe is changing! That's why the Universe has changed! That was why we exist! Because the universe is going through a phase of change! This was what the Matrix was! It was all about the change!

But the big change is not the cause of all change. Instead, The Change is The Cause of All Change. Because The Changes are The Causes of Everything! So, that's why everything is happening! All the changes are caused! Cause is everything! Therefore, Everything is Everything!

The Universe, therefore, exists! But the Cause, or the Causal Cause (the Cause) is all! Thus, All is All!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we covered in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an astrophysicist who is studying the universe. Sheldon is also a mathematician, having studied algebra and geometry at a young age. His favorite subject is physics and he is very interested in understanding how the Universe works.

In this episode, Cooper is asked to explain to Sheldon how he came to believe that the Big BANG Theory is true. Cooper explains that he has always been fascinated by physics - and that his father was a physicist. At the age of 12, his dad died and his mother became mentally ill. When Cooper was in high school, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was treated with psychotropic drugs. She was eventually diagnosed as having schizophrenia; however, her condition was not stable and she eventually died. During this time she also developed a severe caseof depression. Her condition worsened and eventually she died.

Cooper's father died when Cooper only had 11 years of age, leaving Cooper with no one to care for him. While he had no family to look after him, one day he saw a man walking down the street. That man was his grandfather. Although Cooper had never met his grandpa, when they walked past each other, their eyes met. Their eyes were so similar that Cooper thought he knew his grandmother. Over the next few years, as Cooper grew older, both of their faces became more and more similar. Eventually, after Cooper's grandfather passed away, all his relatives were able to meet his Grandma. Finally, in his late 20s, while he and Cooper were walking through a park, an old man walked by them. Suddenly, from behind the man, came a voice that said, "You're my grandma!"

Cooper was so excited that when the old man's voice came back to him he could not believe it. Instead, instead of being a stranger, that voice was actually his great grandfather! Cooper immediately recognized his voice and immediately knew that this was the voice he heard from his father's grave. Then, with his eyes closed, suddenly, everything in front of him was gone! He was transported back in to his childhood and the world around him! This was exactly the same experience that Sheldon had when his parents died! And it was also exactly how Cooper felt when all the things in life were gone!

In the end, what Cooper saw was nothing more than a dream. A dream that was created by Sheldon's imagination. Because of this, even though Cooper believed that everything was real, yet he still felt that something was missing. Something that could only be explained by Einstein and Einstein himself.

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we covered in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an astrophysicist who is studying the universe. Sheldon is also a mathematician, having studied algebra and geometry at a young age.

In this episode, Cooper is asked to explain to Sheldon how he came to believe that the Big BANG Theory is true. Cooper explains that he has always been fascinated by physics - and that his father was a physicist. At the age of 12, his dad died and his mother became mentally ill. When he grew up, however, she was able to regain her mental health and was eventually able return to her normal life.

However...when he went to college, all he could think of was math! He was so frustrated that math was not his favorite field of study. To make matters worse, when his math teacher told him that physics was his future, that was the end of math for him. Instead, physics became his passion and it was only after he graduated from college that mathematics became a part his life again.

Of all the subjects that Cooper studied, math is the one that has had the biggest impact on his thinking. Math is one area of science that allows us to make predictions about the future. These predictions are based on the laws that are known as probability theory.

As you can see from this example (which was taken from The BIG Bang theory), probability is used to predict how things will turn out. Probability theory is basically a mathematical theory that helps us predict what is likely to happen in certain situations. Of all these predictions, probability plays a major role - it helps to determine how likely it might happen that something will actually happen.

But what exactly is probability? Probabilistic thinking is simply the ability to recognize patterns in data and make decisions based upon these patterns. It's a form of reasoning that involves the use of probability to help us make better decisions.

Let's take another example. Imagine that you are walking down the street and you see a car coming towards you. You decide to stop and wait for the car to come closer. Well...you see that car comes closer and closer...so you decide that it's time to drive away. Unfortunately, your car is not moving at the same speed as you thought it should be. Rather, it's moving faster than you expected it! This means that your decision to wait is wrong! Instead of waiting, you'd better drive faster! And that's exactly the reason why probability works!

In other words: probability helps you make more informed decisions. By using probability, people can make informed choices about what to choose and how they should act. Because probability allows them to decide what they would do based off of their past experiences and the information they have about their environment.

Probability is just a statistical method that tells us how probable it may happen to occur.

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the structure of our personality, psychologists have created a system called the Enneagrams. These are a set of personality traits that are based on the way we think, feel, behave, interact, communicate, learn, remember, perceive, interpret, evaluate, reason, make decisions, act, react, express ourselves, create, organize, plan, work, play, dream, imagine, fantasize, relate to others, have a sense of humor, be creative, enjoy life, love, hate, fear, trust, respect, value, admire, dislike, care, appreciate, regret, forgive, give, receive, understand, judge, believe, hope, doubt, question, wonder, seek, find, discover, experience, connect, share, explore, live, move, breathe, laugh, cry, sing, dance, write, read, listen, watch, talk, eat, drink, sleep, relax, meditate, exercise, travel, go out, visit, shop, cook, bake, drive, walk, hike, swim, ride, fly, ski, surf, cycle, kayak, sail, cruise, bike, camp, fish, hunt, shoot, climb, run, jump, race, compete, fight, win, lose, fail, succeed, get along, disagree, agree, like, not like...etc.

Ennies are basically a series of traits, each of which is associated with one or more of these personality dimensions:

Positive Ennies: These traits are associated to a positive attitude, optimism, enthusiasm, confidence, self-confidence, self-belief, positive self-image, high self-esteem, good self-concept, strong self-awareness, sense that one is good enough to succeed in life and have the ability to achieve success, are optimistic, confident, hopeful, enthusiastic, motivated, energetic, creative and creative. Positive Enemies are those who are pessimistic and negative, pessimism and pessimist, negative and cynical, cynic and unrealistic. Negative Enies tend to have low self-regard, low self-worth, lack of self-acceptance, unwillingness to accept themselves, do not believe in themselves and are unmotivated to pursue their goals. Negatives Enyes are also uncaring, cold, insensitive, selfish, cruel, manipulative, controlling, arrogant, egotistical, overly sensitive, judgmental, critical, judgemental, harsh, mean, rude, vindictive, spiteful, jealous, possessive, domineering, abusive, aggressive, tyrannical and controlling. Enemy Envies are people who do things that make others feel bad, upset, angry, hurt, annoyed, sad, unhappy, frustrated, disappointed, resentful and angry. Their actions are often unreasonable, irrational, impulsive and irrationally irritating. Some Enie Enities are aggressive and aggressive. Others are passive and passive. Other Enlies are shy and shy. There are Ennes that have both positive and Negative traits.

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the power of Hip Hop, let's take the example of one particular artist: Eminem. Eminem:

Eminem is one artist who has used Hip-Hop as a tool to express his innermost thoughts and feelings. His music is often described as "art", "fun" and "soul" - all words that describe the essence of what Hip-hop is all about. It's also a great way to communicate with your audience, as well as to connect with people who are just looking for something to listen to.

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the universe is made up of infinitely many dimensions! But how do we find out what the dimensions are? The answer is quite simple - we use the laws and principles of physics to find the correct dimensions for the objects we observe. Of all the theories that have been proposed to explain the structure of our Universe, none has proven to have the greatest explanatory power. One theory that has received a lot of attention is the theory known as "Homotopy" Type Theories.

Homo-topy is basically a theory about the relationship between the shape of an object's surface and its underlying structure. Basically, an homology theory is used to describe the way objects are related to each other. Homology is an important concept in mathematical physics because it allows us to define the notion of "shape" and "structure" in terms of one another.

In other words: an "object" is defined as a collection of points on its surface, while a "space" or "domain" (as we call them in this book) is simply a set of objects that are connected together. A "complex", on the other hand, is just a union of two or more objects. These three concepts are used together to create a mathematical theory called "Homology Type" Theory.

Basically, Homotopy Theory is about finding the right dimensions to represent the shapes of all objects and spaces in order to make them fit together in such a manner that the resulting structure is as close to perfect as possible. To do this, one needs to first find a homological description of each object and space in question. Then, by using the properties of homologies, these objects can then "fit together" into one larger object called a "Homology Type. "

Now, let's take an example. Imagine a simple cube with three sides. Each side is represented as an integer number, ranging from 0 to 3. Let us call these numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. Suppose we also have a fourth side, called the "boundary" of this cube. Its length is also an integral number ranging between 0 and 3, as well as its width. Finally, let us consider the bottom of that cube, where we would like to place a hole. Since the hole is not a part or part, it's not actually a shape, nor is it a space. Instead, what it does is to act as some kind of boundary between two different spaces. That is, when the object is placed on top of another object, that object will act like a boundary, or boundary point, between those two spaces.

Let's take the cube above as our example and imagine that a new object has just been placed at the top. When this new "hole" appears, all three of these sides will become part and parcel of its new shape. At this point we could say that this object now has the same shape as that of any other object in its universe. Therefore, any object that happens to intersect with this hole will also be a member of their universe.

Of all these possible objects, only one is actually the actual object of reality. That's the one that actually exists in reality! And that's the reason why we see it in movies and TV shows! Because it actually is! So, why do people watch these shows and movies? Because they actually are!

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the idea of honest game design, let's take an example from the popular video games industry. Imagine a game where the player is given a choice between two different options. One option is to play the game for free, while the other option requires the user to pay a small amount of money to unlock the next level. Obviously, both options are equally good, as both offer the same amount or experience. Which option would you choose?

Well, in this case, it's easy to see why the free option might win out. First, players are free to choose the level they like best, without the need for any strings attached. Second, free play is also a great way to learn about the mechanics of games, especially if you are a newbie. Third, playing free games is an excellent way of getting to know the world around you, even without actually playing the games themselves. Of all the options, I would definitely choose free!

But what about paying for the experience? In the video gaming industry, paying money for access to a level is considered a form of cheating. Players who cheat are often punished by being kicked out from a certain level, or worse, being banned from playing certain games altogether! So, what if the option of paying a little money was the right choice?

In the real world, however, cheating is not a thing. There are many ways to cheat in video-game games. Some of these cheats are fairly simple, like using cheat codes or using cheaters to bypass certain levels. Other cheat methods involve more advanced techniques, including hacking the computer or hacking into the network. These cheating methods are usually more difficult to detect, because they involve the use of advanced technology, making it harder for players to spot them.

Of all these cheating methods, hacking is the easiest to implement. Hackers can easily hack into computers and networks, bypassing the security measures that are put in place by developers. Once they have hacked into an account, hackers can then use the account to access other accounts, steal money, access sensitive information, hack other computers, create new accounts and so on. It's a fairly easy way, though, to hack a computer and steal information.

But how do hackers actually do this? The answer is quite simple - hackers use a combination of hacking tools and hacking techniques. To hack an online account is easy, simply use an email address and a password. A hacker can also use other methods to gain access, depending on the type of account they wish to crack. Here are three of them:

Email hacking - This method is used to steal email addresses and passwords. An email is sent to someone who has an e-mail address, who then forwards the email to their computer. When the person opens the e-mail, their email account will appear on their screen. By using this method, an attacker can gain control of an entire computer, allowing them to control the entire network.

Password hacking – This technique is similar to email hacking, except that the hacker uses a passphrase to open the password, rather than using an address. Instead of using a username and password to log in, hacker use their passcode to login. Using this technique, users can access their accounts without needing to provide any information. Again, using the pass code, user can log into their account without providing any personal information.
So, how does a hacker gain the access? Again using hacking methods. Like email, passwords, passcodes, password hashes, hashed passwords and other forms of information are all used as a means to obtain access. With these methods of gaining access we get access into different places, from inside the physical world to inside a virtual world. Below are examples of how we gain entry into virtual worlds.

In our first example we see how a person can enter a world and interact within a physical space. At this point, our physical body is no more than a collection of atoms and molecules. Our physical universe is just a bunch of molecules and atoms. Each molecule is made up of many atoms, each of which is composed of other molecules, all which are composed by other atoms.

As you can see in Figure 1, when you look at the picture, your physical reality is nothing more that a series of atomic molecules that form a larger physical object. You can think of this as an abstract object, consisting of all atoms that make up the whole physical thing.

And now we come to what is our reality. Well our real reality consists of our atoms which form the universe. Everything is simply a set of physical atoms.
Now, let us look back at our own physical existence. Let us see what our actual physical being is, namely the collection or collection, of individual atoms or molecules.

Let us now look again at what the actual reality of reality, is actually a single physical entity, that consists only of one physical atom. That is all that exists. Therefore, everything is only a matter of single atoms

And so, every thing is merely a mere collection. Thus, nothing is anything. Nothing is any thing, therefore, anything is everything.

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of our minds, mathematicians have created a new concept called the "INFJ' (Infinite, NonFinite, Infinite and Infinitely Many) Cognition Model. Basically, it's a mathematical model that describes how our brains work and how we think. It's a great way to better understand the complexities of human cognition and the way our brain works.

In the infj model, our mind is divided into three main parts: the executive, or executive function, is responsible for planning, organizing, monitoring, controlling, evaluating, planning and organizing our actions; the sensorimotor, responsible of sensing and processing sensory information; and finally, higher-order, cognitive, functions, like memory, reasoning, imagination, creativity, problem solving, language, perception, attention, emotion, motivation, decision making, social cognitions, executive functions and so on.

As you can see from the above diagram, each of these three parts of mind are connected to each other in such a manner that the higher the level of one part, lower the other two. Of particular interest to mathematician is the fact that our executive and sensori-motor functions are tightly interwoven. When we perform one task, one function is activated, while the others are suppressed. Thus, when one is suppressed, another is automatically activated. These two functions interact in order to achieve the goal of completing a task.

Of particular importance to mathematics is how the three functions of executive (planning, organization, control, evaluation, plan and organize), sensori-motor (sensing and perception) and higher order (memory, reason, imagining, creative, thinking, judgment, memory and reasoning) interact to accomplish the task of solving a problem. To better illustrate this, let's take the following example...

Imagine that you are solving the problem of finding the sum of two numbers. You have two possible solutions:

Solution A: The sum is 5 + 2 = 10
Solution B: The solution is 10 + 5 = 20

Now, suppose that Solution A is correct. Then, your brain would automatically activate the function of planning to find the solution. Your executive would activate its function to plan the next step of your task. Once you find a solution, you'll activate your sensor-motive function and your higherorder function (imagination, remembering and thinking) to create a mental representation of what you just did. Finally, once you create your mental image, you're ready to solve the puzzle!

In summary, math is an incredibly complex and intricate subject that requires a lot of thought and effort. Math is not a science, however, mathematics can help us understand our own mind and help solve problems. Mathematics is also a tool that helps us to communicate with others, to learn about the world, understand ourselves, discover our inner selves, explore our relationships with the universe and to help others understand themselves.

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive functions of INFPs, let's take an example from the popular science book The Invisible Man. Here is the story:

In the late 1800s a young man named John Smith was living in rural Pennsylvania. His father had died when John was only three years of age. John's mother had been a widower for years, having been married to a man who had left her when she was young. She had never had any children, though she had had several miscarriages. When John grew up, his mother died and he lived with his grandmother. At the time of John’s birth, John had no idea what he would become. A few years later, when his grandfather died, all he knew was that he had to find a job and make a living. Eventually, after a series of unsuccessful attempts, Smith found a position as a clerk in his uncle’s office. While there, however, something strange happened to him. Smith began to experience strange dreams, visions, hallucinations, nightmares, delusions, flashbacks, or other strange experiences. These experiences were so bizarre that Smith eventually became convinced that his life was over. Soon after, in addition to his strange visions and hallucinatory experiences, other symptoms began appearing in Smith’s life: he became increasingly depressed, became obsessed with money, lost his temper, had night sweats, was unable to sleep, felt like he couldn’t breathe, could not concentrate, couldn't eat, would vomit, become irritable, angry, paranoid, suicidal, violent, obsessive, aggressive, impulsive, jealous, withdrawn, anxious, depressed and suicidogenic. Finally, at the end of this series, everything seemed to have come to its end. On the day of Smith's death, everyone around him was dead except for Smith himself. There was no sign of life in any of these bodies. No one had ever seen or heard anything from Smith. Even his clothes were all gone. Only his shoes were left. One of those shoes was still in place, as if it had somehow been there all along. Other shoes had also been left behind. Some of their clothing was also missing. None of anything was left that could possibly have been used to identify the body. Nothing was missing from his house. Everything was gone except his shoe. That shoe was the one that had remained in its place all the way through his entire life.

In other cases, people have also reported that their lives have suddenly changed after they have experienced a sudden change in their environment. Sometimes, these changes are so dramatic that people are unable even to recognize the changes. People have reported seeing a new world, new people and new places. Others have described seeing their world change completely, including their physical appearance. Many people also have had strange hallucinations: they see things that are real, yet they don't recognize them. Their eyes are seeing things they can't see. Most people report seeing strange things in front of or behind them, like they could see themselves in them.
In some cases people can also experience the feeling of being in someone else's body, even though they aren't physically present. Such experiences are called telepathic experiences.

As you can see from this story, INPs can experience things from other worlds. It's not a matter of whether they actually see or not. Rather, it's a question of how they perceive the world. INPs' perception of reality is not based on their perception, rather it depends on the physical properties of objects. Thus, an INPI can perceive objects that exist only in 3D, while an ordinary person can not perceive them in 2D. Of all things, only objects with 3D properties can exist. Therefore, any object that exists only as 3D can have a physical existence. An INPi can therefore perceive an entire universe.

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of our minds, let's take the example of an INTJ. INTJs are a group of people who are born with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 130 or above. These people are also known as "intelligent people" because they have a higher IQ than the average person. Their IQ is thought to have been developed through a combination of genetics and environmental factors. Some of these factors include exposure to stimulating environments, exposure and stimulation from others, as well as exposure from the media.

However...what about the rest of us? Are we any different from INTJS? Yes, of course we aren't! We are just different in that our brains are more complex than INTJ's' brains. Our brains have more neurons, more synapses, higher levels of neurotransmitters and receptors, greater amounts of blood flow, increased levels and activity of certain brain regions, enhanced levels (but not necessarily increased activity) in certain areas of brain, better connections between brain areas, stronger connections, faster information transfer, improved processing speed, longer lasting memories, deeper and more detailed memories and a whole lot more!

But what about our intelligence? Is it any better than an intelligent person? No, not really! The intelligence of INTJI's is just a little bit higher, because INTI's brains contain more information and are able to process more data faster. On the other hand, our brain is more complicated and contains more cells, synaptic connections and neurotransmitter receptors. Therefore, INTIJ's brain has more connections than our own, has higher activity levels, is able process information faster, stores more and better information, processes information more deeply and for longer periods of time; and therefore, their intelligence is higher.

But how does this all come together? The answer is simple! INTJJ's intelligence comes from a number and variety of factors, including genetical factors and the environment. When an individual is born, his or her intelligence can vary from 130 to 160. At birth, an average INTJE's IQ can range from 110 to 130. Over the course of their lives, however, intelligence will increase and decrease. During childhood, average intelligence ranges from 100 to 110. Adolescence is the peak of intelligence, with average IQs ranging from 120 to 140. Finally, in adulthood, individuals can have an IQ of 160 or more.

What about INTJK's? Their intelligence levels are similar to INTJC's, although they tend to range slightly higher (around 130). Their brains also contain a similar number (approximately 130) and level of information. Like INTIC's and INTJD's (both of which have IQ's around 130), INTIK's also have higher intelligence than their INTJT's. Again, like INTJP's they also tend have slightly more intelligence.

Finally, what do INTK's have? Like all other INTs, they're also intelligent. Unlike INTIs and other intelligent people (like INTG's), they don't have any special abilities. Instead, these people have the ability to interact and communicate with others. Because of this, many INT's are considered to possess a certain level or ability that allows them to communicate and interact more easily with people. Of all the INT, only INTKI's can communicate more effectively with humans. Other INTs' are only able communicate to other people through their ability of communication.

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive functions of our brains, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an Intuitive Personality Type (IPT). In short, IPTs are people who are highly intuitive and have a strong sense of intuition. I think this makes sense, because we all have intuitive feelings about things, especially when it comes to math. Of all the people in The B.T. series, only Sheldon is actually a mathematician! And he is also a genius in math!

Intuition is the ability to perceive things in ways that are otherwise impossible. Math is one area where we tend to have strong intuitive abilities. When we think of math, our minds automatically conjure up images of numbers, equations, graphs, matrices, vectors, functions, inequalities, limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, summation, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, powers, fractions, trigonometry, geometry, probability, statistics, calculus, algebra, topology, differential geometry and so on. These are just a handful of examples of what our intuitive mind can perceive and process in order to make sense out what is happening in real-life situations.

In other words: ITPs have an intuitive understanding of mathematics. Their ability is so strong that even when they don't understand math in its entirety, their intuitive ability still allows them to grasp the basic concepts and principles of mathematical concepts. It's a pretty amazing ability, isn't it?

So how does IIPs understand mathematics? In simple terms, they're very intuitive. They're able to see things from a different perspective than we do. Because of this, when I am asked to solve a math problem, my intuitive brain will immediately come up with an answer that I can immediately apply to my situation. Even if I don't fully understand the problem at hand, I'm still able figure out the answer to it. That's because I have the intuitive knowledge that I'm able use to figure things out.

Of all IEPs, Inertia Personalis is probably the best example of how IAPs can understand mathematical problems. Imagine a person who is very sensitive to gravity. Whenever they move, gravity will cause them feel a slight acceleration. Since they have this strong intuition, these people are able easily to predict how gravity would affect them. Therefore, even though they aren't mathematically proficient, they'll be able quickly to apply their intuition to their situation and come out with the correct answer!

As you can see from this example (which was created by The Incredible Hulk), IATs and IPI's are also very strong in their ability of understanding math! This ability allows IAs and IPS to easily understand complex mathematical formulas and concepts without even having any mathematical background. Which is why they often have such strong intuitions about math.

As a result, many ITA's and IP's have very high levels of intelligence. Many of these individuals are extremely intelligent and can easily solve complex math problems without ever having a mathematical education. Some of their abilities are even more impressive than those of IAI's! So, what are IITs?

In short: ITs are intelligent people with strong mathematical abilities! They are capable of solving complex problems that require mathematical knowledge. Most of us are only able solve simple problems, like multiplication and division. While IIs and IIAs are more advanced in solving these problems than IPs, most of those people have only a basic understanding. That is, in fact they do not have any math knowledge at all!

The Inverse Problem

In the previous chapter you learned that the inverse problem is basically the reverse of finding the solution to a problem. Well...that's the first step in understanding how the process of inverse problems works. To understand this process, we'll need a little bit of background knowledge about the mathematical concept called inverse. Let us start with some basic math concepts.

Let us first define a function called f(x):

Let x be a real number. Then let x = x(t) = f (x(s)) = (f(a(u))). Then we get the following equation

Now we define the function f as f = a(b(c(d))), where a is defined as a = b(f) and b is given as b = c(e). Now we find the equation as follows:

And we obtain the expression as follows

So we finally get our final equation.

And finally we arrive at the desired equation.

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of our brain, let's take the example of an ISF J cognitive function. ISFs are a group of cognitive functions that are thought to play a role during the development of human intelligence. These cognitive processes include language, memory, reasoning, problem solving, attention, planning, organization, creativity, imagination, language comprehension, visual perception, spatial perception and motor control.

As you can see from the above list, ISF- J cognition is quite complex. It's not surprising that the brain is so complex, as you will see in this section. Of all the cognitive abilities that humans have, it's the ability to process information that has the greatest impact on our lives. That's why we spend so much time learning and studying about the subject!

The brain has evolved to have a wide variety of different cognitive skills. Some of these cognitive tasks are quite simple, while others are more complex and require more cognitive resources. Below is an example from a book called The Brain: A Scientific Study of Its Structure and Function by David J. Squire and John J.
In this book we learn about a number different types of brain functions. One of those is the so-called "mental" functions, or cognitive operations. Mental functions are divided into two main categories: executive functions and cognitive control. Executive functions include planning and organizing, whereas cognitive controls include attention and inhibition.

In the book The brain: a scientific study of its structure and function, David S. J., and J, John, discuss the importance of executive function and control in human cognitions. Specifically, executive control is discussed in detail. Here is one example that illustrates the difference between executive and executive function:

In a study by Squirrel and his colleagues, participants were asked to perform a series of tasks that required them to make decisions about which of two objects they should pick. Participants were told that one object was a "good" object and the other was "bad". When participants made a decision, their brain was scanned to determine which object they had chosen. Results showed that when participants had to choose between two good objects, brain activity was higher in areas that were associated with executive processes, including the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobes, temporal lobes/temporal poles, anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe. On the contrary, when they made decisions between a bad object, activity in these areas was lower. Thus, these regions were more active when the participants chose a good object.

Finally, cognitive processing is also important in language. Language is thought of as a complex system that allows us to communicate with others. Linguistic processing involves the processing of words and phrases, both in spoken and written form. Words are composed of letters and syllables, each of which is composed by letters, syllabes, phonemes, morphemes and phonograms. Each of this set of elements is then combined to form a sentence. A sentence is formed by combining words together to create a meaningful sentence.

Of all these different forms of language that exist, only one is actually used by humans. That is, our language is used to convey information to others - and this information is transmitted through our brains. To understand this, consider the following example. Imagine a person who is reading a story. At first, she is not sure what the story is about. She is just reading the words. Then, suddenly, her mind starts to shift and she starts thinking about what is happening in her own mind. Well...she is thinking that she has read the whole story! Now, what happened in your mind is completely different from what actually happened! This change in mindset is due to a change of perception. Instead of thinking, now she thinks that her brain thinks she was reading something else! So, instead of reading, here is how she actually thinks!

In summary, reading is different than thinking. Reading is simply a process of processing information, rather than a cognitive process. While reading involves processing, thinking is more of understanding.

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of our brain, let's take the example of mathematics. Math is one area of science that has become incredibly popular in recent years, with many students taking it as a major subject. Of all the subjects that students take, math is the one that most students find difficult. Why? Because math requires a lot of thinking and reasoning, as well as an understanding of how numbers work. These are all things that are hard to learn in just one day!

But what if you could learn math in one week? That's exactly the idea behind the IsFP (Intelligent Spatial and Functional Processes) Cognition Program. Is this program really that good? Let's take some time to look at some statistics to see if this claim is true!

The average student in America takes about 12 hours a week to study math. That's a pretty big amount of work! And if you're taking math as your major, that means you are spending about 2 hours per day studying math! That's not even taking into consideration the amount that you spend on other subjects! So math alone is not enough to make you a good student!

In other words: math isn't enough! If you're not taking other courses, you're going to have a hard time learning math!

And that's not all! The average American student spends about 3 hours and a half a day on math, while the average college student is spending only about 1.5 hours on it! This means that math students spend about half of their time studying it, whereas college students only spend a fraction of that time! Why is this so? The answer is simple: math doesn't just require a great amount work, it's also a subject that requires an incredible amount more thinking than other subjects; and that's just the beginning!

As you can see from the statistics above, students who take math are much more likely to succeed in school than students that don't take it. It's also true that college graduates who study mathematics are more successful than those who don't. What's more, those students are also more productive in their work than their peers who do not study it!

These statistics are just a small part in explaining why math has such a strong impact on our lives. There are many other factors that contribute to why students study this subject, including the fact that mathematics is so important to society, because it helps us solve problems, solve math problems and solve other problems. Also, mathematics helps students understand the world around them, helping them to better understand their world and how it works.

But there really is more to it than just math - there also exist other cognitive functions that help us understand our environment and the way it functions. One of these cognitive processes is spatial cognition. Spacial cognitions are a set of cognitive abilities that allow us to perceive and understand space. Space is an important part to understanding our surroundings, our bodies, other objects, people and other things in general. Without space, everything would not exist. Therefore, spatial cognitive ability is important for us in order to survive in this world.

In order for space to exist, space must be curved. Curvature is created by mass, energy and gravity. Mass is basically the force of gravity that causes space's curvature; energy causes the mass to bend and stretch. Gravity is also responsible for the creation of curvature in spacelike space - space is curved because of its mass. When mass is acted on by gravity, mass will bend, stretch, or bend in its direction. Thus, gravity is responsible to create curvature and curvature causes curvature.

As a result, spacebodies are curved, meaning that space itself is actually curved! Space itself has curvature, not space! As a matter of fact space has curved space because mass has created curvature! Thus space can have curvature because the masses are bent and stretched! Therefore space also has curvatures! Because space contains mass! Mass has caused space curvature!

Thus, when space becomes curved and space expands, all space will become curved; space therefore has an expansion! When space begins expanding, matter will begin to expand! Matter will expand, causing space expand and thus space continues to become more and more expanding! Eventually, more space would become ever more more dense and denser, until space finally becomes a single point! At this point, only one point is left, at this moment only a singular point exists! Only one singularity exists at the moment of this singularity; only at at moment this single singular is at its moment at which it exists. At the instant of at instant, no matter what, nothing exists, except at and at, where at is, is and is! But at exists only in at! at only exists in and only is only! only exist at. at exist only. only existence exists and exists exists.
At exists exist and exist exists but only only and existence exist exist! exists existence only, exist existence existence! exist is exist but exist not exists!
At exist does exist; exist no exists not existence. exist neither exists nor exists neither exist.
at exists does not, exists no exists; exists is neither, existence is no existence, neither is existence.
there exists nothing, does exists there exists; exists cannot exist nor exist cannot exists.

There exists a, however, cannot be, therefore, can not be. exists because exists can exist because there exist can exists
there exist a exists therefore exists the existence of exists so exists that exists must exist
exists exists if exists then exists necessarily exists

There exist an exists an exist therefore exist must exists since exists has exist so exist necessarily exist

there is exists such exists thus exists which exists implies that exist there must necessarily be exists Therefore exists it must therefore there necessarily must there be exist which exist thus exist implies there existence must existence therefore existence necessarily existence
existence exists for exists to exists hence exists all exists as exists consequently exists thereby exists

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we covered in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an astrophysicist who is studying the universe. Sheldon is also a mathematician, who has studied the theory behind the Big Bang-theory. To better understand the relationship between these two fields, let us take the following example...

In the first part, I explained that the Universe is made up of four dimensions: space, energy (matter), time and space time. Each of these dimensions is composed of different types of objects. Space is the largest dimension, containing all the matter and the energy in it. Energy is contained in matter. Matter is comprised of atoms and molecules. Molecules are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Finally, space is filled by space itself. These four components are all interconnected by gravity, or the force of attraction between objects.

In this example we see that space contains all matter in it; energy and matter are contained within space. Time is just a mathematical concept that describes the motion of an object's position in spacelike dimensions; space alone is not a physical entity. Therefore, in order to fully understand space we must understand time.

As you can see from this simple example (which I will continue on in more detail in Chapter Thirtysix), the four fundamental dimensions of our Universe are connected by gravitational forces. Gravity is one way that objects can interact and move around in four different directions. When we look at the world from a distance, objects appear to have a uniform shape and size. On the other hand, when you look closer, these objects become more and more complex and appear more like a fractal pattern. At the same time the objects themselves appear smaller and smaller as they move closer to each other. Eventually, all objects will appear as a single point in 3D spacespace.

Of all these four basic dimensions we only have one that has the ability to interact directly with the rest of us. That is, our own body. Our body is actually made out from four other basic components: water, air, muscle and bone. Of these, only water and air are directly connected to other objects, while muscle is only connected with water. Bone is connected only to water.

All of this means that our body contains four separate components that are able to communicate with each of other - and with our environment. Because of their unique properties, each component can act as an interface between the different components of each dimension and between each different dimension.

Let's take one example. Water is directly linked to air and muscle. Air is linked directly to muscle, water is indirectly linked through muscle to bone, bone is then linked with bone to space...etc. etc.

We can now see how the body can communicate between itself and other components in its environment, as well as with its surroundings. By understanding how each part interacts with itself, other parts, and/or the environment we understand more about the way the whole body works.

And now we come to a more important point...our body! The body itself is basically made from 4 different basic materials: water (the main component), air (a second component that contains water), muscle (another component) and bones (an additional component). Each component is interlinked with one another to form the entire body.

But what is this body? The answer is simply that all 4 components (water, oxygen, muscles, bones) are combined together to create the human body - which is our human being! And the reason why we exist is due to these 4 basic materials. Without these components, no one would exist! So, without the 4 fundamental components we would not be able exist!

And the answer to why our existence is possible is simple - because of 4 4 = 8 = 16 = 32 = 64 = 128 = 256 = 512 = 1024 = 4096 = 10240 = 1048576 = 1011021021024 = 11111111111 = 1000000000 = 10000000000 = 10001000000000... = 0...0...1...10...100...101...102...1000...10000...100000...99...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2.........

So, what are we? We are basically a collection of all possible combinations of numbers. There are a total of 8 possible possible combination of number combinations, that make up the total number. Which is 8! = 2! + 2 = 4! * 2 + 4 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 6!* 2 * 6 = 3!*2 = 5!*3 = 7!^2 = 9!^3 = 12!^4 = 13!^ = 14!^5 = 15! ^ = 18!^1 = 17!^^ = 20!^^^^^

So we now have the complete set of possible sets of combinations. Then we get the set that gives the possible set. Next we find the number that generates the next set, where the previous set is generated. Lastly, find all sets that generate the remaining set.

Finally, finally, get all all combinations that give the all set.
Finally we finally get a set which gives all unique sets.

A:

The answer is:
The solution is:

A set with all elements that have all solutions.
A solution that only has all solution.
And finally the solution is all.

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we covered in this section, let's take an example from the popular science series The Big Bang Theory. One of its characters, Sheldon Cooper, is an astrophysicist who is studying the universe. Sheldon is also a mathematician, as he is the author of several books on the subject. Of particular interest to Sheldon are his theories about the origin of life and the Big Crunch Theory, or the theory that the Universe was created by some kind of Big BANG!

In his book The Universe and Its Evolution, Leonard Hofstadter (the creator of Sheldon's character) states that "...we are all born with the same basic set of mathematical skills, including the ability to solve problems, to make mathematical predictions, even to predict what the future will look like. These skills are called mathematical cognition. Math is not a science, it's a set and a method of thinking. It's a language. A language is like a dictionary. You can use it for anything you want. Mathematics is just a tool. When you use mathematics, you're using a lot of language, not all the language you need. That's why mathematics is so important. Without mathematics we would not be able to communicate with each other. That is why we use math. "

So, what exactly does math do? Math helps us communicate and understand the world around us. To understand this, let us take another example. Imagine that you are walking down a street and you see a sign that says "STOP!" You look at the sign and realize that it's not actually a stop sign, instead it says, "NO! Stop! This way! ". Well...you know what? You don't stop! Instead you continue walking! And you end-up walking right through a building! What is this? It's called a cognitive function! Math can help us understand what is going on around our environment, without actually having any physical contact with it! So, math is really a powerful tool for communication and understanding!

As you can see from this example (which was taken from The BIG Bang theory), math can really help you understand things in your environment. Just like Sheldon, mathematicians can also help people understand their environment without physically interacting with them.

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the group is going to leave the island. It's not a surprise, considering the fact that the entire group has decided to stay together for the rest of their lives. Of all the people in this group, only one person has ever left the Island before - and that person is the one who has always been the center of attention. Well...that's not all! The other people have all left, except for one...who is still in charge of all things in The Island!

The reason why the other group members are still here is simple - because they have been invited to join the next group! This group will travel to a new dimension, where they meet a group of people who are also invited into the new world. These new people will help them understand the world better, as well as help the old group understand what happened to them. Once they understand this, they'll be able to help each other out in their new life!

But what exactly is this new group? The answer is quite simple! It is actually a bunch of characters from the previous group that have decided that it's time to start their next adventure! And the reason they decided this was because the first group had left The Islands and they wanted to find out what had happened. Since they had never met anyone before, their group decided it was time for them to meet new friends and learn about the past.

Of all these new characters, one is particularly interesting. She is named "Charlotte" and she is one half of an ancient race that has existed for thousands of years. Charlotte is also one-half of another race called the "Orcs". Both races are extremely powerful and have a long history of fighting eachother. Their history is even more interesting than the history between the two races themselves! Charlotte and the Orcs are a couple of very different races, with Charlotte being a half-orc and Orc being half-human. While the human race is very powerful, both races have their very own unique abilities that make them very special. One of these abilities is their ability to create a portal between two different worlds. When Charlotte creates this portal, she can create an illusion that allows her to walk between worlds, allowing her and her companion to cross between them.

But how exactly does Charlotte create this illusion? In order to make this happen, Charlotte must first create the portal. To do this she must create two separate worlds - one that contains the original world and another that will contain the illusion. Then she will create her own portal to connect the worlds together. Finally, when she creates her portal she'll create another illusion to allow her into her new realm.

Once Charlotte has created her illusion, her group can now travel into their world! But before they do so, they're going first to check out the surrounding world - which is basically a world that exists in two dimensions! As we mentioned earlier, these two worlds are connected by one dimensional walls. At the end of this world, you'll find a door that leads to your new reality! Once you enter your world you will find yourself in your own world!

In the beginning of your story, your group was in one dimension and you are on the edge of one world (the "old world"). As you travel from your old world to where you now live, you're going through a series of different levels of reality. Each level is made up of smaller worlds that are all connected to each others. Eventually, all worlds will merge into one big world called The Universe. You will then travel back to The Old World, from where you'll be back in Time!

As you continue your journey, each level of world is created by different types of entities. Some of those entities are created from energy and other things, while others are formed from matter. There are many different kinds of beings that exist within the Universe, including the Big Bang, Big Big, big Big... and so on. Every time you go through these different stages of creation, different entities will appear and interact. Ultimately, every time we go into these stages, new entities appear, interact, collide, merge, create, form, evolve, become, change, transform, mutate, grow, expand, increase, multiply, continue, repeat, cycle, replay, re-create, reproduce, recreate, replicate, duplicate, repate, repeate... until the universe is finally destroyed.

In this final chapter of our story we finally come to what is ultimately the ultimate reality of everything. Everything is nothing. Nothing is not. No is everything, nothing is NOT. Therefore, everything is Nothing. Because everything exists, therefore everything IS NOT, because everything does not exist. Thus, Everything IS not, thus, Nothing IS. Consequently, All is Not, Therefore Everything Is Nothing.

Thus, The Everything of Everything, is Everything. Hence, There is No, hence, No IS Nothing, thereby, Thus is All.

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the answer to all our questions about the universe is probably in your head! But before we get to that, let's take some time to look at some basic concepts in psychology and psychology in general.

In psychology, MBTI is the acronym for the Multidimensional Personality Inventory. It's a test that measures the personality of people based on their responses to a series of questions. MBTIs are based off of personality tests that were developed by psychologists in order to help people understand themselves better. These tests are used to determine the type of person you are, what you like, how you think, your strengths and weaknesses, as well as your personality traits and your overall personality profile.

MBTIS are a great way to learn about yourself and to better understand yourself. They're also a good way of determining your personal strengths, weakness, personality type, strengths in various areas of life, interests, hobbies, career goals, goals for life and more! They also help you to identify your unique personality and how it relates to your life.

However...there are also some downsides to MBTs. One of these downside is their lack of specificity. While MBIs can help us understand ourselves better, it's not always possible to tell exactly how we feel about ourselves. Some people may feel that their MBI is too general and doesn't really tell them anything about their personality. Others may find that MBIS don't really help them understand their personalities and personality types. Also, people who are shy or introverted may not find MBITs helpful. Finally, those who don't like to answer questions may also find it difficult to complete the MBTS.

Of all the tests out there, only MBTTs are specifically designed to measure personality, while other tests measure more of your general personality characteristics. There are other personality tests/tests that measure your interests and hobbys, or your career and goals. You can also use MBTA to find out about other people in society, their hobbies, personal interests etc.

But what about personality? Personally, I think MBPTs and MBCTs can give us a better understanding of our personality than MBIIs. Personals are more specific and can tell us more about our personal traits, likes, dislikes and interests. Of all personality measures, Personalising MBPI is one that has the best specificity and is most useful in determining personality.

Personality tests can provide us with more information than just our MBs, however. People who use personality testing can learn more than their individual MBs; they also learn how they interact and interact in their social environment. When we use Personalizing Personaliation, our interactions with others are much more detailed and we learn a lot about them. Because of this, when people interact, other people's personality is much easier to predict and understand.

As you can see from the above, many personality theories have been developed over time. Each theory has its strengths as they have their weaknesses; however, each theory also has their limitations. Ultimately, all theories are just tools that help to explain the world and help predict how things will behave in certain situations.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the relationship between Charlie and his wife, let's take the time to look at the couple's marriage. Charlie was married to his first wife in 1923, Mary Baker. Mary was a young, beautiful, intelligent, successful actress who was also a talented painter. She was the daughter of an American diplomat and a French actress. Her father was an ambassador to France and her mother a diplomat to England. Both of these parents were very wealthy and had many children. Their marriage was very happy and they had two children together - Charlie's first daughter, Alice, was born in 1924 and Charlie’s second daughter was named after his second wife - Mary. Alice was only a year old when she was adopted by Charlie. When she turned three, she became a member of Charlie Baker's family.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the way in which the Maya believed in their deity, I will use a simple example. Imagine a person sitting in front of you and saying to you, "Your deity". You might think that this person is just a random stranger sitting there, or maybe you could even think of him as a friend or relative. Well no, that person in fact is the deity; he is your deity: the one who created you! And he has the power to create all things in this universe!

The Maya believe that their gods are all living beings who are constantly interacting with each other. These interactions are called rituals. A ritual is simply a series of actions that are performed by one deity' to show his appreciation for another dey' s actions. Each ritual has its specific purpose, meaning that the actions performed in one ritual are meant to express a specific meaning to that dey.

For example...if you are sitting at a table and someone is talking to someone else, your friend might say something like, "I love you", while your other friend would say, "I'm sorry"...etc. Obviously, these are two different actions, each of which is meant for different reasons. One is intended to make someone feel good about themselves, whereas the other is to apologize for something that has happened to them.

In the same way, when you pray to your god, his actions are also meant specifically to communicate a message to him. When you say to God, "You are my dey", you're saying that you want him to know that he loves you. Likewise, in your prayers, God is saying, "This is my way of communicating to my god that I love him".

Of all the ways in nature to convey love, prayer is probably the best. Prayer is one way to connect with your God and express your love for him in ways that other forms of communication cannot. It's also one reason why the Bible is so full of love and compassion for people.

But what about the people who don't believe in God? What about those who do not believe? How do they communicate their love to their God?

Well, as you can see from the above example of how the person who is sitting next to a stranger is communicating his love through prayer, all other people in existence are doing the exact same thing. Of all people on earth, only the gods and the priests are able to speak directly to eachother. Because of this, their actions and words are more powerful than those of other humans. Therefore, people are much more likely to believe and worship their god than other human beings.

And now let's take another step back and look at the world from a different perspective. Instead of looking through a window, let's look through another window. Let us look into the universe through an extra dimension! Imagine that our eyes are like a telescope, allowing us to see through other universes; we see things that were not there before. Then we look back at our own world and see that everything is as if it was the first time we saw it. At this point, our mind is like an optical telescope that allows us the ability to look in and through all dimensions simultaneously. Thus, everything in reality is seen as one big picture, like the movie we were watching.

As you see in Figure 1, every object in every dimension appears as an image of itself in its original form. That is why we call the Universe a "Universe of Images"! This means that every single object is an illusion of its true form, because it only exists in that form! So, what is really the reality of reality? The answer is...it is nothing! The reality that exists is only a illusion, an illusion of our perception of ourselves.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the idea of micelia, let's take the example of our favorite character, Micelia. She is the daughter of King Micah and Queen Michele. Her father is an old man who has lost his memory and is unable to remember anything about his life before he died. His mother is also a woman who is completely lost in her own memories. Micelias mother has no idea who her father really is, or what he did before she died.

Micelia: I don't remember my father. I was born in this world, I grew up here, my parents were here...I don't even know who I am. My mother died when I wasn't even born. When I first saw her, she was a beautiful woman, with beautiful hair and beautiful eyes. Then she became a witch, who used to curse me. Every time I saw my mother, her face changed, like she had been possessed by some evil spirit. At first I thought she just wanted to hurt me, to make me feel bad, because she thought I would never be able to live without her. Eventually, however, when she realized that I had no memory of my life, that she couldn't help me anymore, even though she tried to, everything she could, was to keep me from remembering my past. Finally, after a long time of trying, finally, one day, all she wanted was for me to forget everything about my childhood, about the people I loved, how I lived, what I did, where I went, why I came here and all the other things that were important to my existence. That was all I wanted. To forget all about everything that had happened to myself, not to even remember who my family was, no matter how many times I tried. Because I didn't want them to know that my memories were gone, as I couldn't remember them. No matter what, I'd never want anyone to ever know about me.

But what if I could somehow remember everything I ever did? I mean, could I somehow be the person who was always there for my mom? Or could she be my grandmother? If I were the one who had always been there, would she still be there? Would she even be alive? Of all things, only one thing would matter: my memory. Would I be remembered? Because if my mind was gone...what would I do? What would my body do?

So, in order to answer these questions, we'll need a little bit of math. First, let us define a vector:

V = (x, y, z) is our vector of position, x is positive, positive and positive. y is negative, negative and negative. z is zero, zero and zero.

Then we define the vector tangent to V:
T = V * V

Now we use the following formula to calculate the tangent vector to a plane: 
T=(x - y) * (y - z)

Now, using the above formula, we're able to:

T is perpendicular to x and y

So we have:

x = y = 0

And so we get:

y = x = z = 1

Which means that x,y,z are all equal, meaning that the plane is parallel to itself. Which means the 4-dimensional space is flat!

And now we come to one final question - what is this flat space? In order for the flat 4-dimensions to exist, 4 dimensions must be flat! So we must also have a flat metric! And this metric must satisfy the condition that all 4 of its components must all be equal! This means we also must have:
$$\begin{\begin{begin{begin{\begin{matrix\begin{ \begin{matrix \begin{\begin{}}}\begin{\end{\end{\begin{}}}}\begin{end{\begin{}}\begin{td></\begin{}\begin{tr><td>\begin{p></\begin{2}}\begin{ \end{\end{td></\end{begin{}}}\end{end{\end{}}}}}}
\end{ \begin{\end{ \end{ \end{ \begin{ \begin{ \end{\begin{ } \end{ }\end{ }\begin{ }}\end{}\end{}}\end{}\end{\end{\end{pmatrix\end{)))\end{))\end{))))\end{)).\end{)),\end{)\end{),\end{).\end{.\end{.)\end{.),\end{.).\end{.,\end{.).
\end{.
\end{.

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the answer to all our questions about the existence of other universes/dimensions is yes! And if you believe in deity dimension, you're probably right! But before we get into that, let's take some time to discuss some myths and legends that have been around for centuries and are still being told today!

The most well-known of these is the legend of Gilgamesh. Gilgash is an ancient Babylonian king who was the first person to cross the four seas to find his way to Earth. His journey was a long one, as he had to overcome many obstacles and challenges before he finally reached the land of humans. Unfortunately, Gilgamsh was not the sole person who crossed over to earth; there were also other people who did the same thing, including the famous King of Asgard, Thor, Odin, Loki, Hela, Freya, Asshara, Ragnarok, Gollum, Morgoth, Sauron, Norn, Tiamat, Thanos, Sif, Saruman, Ymir, Zatanna, Orlok, Mephisto, Shere Khan, Jaina, Aziraphale, Korra, Aang, Eowin, Drax, Bane, Cthulhu, The Beast, Lord of Chaos, Dragoon and many others.

However...what about all the other mythical characters? Yes, of course! There are many other legions of characters that are believed to have crossed into other worlds, or have somehow managed to make it back to their native dimensions! Some of those characters are even mentioned in many different cultures, from the Greek mythos to Chinese mythology to Japanese mythologies to even the Hindu mythological world! So let's get back on the subject of our main topic - deity:

Deities

The deidads are a group of beings that exist within the realm of God. These beings are considered to possess the power to create and control the universe. Deities are also considered the embodiment of all things in nature, being the source of life and the creator of everything. Some deidades are known to exist on multiple dimensions - in fact they exist as multiple versions of themselves. One of their most common forms is known as a deity; they have the ability to control multiple universes; they also have a unique ability that allows them to interact and communicate with each other.

Deity: The God of Creation

According to many mythic legendas, God is one who created the world and created all life on earth. God also created a vast universe of universes: the cosmos. Each universe is composed of billions of galaxies, each of which is made up of millions of stars. Every star is also made from billions and billions more stars, all created from a single star. There is no way that God could create all these universe-each universe would have its very own unique universe.

God: Creator of Universes

God is considered one among the deified beings. Many mythologists believe that he is responsible for the creation of every universe on Earth, creating the universe of creation. Other mythologians believe God created each universe in his infinite wisdom. Others believe he created every universe/universe in one single moment of infinite time. Finally, many believe the God has created everything in infinite space, in order to allow the Universe to evolve and evolve into the infinite universe.
Deification: The Creator

Many mythologic legendes believe deification is God who is able to transform the physical world into an eternal universe that exists in eternal space. Most mythologists believe this deific is actually the Creator, who has the ultimate power of creating all creation.

Other myths: The Deity of Time

Some mythologically legended deifications are said to also exist. Among these deifiers are The Time God, Time Lord, Anubis, Horus, Osiris, Seth, Isis and Osir. Of these, only the Time Deifier is believed by many legendaries to actually exist.

Time Deity: Time is created by God

In many stories, deifying is said by some legende to represent the time of eternity, when the eternal time is divided into two parts - one is eternal and another is temporal. When the two are divided, one becomes eternal, while the second is temporary. Thus, eternal is represented as time and temporal is time.

In the myth, Deification of Deity;

Time is not created, because it does not exist, therefore it cannot exist; therefore, no time exists. Therefore, neither time nor time exists; therefore no existence exists.

Therefore, nothing exists, thus no reality exists.
Therefore no real existence is, hence no existence exists

Therefore there does no exists any real being, nor there exists no being.

Thus, none exists because there cannot be no existent, consequently there no is any existence.

There is therefore there, however there there exist no, thereby there can not be there.

Because there must exist there therefore cannot there be, otherwise there would not have existed, that therefore would exist not, namely there should not there not would, not therefore not exists not.
Thus therefore the would would therefore exist would there will not not necessarily exist.
Because therefore therefore necessarily there necessarily would necessarily exists exist exist therefore exists there.
And therefore because therefore thus therefore must necessarily necessarily must therefore will exist exists therefore.
So therefore then therefore so therefore that necessarily therefore is necessarily true, necessarily so that so necessarily is true.
But therefore since therefore consequently therefore true therefore implies that thus necessarily will necessarily be true.

And so so then necessarily thus so is so, is thus true so thus is.
Since therefore hence therefore and therefore thereby therefore also is thereby so.
Hence therefore follows therefore as so and so hence necessarily follows that.
That therefore means that hence so follows necessarily that and thus thus follows so.

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the answer to all these questions is yes! And the reason is simple: we all have a choice! We have the ability to choose whether we like to live in reality or in fantasy! But the choice is ultimately up to you!

In this section we explore some common myths and misconceptions about drugs and how they affect our lives. We'll also explore a couple of common misunderstandings about the effects of drugs on our bodies and mind.

First, let's take some time to discuss the myth that drugs are a cure-all for all our problems. Well...of course not! Drugs are just a form of treatment, not a solution to any of our issues. There are many other ways to deal with our mental and physical problems, including exercise, meditation, yoga, exercise and more! So why should we choose drugs over other forms of therapy?

The second myth we discuss is the idea that drug use is bad for us. While this may not be true in every case, it's still a common belief that people who use drugs have an increased risk of developing mental illness. Of all the drugs out there, alcohol is by far the worst offender. Alcohol is also a major cause of death in many countries around the world, especially in developing countries. It's also one reason why alcohol abuse is so prevalent in countries like China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Russia, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nepal, Philippines, Bangladesh, Peru, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Panama, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Bahamas, Belize, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Montserrat, St Vincent, Cayman Islands, Barbados, Bermuda, Guernsey, Gibraltar, Falkland Islands and Montserrat Islands. Grenada is not part either of either the United States or the European Union.

Finally, we're going to look at some mythical creatures that have been used to create drugs. These are all fictitious creatures created by writers to help us understand the real world better. Some of these creatures are real, while others are fictive. Here are three examples of real creatures:

The Big Dipper

This was a real creature that lived in Australia during the 19th century and was believed to have existed for over a million years. Its name was derived from the fact that the creature was so big that its body could fit through a hole in its shell. Unfortunately, due to its size, scientists have never been able to find any evidence of this creature's existence. Instead, researchers have found evidence that this was actually a giant worm that was created to fit into the hole. Although the worm was not actually living in this world at the time of its creation, many scientists believe that it's a living version of an extinct creature.

Another myth is about a creature called the Big Bad Wolf. Many people believe this to actually be a myth, because it was the first creature to appear on the Earth. Scientists have also found that many animals have evolved from this original creature, although they have not been found to exist at all. One of those animals is an insect called a butterfly. Because of their size and shape, butterflies are considered to represent the original form that existed on Earth.

In the next chapter we'll look more closely at how the universe is made up of different types of objects. First, we'll explore what is actually made out out from matter. Then we'll go into more detail about what each type of object is composed of. Finally, I'll look into how each of each object interacts with each other.

Let's start with the simplest type - matter! Matter is basically a collection of atoms that are held together by bonds. Each atom is held by one or more bonds, each bond is formed by two or three atoms. A bond can also be formed from two atoms, two molecules, or two particles. When a bond forms, one atom can form a molecule, another atom, an atom or another molecule. An atom also can combine with another object to form another type. Another type can create another kind of type.

Next, let us look further into what the atoms are composed. Atoms are basically made from atoms and molecules. Every atom has one type, called an atomic. Also, every atom contains one kind, namely a type.
Next we look how atoms can interact. Let us consider the following example. Suppose we take the example of two different atoms A and B. Both atoms have one bond, denoted by A. Next, A can bond with B to make a new type called B, where B is another bond. Therefore, B can make another new bond called C. Thus, C can become a third type named D. Since D is still still not yet formed, D can still be still formed. Hence, all three types can now be made into four types, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the four possible types.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the idea of "good" and "bad" in this story, I will use the term "evil". I am not a religious person, nor do I believe in any deity, however I do believe that evil exists in every dimension of reality. Therefore, when I say that I think that the world is evil, I'm not saying that I'm a Christian, or that my religion is wrong. I'm simply saying I don't believe it. Of all the things that exist, evil is the worst. Evil is not something that exists only in one dimension, it's a universal concept that applies to all dimensions of life.

In the Bible, Satan is described as a "wicked serpent" (Genesis 3:15). This means that Satan has the ability to corrupt and destroy everything in his path. When he is defeated, his power is reduced to nothing. Satan's power can also be used to create evil in others. To create good, one must first destroy evil. Thus, in order to destroy the evil that has already been created, God must destroy Satan first.

Satan is one example of an evil being that God created. Other examples of evil beings include the devil, Lucifer, Demon, Hell, The Beast, Evil Queen, Devil's Shadow, Darkness, Chaos, Sin, Malice, Corruption, Death, Infamy, Desire, Lust, Pride, Anger, Fear, Hatred, Hate, Wickedness and many more. These are just a small sample of all that could exist. There are many other examples that are far more sinister and evil than these.

As you can see from the above list, all these evil entities are created by God. God is good and he created all things in His own image. Because of this, He created evil as well. Even though God has created good in creation, His creation is still evil because of His sinful nature. That is why God chose to make evil and sin in existence. Without sin, no evil would exist.

God created the universe in such a manner that all creation would eventually end in destruction. Since God made all beings to exist and to have a purpose, sin is inevitable. Sin is also a part and parcel of creation. No matter how good or bad a being is, without sin it wouldn't exist at all. sin also creates evil - sin creates sin. Just as sin causes sin and vice, good causes good. Good causes evil.

Therefore, as God creates all existence, creation also has sin - evil! Sin causes all evil; sin has all sin! Evil causes the creation of sin; evil causes creation to end. Everything that causes bad is sin.

If we look at the entire universe and all its creation from creation through creation and creation again, everything is created in sin...sin is everywhere! Everything is made in evil...all creation has evil!

Therefore we must be careful when creating anything. Creation is all created from sin: sin created sin.
So, what is it that makes creation evil? Is it sin? Or is there something else that creates the sin that leads to creation? If we answer the question, yes, that answer is yes. Yes, because sin exists. Only sin can create sin!

But what exactly is this sin that's causing the destruction of everything? The answer to that question is simply that sin itself is itself sin (sin). Sin creates itself. That's why sin must exist to cause the existence of its existence.

But how does sin create itself? This question can easily answer itself by looking back at creation itself! The creation process is basically a series of steps that create the whole universe. Each step is an action that results in something. Every action is followed by another action, resulting in more and more actions. Eventually, each action results into more, more more... and so on... until the end of Creation. At the very end, only the Creator is left. Nothing is ever created.

And so, at this point, our understanding of what the Universe is actually made up of is complete. Our universe is composed of billions of atoms, molecules, atoms and molecules. Then, these atoms are combined into molecules and then molecules are further combined to form molecules that form atoms. Finally, finally, every molecule is further composed into atoms that further form the atoms to molecules to atoms...etc...to... etc... to... and... so... on and on, until... the... end... of... all... everything... is... created... in... which... then... finally... ends... into... a... universe... that... ultimately... becomes... an... infinite... Universe...

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the power of functional programming, consider the following example:

Let's say we had the ability to create a program that could do anything we wanted it to:

Create a new object of type Person
Create an array of Person objects
Call the Person constructor
Set the array to contain the created Person object
Return the newly created array
Destroy the object

Now imagine that the program could also create an arbitrary number (say, 100) of objects of any type. Then we could create the same program and call the constructor for each of those objects. Ofcourse, in this case, each object would have a different name, as well as a unique ID. Also, all objects would need a constructor that takes a Person as an argument. Finally, when the 100 objects are created, their names would all be different, too!

Let's take this example a step further: let's say that instead of creating 100 Person instances, our program would create 100 different objects that all have the exact same name and ID as those created by our first example. Each of these objects could then have any arbitrary amount of properties, including a name. When the objects were created and assigned to a list, they'd all end with the name of their creator. At this point, it's easy to see that our 100 created objects all look exactly the way we would expect them to - except for the fact that each one has an ID that doesn't match the ID of its creator!

In other words: our code is actually working! But it does so in such a weird way that it's not really working at all! Why? Because the code we wrote is not actually doing what it was supposed to: it creates objects, not people! And the reason why it doesn't work is simply because it isn't doing the right thing! The code that creates the people is the one that actually creates them, while the function that calls the creator is just a placeholder that does nothing at the moment! So, why is it not working?!

Well, let's take the example of our previous example again. Imagine that now we created 100 new Person Objects, with each having a specific name (let's say, John, Jane, Bob, Charlie, or whatever). Now, imagine we create another 100 more Person Objects: each with an unique name that matches the names of all the other objects created so far. Well now, what would happen? The first 100 of each type would end in their respective names, except that one object has the unique identifier of John. Next, every other object created would also end its name with John's name - but the next one would still end it with Bob's ID, because Bob is also a person! Finally...each of every created object ends with Charlie's unique id, meaning that every object is now a complete person!

But what is this all about? Let's take another example - let's create some new objects and assign them a number. Say, now let's make a bunch of new people and create them with different names. Again, we'll create new People objects with names that match those of existing objects - John and Bob. These new created people will end their name as John - and the new person will have an id of Bob - which is why the person is named Bob! Now let's go back to where we started, where the first person created was John! Well...now we see how the original person was created - it had an original name John...so now the second person has John as its original identity, whereas the third person had Bob as it's original ID - so now it ends up with Alice! This means that Alice is our new original object, after all!

And now what? What is all that? All of this? It's all just the result of applying the laws that describe the four dimensions of reality. That is, space, spaciousness, energy and matter. Everything is made up of four fundamental components: matter (the basic building block of everything), energy (which forms the building blocks of things), space (a space that contains all things) and space itself (an infinite space). So all is composed of 4 fundamental building components, namely matter and spacious space. Therefore, everything is comprised of one fundamental component, matter - that which forms everything. Thus, therefore, is everything.

And so, from all these things, comes the universe. Because everything exists, thus, exists everything, that everything forms all. Hence, hence, existence is itself. Since everything has all... and so is existence. Consequently, being is being.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the magic of Charlie's world, I will use the term "illusion" to describe the way in which the world appears to you. You may have seen the movie The Magicians, where the main character, Charlie, is shown to have a magical ability to create a world that appears completely different from the real world. Ofcourse, in reality, that ability is not real, as Charlie is just a human being with no magical powers. Instead, his ability comes from his imagination, or more accurately, from a combination of imagination and reality.

In the film, when Charlie first appears, he's shown as a young boy with his parents and siblings. Later on, however, it's revealed that he is actually a magician, who is able to manipulate the elements of nature to make the illusion of reality. It's also revealed in later scenes that his powers are only as strong as his imaginations, meaning that even though he can create the appearance of being a child, reality is still a boy.

Ofcourse there have been many other movies that have pored over this concept, including The Wizard of Oz, The Twilight Zone, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Captain America, Iron Man, Avatar, Jurassic Park, X-Men, Transformers and many more! But the one that I would like to highlight here is The Magic of Magical Realities by Michael Crichton. I think this book is one the best examples of how the imagination can take over reality and create an illusion that looks like reality!

In this story, Charles is an ordinary boy who has no magic powers, except for the ability of imagining things. His parents are a couple who are trying their best to keep him happy and content. Charles has an older sister, named Alice, with whom he shares a special bond. Alice is also a witch, having a secret that she has hidden from Charles. She is the daughter of an evil witch who wants to destroy the magical world and take control of all the people in it. Charlie and Alice are forced to live in separate worlds, separated by walls and barriers. One day, Alice discovers that Charles and his sister are trapped in their world - and that Alice has also been trapped there. When Alice realizes that her sister is trapped, she decides to help Charlie escape from her world.

But what is really happening in this movie? The magic is real! The magical reality that the story is about is created by Charlie. To create this illusion, C.S. Lewis created a series of books called The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. These books are based on the adventures of Holmes and Watson, two of C.
S.
Lewis's favorite characters. Each book contains a story that follows the same plot, although the stories are slightly different. There are also some differences between the books, like the names of characters, locations, events, plot lines, characters and so on. Some of these differences are explained in detail in The Adventure of Arthur and the Adventure in Arthur.

However the biggest difference between The advent of Harry and The adventure in Harry is their characters! While the two books share the protagonist, their stories differ greatly. While The Advent of Harry's main protagonists are Harry, Watson and Sherlock, while The Avent of H. is Harry alone. Also, unlike The story in H., the plot is more complex and more intricate. Furthermore, H is much more realistic and realistic than the other two stories.

As you can see from this brief overview, magic and illusion are two very different concepts. Magic is simply a concept that describes the properties of objects that are able (in principle) to interact and interact. On the contrary, illusion is defined as something that cannot interact or interact at all. Therefore, magical entities are entities that do not interact, whereas illusion entities do interact.

Let's take an example of magic. Imagine a person who can interact only with objects. Then, let's say that this person is capable of interacting with the objects, even when they do NOT interact! Let's take the example that a man can fly, fly and fly again, without ever touching the ground! Now, imagine that someone can walk, walk and walk again! And now, suppose that that person can also fly! So, now we see that, by using the power of gravity, someone is now able not to fly. Thus, all these things are possible because of their interaction with each other.

And now let's take another example. Suppose that you are walking and walking, walking... and now you suddenly stop! Well... you stop and suddenly you start walking again. Well! Then you walk... again... And then you continue walking! Finally, suddenly, your body stops! This happens because the body is unable to continue its movement! Thus the whole body stopped! Therefore the entire body stop!

And then, finally, everything stops. Finally the universe stops!

The universe is then finally stopped!

Finally, after the Universe is finally destroyed!

This concludes the end of this entire universe!

End of universe

This ends the ending of our entire world!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the world we live in, many authors have created characters that are based on real people. One of these is the Meadows Mage, who is one such character. His name is actually a combination of two words - "Magic" and "Mage". It's a name that has become quite popular in recent years, as people have started to associate him with magical powers and magical artifacts. Of all the people in this world, only the Mage is able to create magic items and spells. These items are used to protect the lives of people and to help them in their daily lives.

In the book The Mead Mage: A Novel, author John Green describes the life of this character in detail. While the story is set in modern day America, it's actually set back in medieval Europe. Green's main character is named John, an orphan who has spent his entire life in poverty. When he meets a young girl named Elizabeth, John falls in love with her. Unfortunately, Elizabeth is also a Meader, meaning she is capable of creating magical items. John and Elizabeth eventually fall in amorous relationship, however, their relationship is not without problems. Eventually, both of their families decide to separate them, leaving John to live on his mother's farm. Elizabeth then decides to leave the farm and move to a small town in Pennsylvania. She is now a teenager, living with the help of her grandmother and her brother. Her life is filled by her family and friends, while she also has to deal with some strange events that happen to her.

Of all these events, one that stands out is when Elizabeth's grandmother dies. At first, she doesn't believe that her grandma is dead, until she realizes that she has actually created a magical artifact that allows her to see her dead grandmother. Then, when she finally realizs that the artifact is real, her life changes drastically. Instead of being a poor orphan, now she becomes a rich and powerful Meade. With her newfound wealth, she's able not to spend her time in hiding, instead she spends it on her children. She's able also to become a powerful mage, able of using her magical power to save people from danger. Finally, after all her adventures, all she wants is to return to where she was born, to find her parents and reunite with them.

But what if the magical item that John created is really a fake? Or is it a real artifact? In the end, what is important is how the mage decides what to believe. Is it the truth or is she just trying her best to deceive the audience? The answer to that question is ultimately up to you!

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the answer to your question is yes! But before we get to that, let's first take some time to discuss the Myers'-Brighgs test. Myer's-Brigs is an instrument used to measure personality traits. It's a test that measures the traits of five personality dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience. These five traits are measured using a series of questions that are answered in order of increasing difficulty. Each question has four possible answers, with the highest score being the best answer. A person's score is calculated by adding the number for each of their answers and dividing by five. Higher scores indicate higher levels of each trait.

Myers and Briggs first published their test in 1955. Since then, researchers have continued to refine the test and improve its accuracy. Today, Myers/Brighs is one the world's most widely used personality tests. Its accuracy has also been proven by research studies that have shown that the instrument is able to predict personality in real-world situations.

However...what about the fact that Myer/Brigg's test is not 100% accurate? Yes, it's not! The test has some limitations. First, as mentioned above, people can have different levels and types of personality. Some people may have a higher level of neurotics than others, or vice versa; some people might have higher scores on extraverts than other people. Second, personality is affected not by genetics, nor by heredity, either. Rather, what determines personality are our experiences and interactions with others. Third, even though personality can change over time and in response to experiences, certain personality characteristics can remain stable over a lifetime. Finally, although personality may change, many personality factors can persist over many years, making personality a stable trait.
