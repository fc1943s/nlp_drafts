## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the universe is made up of matter, and space-time is just the fabric of space and time that forms the fabric of our 3+1 dimensional universe. A deity is defined as being either a physical entity or a non-physical entity created by another entity. Physical entities, like atoms, are composed of elements (such as hydrogen, oxygen, and the fittest lithium), while non-physical entities are composed of something called an energy-matter "box". Energy-matter "box" is made up of free particles, similar to a bunch of air balls in your hand. These energy-matter "box" particles can literally move around the "box" very independently of other particles, so the "box" is not only defined by the "energy" or "mass" of the particles in it, but also by their location in space and time.

Things just seem a lot more interesting when we consider our 3+1 dimensional universe to be a 'box' of energy-matter particles in a huge endless "space" of freely moving particles. We can't seem to grasp how seemingly random nature can have the power to create so many monstrous creatures of terrifying strength that run over their masters with seemingly unstoppable speed. Let's take a look at Balenciaga's shoes, a piece of clothing that was designed by one of the world's most famous designers, Thierry Mugler.

Disclaimer: A good deal of the visuals in this chapter were taken from Wikipedia. The context here is to provide an overview of what Balenciaga means to us - it is a brand that, in some ways, has become synonymous with luxury fashion and the look and feel of French cuisine.

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the reason we create categories is to help us describe and classify things more clearly. In a nutshell, when we encounter a new phenomenon, we have to categorize it by defining a particular category that best describes what is being described - in this case, the phenomenon of monster driving kids off their skids!

Let's take our time next to recap the story we were reading earlier in Chapter 30.  At this point, Kyle and Learisa are about to get hit by a truck, and Learisa is facing her own monster driving her off her skid.  Learisa is skimming through a shoe-box filled with screamers in hopes that she might be able to find Kyle - for these kids, riding around in an enclosed box is a kind of ritual to bring good luck into the next day, so Learisa thinks that it would be nice if Kyle would pass by without them bouncing on his hands and knees!

You may have noticed that we had to factor in the factors of event and action here.  What is the nature of monster driving kids off their skids?  What does it look like for them to get hit by a monster while riding around in an enclosed box? What is the rational behind this event and action?  These are very important issues that only can be resolved in a meaningful way by definition! Let's do this by looking at how dictionaries usually handle these concepts.

In dictionaries, different events are usually described by different lexical categories.  For example, there's a whole lexicon dedicated to the key "speeding," which typically involves driving fast in an effort to avoid any potential hit - so what's really going on here is that someone is driving a car so fast (per the lexicon) that it is unable to prevent another car from hitting them! This is a pretty common event and action - speeding up is a normal and natural thing and it is just about as unnatural to fly backwards in time as it is to fall down off the roof! If this is just a random and non-meaningful event, then no - someone needs to be held accountable for it, but this doesn't follow!

On the other hand, there's a whole lexicon dedicated to the lexical category "death," which essentially refers to situations where a person dies without trying to escape - in this case, the zombie spell is defined to mean that the zombie walks around with his head hanging in one direction, so that others can't kill him on the sidewalk! Again, this is usually an unintended and unnatural occurrence and it is a classic example of ineffective naming!  

To sum it up: a lexical dictionary is a highly valuable and invaluable resource - but it is designed by humans! The only place that it can make sense is when it is specifically applied to a lexical term that is being defined. Simply put, how is it possible for humans to come up with what is essentially a hyper-organized pile of random and meaningless data?  Well, it's because humans use "semantic networks" to make sense of the data they create. Semantic networks are a collection of semantic rules and heuristics that we use to generate meaningful associations and thereby guide our thinking. In essence, if a person applies a lexical dictionary to a lexical term like "speeding" and they find that all categories are very closely associated, then the thesaurus is pretty much complete and can now be used to help the speaker with their meaning!

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the top of everyone's mind when we think about three-dimensional space-time is an endless space filled with objects floating in space above us. In particular, this space represents the spatial topology of an infinite number of objects that are intertwined and glued together in all sorts of ways!

Imagine, if you like, a giant drop of ink, lying on a large piece of paper, for the sake of this image. Now imagine that an observer comes along and removes all of this ink from this paper, just to examine it! You'd think that this ink would disappear - but no, apparently it just can't...or shouldn't...!

There are people in this world that think that we are doing them a big favor by keeping some of these ink bottles so that they can 'look' at them when they are not under the microscope! According to them, ink tends to degrade faster when the drops don't get air-bagging and exposed to the sun, which is in turn associated with high temperature and higher pressure. After removing all of the ink, we would then wonder, were we really helping them, or were we just taking their little bottles of ink out of sight!? I know I've been told that ink bottles are best kept out of view, and those who don't enjoy the smell of ink probably won't be offended by this!

It's interesting to note that this perception of ink bottles being'seen' by people is a common one - people might even think they are being good by keeping the ink bottles and bottles of ink out of sight! If this was true, why would it bother someone to keep ink bottles in their office? It's far more pleasant for me personally, to keep ink bottles in my office! Of course, the reality is more complicated than just this: ink tends to decompose faster when the drops are completely surrounded by air, because once water evaporates, the drops begin to adhere to one another due to the pressure, not because they degrade any quicker...since they aren't completely enclosed!

Now let's take a quick look at an example of ink destruction. Keep in mind that this process has taken place in our lab...on paper! And also keep in mind that when we do experiments on ink, we keep all of the salts and various additives out of the solution we use to make the ink. So consider this ink solution containing only water, sugar, and iodine - for the sake of this experiment, let's assume we are using fresh ink from a manufacturer that's renowned for its purity - which is fine if the ink is new, but if it isn't, we could have a different result!

Let's now step back a little and take a look at this ink solution, and see what happens. We can immediately see that water is dissolved in the liquid as it evaporates, leaving us with a completely 'watery' liquid. This is because water forms - meaning it dissolves in other liquids - and then the only solution that remains is the liquid that is contained within the ink, the one that we see with our eyes! It is also interesting to note that if we remove the iodine from the solution, we don't get the liquid that we see with our eyes anymore, but we get no liquid at all! However, the other liquids in the solution still do remain - we still have water, sugar, and the iodine! Of course, if we were to add the salt back in, there would be more of these other liquids in the solution! Let's also note that the rate of evaporation of these liquids will depend upon the number of times we add salt to this solution - and we'll get more evaporation if we add salt less frequently...like once or twice a week!

So to sum up, this is a very weird, but important experiment that shows the water/iodine salt (glucose)/sugar (sugar cane) linkage. If we removed all the water, all the iodine, and all the sugar from this solution, it would still be a very watery liquid - with a trace of liquid protein and salt remaining. In fact, if we kept all the solution, the trace of liquid protein would be gone completely. However, if we removed all the salt from the solution, the protein would still be present...meaning there is still a small amount of liquid protein present in the ink solution!

Now, to your best interest, let's wait a minute - what's going on here? Because we removed all the other substances, what would happen if we removed the solvent completely? Since the solvent is still there, what is going on inside this ink bottle? Wouldn't the ink still contain liquid protein? This is because protein is soluble in water...meaning that the protein will continue to'melt' with the solution as the water evaporates...thus leaving a larger amount of protein dissolved in the solution after the evaporation of the water. Now how about the iodine, sugar, and glucose? Can the iodine continue to dissolve in the ink solution, or would it just evaporate? The answer to this question is no, and our guess is that the only way to look at the inside of this ink bottle is to remove the iodine, sugar, and glucose completely, as they are the only liquids that

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts discussed in this chapter, I'll break them down into very easy-to-follow categories. At first glance, this might appear like an exercise in guesswork, but it really isn't! Each of the categories represent a different facet of ENFJ's cognitive abilities. Here they are:

Mathematical Functions: Math in the ENFJ is easy and efficient. Noise analysis can be done quickly, even if we have to do it in our heads. Statements can be quickly formulated, tested, and checked. If the right answer is found, it isn't hard to come up with a justification for it.

Temporal Functions: As you can see, ENFJ is adaptable, curious, and willing to embrace new ideas. She loves being a part of projects that involve logical proofs and calculations. As long as they are done well and easily, no one can challenge her.
Creative Expressions: In general, ENFJ tends to believe in the magical ability of creative expression. She may have different ideas than her contemporaries, but these creative ideas tend to have a better chance of being accepted. No one can challenge her.
Logical Reasoning: If you ask her how she thinks, she can be clueless. All she can tell you is, "I am thinking."
Preparedness for Analysis: A great deal of mathematical knowledge has been stored up in the ENFJ's brains. She can efficiently process problems using methods that older ones weren't aware of. This makes her easy to teach to others.
Altruism: Because she is willing to help others, ENFJ has the ability to build relationships. As long as everyone accepts her without some sort of pressure, she can be an effective friend.
Self-Efficacy: Because she believes in her own abilities, she can trust her own judgment. She trusts the opinions and ideas of others, but she is willing to challenge the opinions and ideas of others.

We will need a few pictures to better illustrate the idea of this book:

Source: Anxious Engagers

Next, we'll look at some of the questions that a trained ENFJ would attempt to answer (not sure about you?) if they were asked in an exam.

For yourself: In what order should you add the numbers one through five? Is there anything I can do to help my students better understand math questions?

For you: How does the ENFJ understand the math used in her job? Would you like to do the same for your team?

For yourself: How often do you check math papers and tests after you have studied them?

For you: If I read the words "If you…" next to a question, do you think that makes sense to me?

For yourself: How easy do you think it is to know all the mathematical terms?

For yourself: When you learn how to use calculus and other advanced math tools, do you have trouble figuring out the underlying principles that make up those tools?

For yourself: You said that most calculations are mental. What does the math mean in your opinion?

For yourself: If I draw a path through a piece of paper and put the point X next to it, will the point be along the path? Why or why not? You might also be able to understand this by writing down the equations that make up the path! Then you can use logic to find the correct answer!

For yourself: How do you rate your mathematical ability? Do you believe that you can learn any mathematics without a lot of practice?

For yourself: How long does it take you to complete homework for math?

For yourself: How fast can you read mathematics text books?

For yourself: How much time do you spend on math when you are studying?

For yourself: Do you believe in the magic of the human brain?

For yourself: How do you experience math, at a high level? Do you believe that you can learn any mathematics without a lot of practice?

For yourself: How much does it take to tell a person they are doing it well, based on the simple fact that you do it well?

For yourself: How easy is it to do calculations on computers?

For yourself: Do you usually have to wait for a solution when you are a mathematical problem solver?

For yourself: Can you predict math problems given only the solution and the rest of the problem?

For yourself: Do you believe in arithmetic triangles?

For yourself: How much are students prepared for ENFJ grade level algebra?

For yourself: Why does math have a magical element in it? Does it also exist in physics, chemistry, and biology?

For yourself: If you decide to study physics or biology, how much help would you want to have in the learning of these subjects?

For yourself: How do you learn algorithms and coding?

For yourself: How do you remember the rules of an equation?

For yourself: What problem would you like to work on if you were to take a math test?

For yourself: Do you take an algebra class or your Math department offers calculus courses as a part of another course?

For yourself: How do you relate math and science?

For yourself: How many decimals are there on the wrong

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the kind of mental effort required to handle mathematics, we have included a highly detailed example of a student who is involved in a Science Olympiad! This student is a 6 year old student in Grade 5 in a predominantly Catholic school. Despite having the materials to prepare themselves for the Olympiad, they are struggling. At the time of this writing the Student has not been able to solve a problem as well as she would like. In addition to having difficulty with mathematics at an early age, the Student has had trouble learning the key components to solving a problem, such as probability and evaluating algorithms, or have difficulty integrating previous mathematical knowledge (including the concepts of geometry) with new mathematics (especially with calculus).

I think one of the more interesting things to see here is that the Student has no problem with geometry! In fact, she has a couple of very advanced concepts that I don't understand (such as proving a triangle is right when "just" adding two perpendicular lines) - which may indicate that she doesn't need the extra points in the plane. However, all of this seems to contradict the theory that she has that she is a prodigy in math!
In addition, she is a fantastic reader! She is able to pass all of our math test pieces, and is reading the entire document in about 5 minutes. Also, she is able to re-read any of the test items without problems! In this student's case, I would love to know what factors influenced her confidence in completing these test pieces on time. If she has difficulty remembering answers to some math problems, would this be indicative of the need for more focus (or perhaps motivation) or might it simply be due to her ability to re-read items?

I really wonder how many mathematics prodigies around the world (particularly 7th graders) are receiving such support! If the student has encountered these difficulties during a math class in their life, what resources does the school have for them?

Assessment Theory Mathematics

As we have already mentioned, evaluating one student based on whether or not he/she did a good job solving a math problem or re-matching pieces of information from previous math test questions is not sufficient. When it comes to grades, the best measure of a student's success is how well they are applying the mathematics in their class. Without implementing this kind of differentiation, it is extremely difficult to help a student acquire the skills necessary to perform effectively in the future. Fortunately, there is a relatively recent advancement in the field of mathematics called Behavioral Assessment.
Let me give you an example of a student who successfully received a failing grade for a test because of poor math problem-solving:

This is my daughter, and she received a failing grade for a math problem due to a lack of problem-solving skills. So, here's an example of what she was wrong with. "Answer 5/3" represents the formula used to solve the given problem. The concept of "infinity degree" is represented by the same dot in black on the left, and the denominator "3/3" represents the number used in the formula. If the given equation is given in parentheses, the calculated result is only $0.3333$...but when written in letters on the right, the result is equal to $2.45$. In math, as we have learned, 2.5 times three = five! Why is this so? In an algebra problem, students would use a 'plus' symbol instead of a 'divide' symbol. The + symbol is used to denote the addition of two numbers - one at a time - and the divide symbol is used to denote the division of the two numbers together, rather than separately.
In addition, each test item requires at least one measurement - a number, letter, or other thing. If a test item only asks for a number, you could show the student the following graph -

The graph shows the error between the actual number ($5$) and the desired result ($3.45$). If the student answered $5/3$ correctly, then there would be a negative measurement error of $3$ (the - symbol on the graph) - in this case, the incorrect answer. Now to the action! If you can show the student that while $5$ is correct (with a negative measurement error), then $3.45$ is not correct, then you can conclude that the student is unable to carry out the mathematics correctly! You would then compare the correct answer with the incorrect answer to determine if the student was able to convert the measurement errors to an equation in math terms. Or in other words, whether or not the student was able to figure out the mathematical symbols (sqrt or negative) used to represent measurement errors when solving the problem.
Now that you have shown the student how to relate math problems to measuring units, this step should be followed by a process of discussing the results of her answer with her classmates. The important thing is that your discussion should be thorough - explain the math problems in detail and how to solve the given problem (determine the denominator or the difference between the two numbers) in order to answer the questions. This discussion would include one at a time answering the questions on the test paper as well as brainstorm

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the amazing possibilities of mathematical thought, let me just describe an elementary chapter that was included in the Fall 1999 MATH 101 course at Ohio State University. It features a conceptual map called the geometrical complex of the sun, which mathematically describes our solar system (Figure 16).
You may recall that in previous chapters, we introduced the concept of spatial dimensions. We demonstrated how we can view points on a 2D plane as 3D points on a 3D plane, and vice-versa. We also discussed how point-light interactions lead to spatial vision.

Now let's consider the problem of interpreting vector objects such as light. To do this, we need to extract information about the points that cause light to appear (the coordinates of the light source) and then decompose the vector into spatial components. This is similar to taking a slice through the point-light graph, which can be described by 2D parallel lines that intersect at the points where light is caught by our eyeball! Now let's take another 2D slice and take the "vertical" portion - the line segment between those two points on the plane - to describe it as a 3D vector, with each of the points labelled by the vector coordinates along the line segment. And let's recall that the vector field is essentially the continuous extension of the vector object to higher dimensions.

Now let's look at the geometry behind the sun and how it forms the solar system. As mentioned above, the sun is very highly curved - basically a 4D universe that we are currently experiencing in a 3D universe. The energy that is being put into us from space is actually radiating from the center of the sun towards outer space - hence the cylindrical shape of the sun! This very strong curvature creates a potential barrier for objects traveling across it, thus making it very difficult for any object to move through. However, by taking a slice-through of the sun's geometry we can find what happens when we launch a virtual photon into the space around the sun!

In most cases, a particle launched from the center of the sun will come to rest within a region of space that is very near the center of the sun itself - though this is not always the case. The process of our living being's physical being at rest within a relatively close region of space (similar to a cell within a body) is called centripetal acceleration. Let us also note that the velocity of a moving particle is determined by the mass, length, and shape of the particle. In order to determine the velocities of point-light objects, the astronaut or the scientist can perform a series of experiments that will reveal the equations of motion for the particles in question. Let's briefly review how point-light particles behave as they are launched into a space of varying curvatures - and what you can learn from the results!

First let's consider how a point light that is launched into a 3D space would approach the sun's center! Let us also assume that the vector of the photon that is being launched can be approximated by a small wedge with the shape of a ray, as depicted by the lines parallel to the axis of a box in Figure 16. With this initial condition, the photon will move around the sun from left to right, making it appear to move in a circular path - but the initial velocity of the photon does not match the speed of light as it moves through our 3+1 dimensional universe!

Let's now simulate what happens if a virtual photon is launched from the center of the sun at the speed of light. As we can see from Figure 16, we need to fix the initial position of the point-light particle - it is good practice to use a value that is large enough to approximate the true position of the photon as it is launched. Let's now simulate what would happen to the point-light particle if it is launched from the true position of the photon! Let us consider that the vector of the photon is positioned at the point where the real center of the sun would be. Now let's assume the initial velocity of the photon is half as much as light's speed at this point - this gives us the approximate initial velocity of the photon when it is launched! Of course, as we launch the photon from its true position, the initial velocity will decrease until it reaches the speed of light - and as it approaches this point, it begins to diverge from the speed of light! That's because the photon's trajectory will approach the axis of the box, where the angle between that axis and the true vector of the photon approaches π/3. As this occurs, the trajectory of the point-light particle approaches a straight line - which is then tangent to the center of the box as the photon approaches this center. As the photon continues to travel, the angle between the photon trajectory and the line tangent to the center of the box approaches π/2 - which is the value of the initial velocity of the photon at the true position! This process is called centripetal acceleration.

As you can see from the simulation above, a virtual photon will start to travel through a large amount of space before it reaches the axis of the sun's center - we have defined the initial velocity of this virtual photon as being half as much as light's speed at that point. This is what we call the "pre-lambda" movement of the photon. After

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we are studying in this chapter, we will choose to explain concepts in simpler ways. This way it will be easier for the students to grasp the concepts. For example, now that we know that particles have a 5D and a 4D component, we can make a good point by saying that a 3D particle does not pass through any 3D space first - it cannot enter Dimension X - and as such, it does not need to "ride" the curvature of Dimension X to gain access to Dimension Y (we'll explain later). Similarly, a 3D particle doesn't need to "ride" the curvature of Dimension Y to gain access to Dimension Z; it can simply take its course of motion through Dimension Z without encountering any intervening 3D space first - it is purely 4D! In fact, the symmetry of time is broken in our 4D universe... this means that we can simultaneously see time go backwards and forwards - that is why we say that we can see time traveling backwards and forwards! 
Let's also use the idea of "arbitrary distance" to introduce a key concept here. This is the fundamental concept that describes how distance between objects can change depending on how far the objects are from each other. In this case, let's say the distance between any two objects in a particular 3+1 dimensional space is known - let's call it D. Now imagine that we can measure the distance between any two objects in space and make a graph connecting the two objects. Then in the 4D space, we'll have a graph connecting the two objects with the same number of lines and the same width, but longer. This will give us an idea of how long D actually is...

Now let's examine how the distance between two different objects can change depending on the relative position of the two objects in 4D space. Let's say we're studying dandelions. Since these plants have diameters that are all different, it is reasonable to consider D as being arbitrary. Now imagine that dandelions were placed in two different 3+1 dimensional spaces. Let's call them D 1 and D 2. Assuming the dandelions are placed on the horizontal and vertical axes of the 4D graph, then D 1 and D 2 represent the total distance between these two objects. Now let's consider how the distance between two objects in 4D space changes as we move the object from one position to another. Let D be the total distance between the two objects in space, and let S be the number of times we make a vertical step from D to D + S. This gives us an idea of how we would go from D to D + S, and what would happen if we ever moved the dandelions from one position to another. 

Now let's consider our 9D dandelion. The dandelions are arranged in several discrete and varying spatial categories - they may be gathered by branches and other plants in a row (like a barnacle), or they may be formed by lines or clouds of dandelion heads on their branches (like a dragonfly). We will discuss each of these in more detail below. In all of the cases, we will define dandelion collections and dandelion heads in the next three chapters.

Now let's consider each of these discrete and varying 3+1 dimensional spaces (basically how they are represented on a graph) as represented on our 4D graph, and make our understanding more concrete. Let's say we have 9D dandelions arranged in three different collections:

One of our 9D dandelion collections is in the middle of an 11D spiritual forest, and the other is a collection of smaller branches and dead plants on one side. In this case, we would identify D as the line connecting the two objects in the horizontal and vertical axes of the 4D graph. This will be our "arbitrary distance" for this particular collection.

Two of our 9D dandelion collections are on opposite sides of an 11D spiritual forest, and the other is a collection of larger branches on one side and smaller branches and dead plants on the other side. In this case, we would identify D as the line connecting the two objects in the horizontal and vertical axes of the 4D graph. This will be our "arbitrary distance" for this particular collection. 

Three of our 9D dandelion collections are arranged on different sides of the 11D spiritual forest, and the other is a collection of smaller branches on one side and larger branches on the other side. In this case, we would identify D as the line connecting the two objects in the horizontal and vertical axes of the 4D graph. This will be our "arbitrary distance" for this particular collection.

Four of our 9D dandelion collections are arranged at different distances from the 11D spiritual forest, and the other is a collection of branches and leaves on one side and branches and roots and flowers and other plants on the other side. In this case, we would identify D as the line connecting the two objects in the horizontal and vertical axes of the 4D graph. This will be our "arbitrary distance" for this particular collection.

Let's see how our 9D dandelion collections change as we move them from one position to another. Let's assume we

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our ability to understand the world around us, we have used science to create an ability that we term ESFJ (for Einstein Stellar-Frequency-Jung!). We are taught ESFJ specifically for all of the mathematical concepts presented throughout this course! These concepts allow students to understand the world around us from an abstract standpoint, and also allows for us to create true universes where we can successfully navigate our way through space and time. However, these concepts are vastly more abstract than that and are often difficult for us to master because of our innate mathematical abilities - and maybe that is where our success comes in. But don't worry, we're here to help! We will share more specifics on how ESFJ works in the next few chapters - so let's get started!

To better depict your mathematical knowledge, it's helpful to put it into a cognitive function graph! Below you can see how a mathematician uses their brain's cognitive capabilities to create mathematical ideas, analyze mathematical concepts, and evaluate mathematical proofs!

As I mentioned earlier, the above figure provides an overview of what mathematicians use their cognitive abilities to accomplish. You can check out the more detailed part of that graph here.

Things you might do.

Go to any of the numerous libraries around your area and check out what books they have for mathematics. Much of the academic work in mathematics is based on experience with certain types of objects in nature. But as you go through this mathematical subject from scratch, you may have seen examples of objects that are conceptually related to mathematics and on which you can easily make mathematical analogies. For example, if you know how large a windmill could be, you may be able to infer what a standard windmill would be from its shape. Similarly, if you know how some animals like bats migrate across the Earth, you may be able to infer the similarities in orbit and flight paths between a bird and a butterfly. There are many types of analogies.
Put some examples of the topics you studied in school into the objects in your library. Think about the similarity between a butterfly and a bird. Which is higher? The insect or the bird?
Take a look at the tables from the book and put these examples in the appropriate columns, like see above. What are the similarities and differences between the objects?
Consider adding your own ideas to the tables. Do you see similarities between different kinds of geometric figures? What about relations between the shapes of a circle, a square, and a cone? Show each figure using a different kind of device. Ask if it is possible to rearrange the figures using devices.
If you have enough time, write a math essay for the book, summarizing the ideas. Or better yet, make up your own math paper for the book.

I had the opportunity to ask Patrick Duffy, Professor of Mathematics at Rutgers, a senior fellow in mathematics education, about his experiences in learning mathematics. Duffy then takes the questions asked and answers from the learners.

To understand why a person may fail mathematics in school, and why this is also one of the biggest problems in college algebra, one must understand first, what do students do when they are learning mathematics? They do so first, at the level of principle, through systems of proofs, of types of proof, and of hierarchies of proof (a descending sequence of logical formal structures to be used as a system of proofs for a given mathematical question). These level of analysis will determine in many important respects how a student finds it useful to study mathematics as a whole. We will not focus on the exact form of these formal structures, but we will point to some general observations.

A major problem of mathematics education is that students frequently ignore, as they do not like mathematics, the basic rules of inference that set the stage for new ideas. People confuse structure with form or pattern with system of mathematics. Students fail to understand the first step in the process of theorizing. If a student stumbles upon a proof that uses the logical method, but doesn't know where the proof came from, they feel that mathematics is nothing more than cipher. This doesn't mean that the process of proof itself isn't right or important. However, the student's sense of rightness, or the message of mathematics that was transmitted through the formal mathematical structures that led to the proof, may be important.
Rather than learning to use formal systems of mathematics, students find it useful to solve problems that they can solve algebraically. This is what the colleges of mathematics use as the model for mathematics education. If this had been true of algebra, all students would be good at algebra, but there would be a number of reasons why algebra wouldn't be taught, for example a connection with mechanics. If mathematics education is designed to include mechanical systems, it may require some new emphasis on proof in the formal structure. So while students may get good at the more traditional math systems, many students lose their interest in mathematics and attend some other subject.
There is also the important question of training. Why is it important to train the mathematicians of tomorrow, and how do you train them? The same critical principle applied to mechanics might be a useful idea in determining what is important in education. People who do math for a living will agree that the correct thought process is to employ the rule of inferences, and when the rules of inferences are not used, students leave the math course. The converse of this point of view is that mathematicians with difficult questions and problems that might get students interested, cannot justify their work. If we were to label any such thing as not valid, it would lose value.
How do we evaluate a mathematician? One can pick a group of students for a mathematical workshop, where they are asked to solve some mathematical questions. The best mathematicians, those whose questions have deep insight in what they are asking, will be right on point. A poor mathematician may offer a solution that might be the obvious and seem plausible, but is simply unsound.

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the breadth of mathematics that we will need in the fourth level, we would like to introduce the concept of ESTJ Cognitive Functions. This term refers to an analytical idea that we have come to rely on extensively throughout our lives to understand math problems - perhaps not consciously, but as an inherent part of our understanding of math.

Obviously, the concept of ESTJ Cognitive Functions has its origins in Cartesian geometry. But in our fourth level we will apply this concept to understand math in three slightly different ways - each of which demonstrates just how helpful ESTJ Cognitive Functions can be in the area of mathematics.

First, in order to find the area of a circle or figure, we apply ESTJ Cognitive Functions (see Figure 1).

If we only know its diameter, but we don't know the circumference, then we can make the following independent estimates:

The circumference of the circle = the diameter + the length of the shortest axis that runs from the center of the circle to its perimeter

The circumference of the figure = the diameter + the length of the longest axis that runs from the center of the figure to its perimeter

The area of the figure = the perimeter

We can determine the area of a circle simply by taking the average of the area of each of its constituent parts (diameter and circumference) - or by taking the area of the figure (see Figure 2).

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our core concepts, we'll return to the previous example of a particle traversing space-time. Now imagine that you are standing in a library holding a book - imagine that you are reading something up and down your body until you reach a wall, at which point you let the book fall down and follow the wall. Now imagine that this wall is made up of many diverse materials - everything from wood, through metal, to glass, to stone, to your own skin...you get the idea - there is a wall and you have access to several different types of materials! Now imagine that you have access to various different types of materials, but instead of the glassy material you thought about before, you have thin horizontal layers of metal. Of course, every time you dip your finger into the hole in your book, your hand will reach another different material, which gives you another perspective and an angle you can't normally get without these layers of materials!

Let's say for example that you are interested in spending some time studying Mathematics. Now imagine that you have several books that are all different types of math objects...like numbers, equations, graphs, etc...each one represented by a piece of paper on a piece of paper. You could dip one hand into one of the books, and the other hand could be dipped into another book, each time reading a different piece of the object. Or you could be reading and dipping your finger in and out of different books, one after another. You could also study astronomy and look at your sky in different ways, like by walking down a pole, or looking into a telescope.

Remember that physics applies to all situations - some things work better in a certain way, while other things are significantly easier in a different way. In mathematics, we can study how a certain topic works in different contexts - we can investigate how different shapes behave in different circumstances. So, if I were to draw up a list of questions in a lab, and we could not really pinpoint to one specific question - we could still look at different ways that shape will behave when placed in a certain situation. And it doesn't have to be all math. We could also look at elements that fall into the same category of objects, like metals, or matter (substance). In this case, we'll call these ideas "relativistic" and "non-relativistic" concepts, respectively.

I think you'll agree with me that these two concepts apply to virtually all things that move in space - from basic concepts that humans have over thousands of years of experience, to elements that fall into the same category. So let's focus on one of the newest subjects to have its own separate section - "Relativistic and Non-Relativistic Concepts"

In relativity theory, there is a principle that states that at every instant in space-time, everything is located at the same exact point in space-time, regardless of what point in space-time it is at. This leads to the result that all objects in a given slice of space-time remain at the same location at that slice of time...so there is no difference in their locations between different times in space-time! Now imagine that you are studying mathematics in a library. You could dip your finger into any number of books, any number of times - but each time, the item you are holding is actually located at different points in space-time. Now imagine that you dip your finger in and out of these books, one after another, an infinite number of times! One of the book's pieces will remain in your hand in every next successive dip, while the other piece will eventually fall out of your hand and into another book! Because the way objects move in spacetime is determined by mass and energy, the more mass and energy there is in a given slice of space-time, the more curved it will be.

This effect is called Time Dilation! If you were to draw a graph of the length of time required for your finger to travel from one place to another - from the beginning to the end of your book, for example - you would notice that this graph of time taken by your finger, is exactly the graph of time taken by your hand! This is because Time Dilation means that every object that is dipped into one place of space-time is dipped into another place of space-time after a certain amount of time has elapsed! Time dilation means that the materials of one location in time would be equivalent to the materials of the same location in space-time many decades later - there's no one slowing down everything!

What about the movement of objects that just fly in the air? For example, imagine an airplane you would be jumping into - now imagine that the airplane is flown across space in the absence of a force. The speed of the airplane will approach infinity, so it will jump far away from where it was. But instead of falling into the ground, the airplane will fly across the sky and reach its final destination very quickly, without losing a single bit of energy! For a rocket to reach its final destination, however, the rocket will have to pick up energy from space and draw it back toward itself, creating a force that will act upon the rocket to slow it down. But in the case

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict and explain any of the dimensions, one can use an enneagram, a physical system that allows the visualization of the main personality types in terms of three fundamental variables:

Intelligence (responsible for the mathematical functions of thinking and learning)
Character (what you do in life and your willingness to take risks)
Neutrality (almost like a third dimension - the body in which you belong)

The three lines that make up a graph, representing intelligence, character, and neutrality are arranged in different shades of green, red, and blue, respectively.

At the root of all dimensions is the mind, which is the conscious part of the brain. Not only are we limited by the number of brain cells that we have (the limits on the human brain are quite steep), but this limited set of cells also has very narrow vision. So we can only see the most critical details of the environment around us at one point in time. If we switch to a different frame of reference, we see different aspects of the same event. In other words, our perception is always changing and shifting.
One way to explain this is that each layer of the human brain is responsible for the visualization of a different aspect of reality. The physical world is represented by the gray line, the mind is represented by the blue line, and the spiritual realm is represented by the red line. So this is one of the three dimensions that we can choose to work with while completing a dimension map.

Now let's dig deeper into the bottom part of the enneagram. According to the enneagram, there are six main types of personality that represent the six main types of intelligence. And each type of personality has a color in the enneagram graph, representing how it relates to each of the other four types of intelligence. If the configuration of the enneagram is a lower, red, blue, or green line, then the type of personality that we have is called lower-level personality. If the configuration is a higher, red, blue, or green line, then the type of personality that we have is called higher-level personality.

Of course, since we all have multiple levels of personality, there can be combinations of two types of personality, such as Middle Level and Lower Level, for example. However, because there are only six main personality types, it is not possible for any of them to make up the whole of personality, so there is nothing unnatural about the highest levels of personality making up only the minority of the total. Personality is a very complicated thing, and I would be hard pressed to find anything wrong with that.

Now let's look more closely at the four types of intelligence. While there are many variations on the mathematical formula for intelligence, the idea is that intelligence is affected by the degree of physical activity - something that is shared by the four main intelligence types. So higher levels of intelligence can be attributed to individuals who are more physically active - people like to work and play, research, and learn more about the world.
In short, higher levels of intelligence are attributed to individuals that are more physically active. In fact, when it comes to the big picture, however, this is not the case. It seems that intelligence, by itself, isn't much of a factor in determining our behavior. This is because intelligence is only one of many other physical and mental skills that allow us to learn, think, and express ourselves.

Now about personality. It's important to note that personality actually refers to the boundaries of a person's personality - the psychological makeup of that person. Think of personality as the "floor plan" that determines our actions. While personality may vary greatly across people, their boundaries generally resemble the lines separating our intelligence and character levels - i.e., they tend to be rather open and flexible.

Let's look more closely at one of the more interesting aspects of personality - the big five. According to the Big Five theory, all human personality consists of five different fundamental parts. These five fundamental parts of personality are:

Consciousness - this is where we intuit things, and make sense of what is going on around us.
Memory - this is the part of our brain that keeps us aware of our current surroundings
Feelings - a feeling of calmness and happiness
Emotion - emotional responses, such as anger, sadness, and happiness
Thinking - our ability to reason

In other words, the big five provides a basic framework for understanding the behavior of humans, but not everything about them.

Of course, all of these five fundamental parts work together to create the Big Five - only these five are what make the personality that we have. Each of the five parts of personality forms a distinct functional part of the Big Five - some of these parts are directly related to one another. For example, feelings are directly related to memory, thinking is directly related to memory, and emotion is directly related to memory. Additionally, the emotional response, thinking, and feeling levels often partially overlap and reinforce each other.

As mentioned earlier, people vary greatly in terms of their level of intelligence, so we can easily see that people with higher levels of intelligence will often have more developed psychological skills. Now to see why this is the case, we need to dive deeper into

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict this process, it would be useful to have a brief overview of Hip Hop NLP. Hip Hop NLP is a direct, intensive teaching style of language that utilizes many of the same basic skills as traditional "styled" or conventional NLP. These skills include speech, reading, writing, listening, and comprehending/interpreting.

The core idea of Hip Hop NLP is that a person's current style of thinking is related to their previous style of thinking. And since the ways of thinking that we used when we were children have an impact on the way we view and act the next generation, we can change the way we think with Hip Hop NLP. We use many of the same skills as traditional language and communication tools such as speaking, reading, writing, listening, and comprehending/interpreting as we teach our kids to use Hip Hop NLP language.

Animals with Cognitive Realm Charts

Nate Rosenbaum has created a set of cognitive maps that help us understand complex concepts more easily, and makes them much more accessible.

One of the main purposes of a cognitive map is to help us organize the information we hold about something and quickly see which concepts we need to master. The cognitive map created by Nate is called a cognitive realm chart, and explains how certain things can be categorized into cognitive domains - or the "senses" by which animals can comprehend their environment.

In the beginning, we are probably most familiar with this cognitive map of realms for animals - we all have one of these, however animals also have a number of cognitive domains that are very different from those of humans. Here is a great site to learn more about cognitive maps:

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the concept of a directional arrow in physics has something very important to do with spacetime. In many situations, a physical object will follow a path that is similar to a path that was just driven backwards. Is this familiar to you? Yes, it is.  Let's take a closer look at this idea.

The concept of a directional arrow in physics is used a lot in mathematics, but I think it has a special role in physics as well! Let's take a closer look at how to understand this concept...

The space-time we live in can be broken down into three fundamental components, spacetime, space, and time. This is where things begin to become incredibly complicated. Space-time also contains a different type of structure that is unique to higher dimensions - it's called a dimension!

Every dimension has three fundamental components, space, time, and dimension, and there is also an additional dimension called "geometry". Let me give you a brief summary of what these three components mean in mathematics, but the explanation goes a bit further and can be found on many different websites:

Spatial Dimension is the smallest dimension we can see - all of our 3D objects (like our hands) can be seen only in this dimension. Also, since all our 3D objects have dimensions, they can be described in this dimension in many different ways.

Time Dimension is the middle dimension in between Space and Dimension X - so when our hands are held together (as in the picture above), they can still be seen even though the objects at the sides aren't in the same 3D space as the hands. When our hands are held together in that fashion, we can also talk about the actions of other objects in that space and time.

Dimension X is the highest dimension in the universe - all of the higher dimensional objects are in this dimension. But why is this dimension special? Well if you look closely at this picture, the first object in this dimension is the cube - our most basic object, and the most basic thing we can see! As we further move along the cube's sides, other objects begin to appear on its surface, like the wall it is sitting on, our skirt, the plates we are carrying around, and many more. But is this really the cube? No - all of the higher dimensional objects are in Dimension X and in many different forms and sizes. But these are just another way of understanding how objects can be described in different dimensions.

So we see that every object in the universe can be described in all three fundamental components (space, time, and dimension) in each of the three different ways that are possible. As you can imagine, with the three fundamental components, there are a lot of things that our brains can think about that can help us create maps to the world! The fact that this situation is similar to a map is also very important - this creates the idea of a directional arrow that does not pass through any of the other two dimensions but remains a stable direction regardless of whether we are travelling in one direction or the other!

But there is one more important point about directional arrows - unlike most other physical concepts like angles, directions, or distances, the directional arrow does not originate with a starting point and continues in a straight line until it reaches a destination. It does not have an initial condition that causes it to continue the specified direction. For instance, if the sun follows the same line from the sun's centre of mass, to Earth, it will always be on its path. And with different directions, it can always end up in the same position! Let's check this out...

Given a unit vector normal to the plane of a plane, and a unit vector pointing along the vector normal, we can easily find the direction of this vector relative to the normal, and define the Euclidean unit vector to be the one pointing along the vector normal to the plane.

So you have seen that directions do not always originate in a starting point and continue along a straight line. The directions of objects can be described in all three fundamental dimensions and not only in just one, but more than one way. In fact, the directional arrows can be described in multiple ways (both clockwise and anticlockwise, in either the x or the y direction), depending on which direction we look at them in!

On the other hand, we can find a directional arrow only when all the different directions are taken into account - that's right, the directional arrow is only useful when it is combined with more than one other component of the three-dimensional space-time of the physical world! Imagine the following scenario: we want to take a ride in a car - but then we stop the car. Instead of continuing driving to our destination, we have to rely on other vehicles to take us to our destination. But since our car can only see its own 3D space and no other things on the road, what directional arrows will this directional arrow follow? Well the directional arrow will simply stop at the other car and continue on its own track! In other words, the directional arrow will simply continue along the vector normal to the plane of the road when it is constructed by looking at all the different directions of our space-time.

So you see that there are infinite

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the difference between the five skills required for a game designer, let's look at two very simple things first. First, let's compare the skill levels of a designer who wants to build a console game to a designer who wants to build a particle accelerator! Both of them have their skills set up to understand and fine tune their particular problem. What distinguishes a designer who wants to make a game from a designer who wants to make an accelerator is that the former must know all the answers, while the latter must only know the ones that come with the problem in hand.

Let's create a simple game called "Big Area Collision". If you want to put the human player in the game, then you need to be able to run the game in multiple contexts, like a 3D console game. However, you will not get any performance improvements with this approach, as you would have to update the state of the game every time your player collides with anything. There is no reason to bother if you only need to game objects that the human player interacts with (such as ice and snow, buildings, etc). But what if the game state is required to change depending on the type of object that the player is interacting with? Let's say you decide you want to build a house for your human player. Then you would want to be able to change the state of your house when your player interacts with a building or with snow. Otherwise the house is not going to change states, and you will have to update the state of all the other objects all the time.

Sounds easy, right? Well, it is! However, before we actually dive into it, there is a caveat: all objects in 3D don't behave the same as objects in 4D! Let's take a look at an example of this and see what we get. Let's make a simple no-fall animation. This is just a way to explain things a little easier for the reader! But the full story here will take a bit more time - we'll come back to that in a little bit.
Let's start with an object called "Snow". This is just a basic 2D object - basically a box of whatever you can think of...dust, mud, snow, trees, a bridge, etc. The idea here is that when the player begins to interact with this object, the object will first start to move forward, then begin to move backwards, then begin to turn inwards, then begin to run away and spin around! That's just basic physics (as the name says). But you can add additional physics to it by inserting additional parameters into the code. For instance, if we want this snow object to throw snow balls (instead of just being moving forward and backwards like the default case), then we can change the default value of "Move" from 0.4 to 1.4 (or whatever you want).
Now as an object moves, it is very important that the visual representation of it stay on-screen - otherwise the user can't tell how far it is from the beginning of the track and how far it's still going! To properly visualize this change, we'll add the following function:

Here is how this snow object looks when moving forward - this is the original version of the snow object, with "Move" set to 0.4.

Now to demonstrate how this snow object behaves when moving backwards (instead of forward):

Here is how this snow object looks when moving backwards - this is the same version as the original, with "Move" set to 1.4.

So now we have added some extra information about how snow objects behave and it is a very simple way to make this snow object move in a much better way. If you don't want to add the new features to the snow object, you can just set "Move" to 1.4 everywhere (and make "Move" 0.4 everywhere else!).

Now let's add a collision effect to the game. This should be the end of the story: let's add a collision effect to the snow object! The basic idea is that if the snow object collides with anything, it should make it bounce forward by a given amount. Let's go over the details of this exercise a bit more:

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the feelings and thoughts of a person and to learn about his/her personality and abilities, mathematics is a great way to understand and improve. It gives us a feel for multiple perspectives, objects, concepts, and procedures - all of which help us develop more sophisticated and knowledgeable thinking skills! Every level of mathematics is important for learning to think critically, reason accurately, and build strategies to manage the realities of our environment!

Let's look at just a few of the ways in which mathematics plays a major role in building our own minds.

Mathematical skills help us reason accurately about what is going on around us - something that is incredibly important for understanding complex social and political situations!

Mathematics and geometry help us understand and see how objects move and behave! For example, we can't walk on straight lines! We could, but we are still not on the right path!

Mathematics helps us make more informed decisions - thanks to quantitative thinking! If you're trying to choose one game that you really want to try to win in a contest, then you need to make sure you're only taking the proper steps so that your decision is based on fact and not only hype!!

In all of these ways, the ability to think is very important for every aspect of life, and mathematical thinking is no exception.

Maths is the body language of the mind - it communicates in a manner we understand, gives us a feeling of belonging, and creates a sense of harmony between ourselves and the world around us. It's a truly mysterious field that's been gaining more attention and recognition as the years go by.

We can learn math in a multitude of ways - books, videos, videos, and more videos! There are many options available to help us learn math in an effective and efficient way!

The most important benefit of learning math is that it increases our mathematical abilities. If we want to excel in math, then we need to develop and maintain these skills for many years after the fact - it's incredibly important to keep improving! However, learning new and more complex math concepts takes time and effort - it's not something that can be done on a whim!

So if you want to learn math, do not wait to get started. Try to find a math activity that interests you and that will keep you learning for many years to come!

Note: As in many other areas of math, there are many fun mathematical activities for children and adults! For a list of some of the best math apps for children and adults, check out our All About Math page! Also, check out the online math courses for Elementary, Middle, and High School students and adults!

If you know Morse Theory, or a rudimentary understanding, try a cheatsheet/algorithm solution for your tasks. Use complex logic to tackle problems if the problem does require it. Sometimes, these things work.
If you need a bit more help getting yourself into thinking about things more fluidly, consider using a 1h digital training (Link). Try setting your mind to “doing”, rather than thinking in “how-to-solve.”
Be prepared to lose your programming skills. I refer to people wanting to focus on the logic parts of a game rather than code. If they want to add a map or unit to a piece of code and those parts appear to be purely logical, then that’s fine. This can only help as you move to more detailed tasks.

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea that mathematics is central to INFPs, let us look at a specific mathematical concept. Let's call it a point process. In physics, a point process is a mathematical model used to describe the random movement of objects in space.

Given a point process representing the motion of an entity in the Universe (such as a cosmic neutron), we can then plot its spatial trajectories to see how it travels through different dimensions - such as how it can either go straight through from one dimension to another or turn around and then go straight through again!

What a deity like Harry Potter might represent would look like a point process! It would have one prominent point, which represents the cosmic neutron that we keep track of in the minds of ALL SMOOTH JINKIES, where we keep track of ALL the deities' creations and appearances! Also, this points would have a random radius, which represents the time since the creation of the deity! And let's also include a small dot within that circle that represents the location and time at which the creator of the deity created him - which can be found at the bottom of the point process! This dot would then represent the location of the creator of the deity at the time the deity was created, which means that the point process represents a deity who created him, left him there, and came back later and proceeded to change his appearance! Since he never visited that location, the dot just represents time.

This point process would represent the deity in question moving through Space! Note that it is quite challenging to visualize the motion of such a deity in a plot! But let's break it down!

As we look at the point process, we can see that the deity's spatial trajectory moves through Space and Dimension X. This means that even though the deity created and has an appearance, he isn't actually in Space, but rather in Dimension X - which is different from his native dimension!

As mentioned above, we can also use dimension to understand and predict the behavior of particles that travel through different dimensions. Given that the deity created the particle, it doesn't surprise us that it behaves like a deity - right!

Finally, there are a few interesting bits of information on dimensionality that you might find useful. Most notably, we can use dimension to understand how dynamic objects behave - a moving object like a deity will not experience any repulsion or attraction when its trajectory moves in different dimensions.

What is dynamic? Dynamic is the ability to perceive an object as a whole and move it around in a meaningful manner. Think of dynamite as a piece of dynamite! If you try to use your knife to "stick" it to a rod of dynamite, you will fail! You would do much better, however, if you used dynamite to stick your knife to the end of the dynamite and then moved it around! That's because dynamite is a sort of "unit" of mass - an object can be viewed as a whole if it is a mass, whereas if it's a mass it's just a piece of dynamite. Thus, an object is called dynamic if it is able to become part of a larger unit, while still moving in a meaningful manner.

In other words, we can use dimensionality to understand and predict the behavior of dynamic objects by looking at how they behave in different dimensions!

So that's it! We've covered a few useful theories about how mathematics is central to INFPs - this has shed some light on the important topics associated with it. Now that we've talked about some interesting mathematical concepts and relationships, we can take a deeper look at some real world examples using that knowledge!

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this great topic and make this more accessible, we've organized the chapters into 3 categories: math, numerology, and spirituality.

Numerology

Numerology is one of the oldest and best known sciences. It examines the manifestation of energies in signs and numbers to help people find their way through life, making them more effective in life. It is used by the majority of people for several reasons - there are some who study it to help them in math, there are others who use it to better understand human behavior, there are others who use it to predict their future, and there are others who use it to better understand the universe as a whole.

Spirituality

Spirituality refers to a person's relationship to their own spirituality. As humans, we tend to be attached to our physical bodies and the physical world; however, we tend to disregard the lives of the deities we call our ancestors and feel that we cannot truly understand or appreciate them. When we discuss God with other individuals, we frequently discuss how He looks like and how He acts - people often think of Him as if He is sitting in their living room and watching us! However, the information that we receive from the deities and their ancestors, both in school and in real life, does not equal that amount of information in real life! The most important fact that the deities and their ancestors share with us in their lives is that they have lived a life of bliss and happiness. The only way to truly understand how you can live with happiness is by learning about God. I believe that the only way to truly understand and appreciate God is through spirituality.

Math

Math is an area of mathematics that is an exact science. Math is used to study the movements of our bodies and the laws that govern them. One of the important qualities of a Mathematician is that he or she should always be clear and straightforward, use simple language, and follow the rules of geometry. Math is the science that deals with the mathematical analysis of data - either numbers or other types of data - to solve problems. As with any study, before you start analyzing anything, you need to research it as much as you can. If you think that you have a clear understanding of a topic, then you should find a book that covers the topic you are interested in to help you understand better - you can also find PDFs of specific books that you are interested in on websites like Goodreads, books.stackexchange, or even go to Google Books to look up the specific book you are interested in.

Differentiated Geometry Geometry Classes

High-level geometry is all the mathematics that doesn't involve hand calculations. This is the math that people like to use everyday - everything you buy, everything you eat, everything you want, everything you go to school for, everything you do is based on geometry. High-level geometry is one of the essential parts of a mathematics program.

Classic Geometry

This is geometry that is used in more modern mathematics. It is also called classic geometry because it has a lot of rules that are used in many different areas of math. For example, when you study geometry, you will sometimes use line segments to represent a line in space. For example, we might draw a line from point A to point B in three different directions - in two dimensions this is a line segment, but it is also possible to use a circle, a parabola, an ellipse, or any other shape to represent this line.

The Mayan Calendar

Modern Maya calendars, or Pictura Maya, are circular, with an exact 360-degree circle on top and cover the entire surface of the Earth. This is a nine-week cycle. You can read about the origins of this calendar in the full-circle Mayan calendar explanation.
We should note that the Mayan calendar is not perfect, and there are some things that can be done with the calendars that will make the Mayan calendar easier to understand. One such example is to add a 24-hour circle to the Mayan calendar, which will cause the Maya calendar to move toward our solar system and from the center of the planet toward the Sun. This will make it more predictable and add layers of interest. Another important addition would be to add a year zero for the Mayan calendar. This would add to the relationship between the Mayan calendar and the solar system.

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict and analyze intelligence in people, I have divided thinking into two main areas:

intellectual intelligence, which includes critical thinking, logical thought, and creative thought.
personal intelligence, which includes creative thinking, intrapersonal and interpersonal relationships, self-management, and adaptability.

Everyday life almost all of us spend most of our time thinking. Think of it as thinking in some rather sophisticated way! If we want to get the job done, we need to think and make decisions! That's what lies at the heart of higher-level thinking, which is what makes us logical, critical, and creative.

Now for the cognitive side of higher-level thinking, we really need to understand how the parts of the brain that are involved in each function can affect one another. This is what we'll be looking at in this chapter!

Before we begin, though, let's take a moment to analyze how humans compare to other animals! According to some studies, mammal species include humans, lynx, elephants, gibbons, cows, dogs, cats, and humans. While we don't know exactly which species is the closest, humans aren't very dissimilar to other animals in this respect. They are perhaps more similar to sharks, but still not the closest in any way to us!

First of all, we will focus on intellectual intelligence - the fact that people can think logically. Human intellect consists of two major categories: logic and reason. As you probably know, thinking as a logical process uses logical rules. Reason uses logic to get things out of the way, which is important for some things, but not necessarily for most. So, while humans are very logical, they aren't generally known for making random or arbitrary decisions.

We can now analyze how our logic can be affected by factors that fall outside of our control. One of these factors is intelligence level. Intuitively, one could say that people with lower levels of intelligence have less "thinking" in them, and therefore are less logical and creative than people with higher levels of intelligence. Although this argument doesn't provide much insight, it is important to understand that people with high intelligence are also interested in the world and about how things work, whereas people with low levels of intelligence are less interested in these things.

The next key factor is childhood. For instance, some argue that younger people with higher levels of intelligence have more intelligence than adults, because the brain has better maturational processes at the age of seven and eight. Others argue that the brain has better processes at the age of seven because, as time passes, the brain starts to develop faster in childhood. At some point it is more difficult for the brain to get by without supporting it from its own amazing development during the age of seven and eight.

Another factor that we could add to this list would be personality. Personality is an aspect of intelligence that we often disregard in our discussions about it. Personality is the "feel" of how we think and respond to different people and situations - and it is affected by culture, genetics, and environmental factors. Unlike intelligence, which is factual, personality is subjective - it cannot be quantified in a statistically meaningful way.

Finally, it is important to realize that intelligence doesn't always give you a competitive edge over other people. I mean, of course, being good at a particular task would be very important! However, you could still lose a significant amount of time, money, or information ("damage control") if you don't perform the task well enough. So don't give up if you don't do your best! And remember that you'll never have to worry about what your "parent's" intelligence level is in order to do their job - you're already doing your job as best as you can!

So there you have it: some more basic background on intelligence, based on some of the more basic scientific principles of psychology and neuroscience. In the next few chapters, we'll be analyzing some important examples of human thinking that can help explain how intelligence works...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict and explain the proposed rules and theories put forth by Einstein and colleagues in the previous chapters, we will start the section by discussing the basic concepts of mathematics.  Mathematics is not simply a set of operations, since we are now in a new dimension where the laws of physics have completely shifted (that is, modified) as a result of the advent of relativity.  Furthermore, we will also introduce the concepts of geometrical figures - buildings, bodies, etc. - that were described by engineers who were, in fact, scratching the surface of the discovery of Newton's laws of motion!

As for the basic rules, all 3+1 dimensional (and many higher dimensional) spaces are built on the same geometrical figure - the cone.  Each 3+1 dimensional space contains a base space with four separate directions - two of which represent a "horizontal" direction (which means that you can move through the space from left to right) and two represent a "vertical" direction (which means you can move through the space from top to bottom).  Also included in the base space are two points located at the intersection of these two directions, which represent the "center" of the geometry (also called the "hinge" point).  By moving through the base space and the point at the "center" of the geometry, the horizontal and vertical directions of space can be created.  Of course, in some higher dimensional spaces, you can also create additional "windows" (or intersections) between the different dimensions. These windows can also be used to create additional "hinges" - hidden openings that take your coordinates inside of a higher dimensional space.
The opening in the base space is called the "range" - in other words, the small hole that exists between two or more dimensions. What is interesting to note is that as you move through a higher dimensional space, each of the individual directions creates a range that is smaller and smaller.  Since all of the dimensions are part of the same "sphere", it turns out that there are infinitely many ranges - something we will discuss in greater detail in the final chapter.
Now that we have discussed the basic concepts of geometry, let's take a look at the next concepts that are used more often in mathematics. These concepts are used to describe small objects, such as numbers, shapes, events, particles, etc.  We will look at these in conjunction with the general concepts we have already discussed, especially the relevant operations and relationships between these concepts.

Firstly, let's look at the number - which is one of the basic concepts in mathematics. In this chapter we will go over the basic rules of multiplication (where two or more numbers add up to the same total, including other numbers), addition (which adds another number to a given number), and subtraction (which takes a given number and subtracts it from another number).  We will also briefly introduce the concept of a base number, which allows you to manipulate smaller numbers without having to recalculate them at the end.
Next, let's look at a shape (or mathematical object). Again, in this chapter we will focus on the operations that help you to construct a shape and then to describe it.  In addition to the basic rules of geometry, we will discuss the other main concepts used to describe shapes - the area, perimeter, etc. - which are related to the boundary of shapes.
Lastly, let's look at a particle (or mathematical object).  We will discuss the basic concepts of motion and energy - how an object can move and how it can be affected by forces. Also, we'll look at the different ways of describing an object - similar shapes, similar coordinates, etc. Then we'll discuss the concepts of mass and momentum, which are related to the power that an object uses to move and exert its force.

As for the main operations and relationships between these concepts, before going any further, we should note that, at some point in time, Einstein's theory of relativity was seriously flawed. Since it was based on the assumption that there was only one space-time - in reality there are five - the various concepts were also questioned in those different dimensions. Einstein tried to overcome the flaws, but wasn't successful. Finally, Einstein made a deal with the Church called the Unification Doctrine, which laid the foundation for Einstein's theory of relativity in the end. However, there is still a possibility that there are other dimensions of space-time that were not explained by Einstein, and we will get to that in the final chapter.

The next section will talk about mathematics in general - which was a big focus of the last three chapters.  In this section, we will also introduce our working definitions of Geometry and Notation (i.e. elements used to describe shapes and particles).  Later on, we'll look at algorithms and algorithms, or mathematically-defined operations, which play a crucial role in mathematics - particularly if you are interested in learning new math as a way to create and solve complex problems. In this section, we'll also introduce the operation of "addition" to help us "translate" the concepts of geometry to our everyday lives - where it will be used to make things easier when trying to solve complex mathematical problems!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the various cognitive functions described above in physics, we will briefly discuss the various components of physical mathematics and the underlying mathematics that describe them. Finally, we will connect these concepts to the physics of dimension travel!

What would be a good name for this section of the book? It seems like a good time to mention that, as our understanding of dimension grows, it has become important to look closely at physical mathematical concepts like infinite vectors. To paraphrase, the infinity in mathematics is a useful description of the infinite possible paths that can be taken by the particle in real space. It is important to note that there are limits to the infinite vector's ability to represent movement. For example, by using the infinite vector alloted to Space X, the particle would have to just physically fly around it indefinitely, instead of continuing to experience velocity indefinitely - a physical impossibility! In fact, using the infinite vector to represent a particle would create something resembling spacetime. This result would be opposite what we saw in the last chapter. If the particles still kept on moving in space, they would not end up moving backwards in time, but would instead fly around in infinite circles.

Why isn't it possible to actually build the infinite vector from the particles that you observe?  I mean, what about equations like the ones of Lagrange, Gauss, and Euler? Are they ever explicitly stated by anyone?

It is clear from the previous discussion that the infinite vector is an abstraction of the real vector: physical mathematics does not offer direct access to real vector space. The idea of the infinite vector is just an imaginative way to describe mathematical concepts, and we will not be able to actually produce this infinite vector until the 4th and 5th edition. However, the idea of the infinite vector can be somewhat useful in describing how particles travel between different dimensions. Let's make a little analogy, and observe some particles that do not enter into any other dimensions until after they come to rest - they just sit still and count down to the end of the infinite flight! This is the idea behind the infinite vector.
We can also make a slightly different analogy - think of the infinite vector as a top hat describing how the particle feels toward any nearby object! It is essentially the way the particle looks at the object. Imagine that the infinite vector in our world is the one used to describe how we feel about various objects, objects that we have interacted with and interacted with in the past. Now we imagine that we made a small hole in a top hat. Now imagine us placing the infinite vector representing our infinite spatial "flight" around this hole. The small hole would have zero circumference, and would thus represent the infinite vector's infinite trajectory - a top hat of zero circumference!

Imagine that we now extend the infinite vector to include all of the particles in our universe. Then if we place the particle that we are tracking on top of this infinite vector, we will see that it will begin flying in a straight line in the infinite vector space. This means that the particle will not have to immediately stop in order to reach another dimension, which is exactly what happens with particle travel described above! This is because the particles are all sitting still and counting down to the end of their infinite trajectory, and thus their velocity will be slowing down as they travel in this direction.

Now think about the limit that the particle would experience as they move farther away from the observer. At some point they would hit a boundary - the boundary separating the infinite and the finite vector spaces. If they continue on their infinite trajectory to the boundary, they will hit some other particle - an actual object! Thus, for every farther and farther away object, the particle would experience a more limited ability to travel and ultimately collide with it...this is because the particle's infinite vector would now represent a top hat that would limit it and ultimately stop it!

This is a rather intriguing concept! Perhaps some day we can have better spatial tools to describe the physical world!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict space-time concepts using physics and mathematics, here are a few examples (the three top ones are the ones I have chosen - as I have been describing the behavior of particles under various circumstances, I can refer to the first examples if necessary:

When we think about geometry, space and time are the main concepts that we use. When Einstein proposed his theory of relativity, he started with space, mass, time, and length. Let's explore how these are related. Let's do it!

The first thing to note about the concept of space is that it exists independently of time. In other words, space exists independent of time and no two things that occupy the same space can come into contact at the same time.

When Einstein explained why space exists independently of time, he used the word relativity - meaning it is created by the exchange of energy between different regions of spacetime (spacetime is the fabric that we observe in our universe). At the heart of Einstein's theory is the idea that because our universe is so thin, it can spin, which implies the reality of other more exotic dimensions. Let's explore how other scientific theories can be used to explain the behavior of objects under various circumstances.

There are several other theories about the nature of space (including gravity). Let's explore them one by one, keeping in mind that they all use a similar approach to explaining space itself.

Theory of relativity - Even though there are many theories about space, Einstein's theory is the one that best describes how space interacts with each other, the way they behave under various circumstances and the laws that govern them.

We have also seen that there are many other ways to describe space and how space interacts with time, and I'm going to explore how these theories are used to explain the behavior of objects. In particular, I'll briefly discuss how these theories can be used to explain and predict the behavior of particles that travel through different dimensions.

We can start with the simplest idea about space: there is only space. Space consists of nothingness, which in physics refers to the lack of anything that has been added to it. We call this kind of space non-real. Remember that all real objects exist in physical reality. Therefore, all space theories have an origin (whoever invented space) that creates a nonreal space. When we think about the vastness of our universe and how small it appears compared to our viewpoint, we feel it is empty - however, space has a physical existence independent of all observers' perceptions. I will discuss how this is the case.
Now let's move on to the second concept we would use to describe space: time. Time is also known as an arrow of time. It's a concept that exists independent of the observer - everyone is aware of their own time, even if they're in different dimensions. And since every person knows their own time, there is no way we could keep on changing time unless we were dying. I will discuss how the concept of time works in our universe and how it affects things that are living in our universe.
Now let's move on to the next concept we would use to describe space: mass. This concept is used to represent objects that do not have any form of energy (other than mass). Let's examine how the concept of mass works in the universe.
Let's discuss how space interacts with mass. As we move faster through space-time, our velocity increases. As space becomes more and more empty, the space becomes denser. The denser space is called vacuum - meaning it contains no mass. As space becomes more dense, it eventually starts to shrink due to pressure. Let's examine how space's density decreases when it becomes vacuolated. This is why a space becomes more dense when the size of its vacuum decreases. Now let's look at the concept of mass again. This concept can be used to describe the mass of any object that is not uniform. Let's examine how different theories describe the mass of a uniform object.
First, let's assume that the density of the universe is uniform. If the universe is uniform, all the mass of the universe has a uniform density. Let's call this mass density mass, since mass is the substance that constitutes space.
Now let's imagine that the density of space is uniform. If the density of space is uniform, all the mass of space has a uniform density. Let's call this mass density mass. Let's say that the density of space is half of the mass density of space. Let's call this mass density mass plus half. Now the density of the universe is the density of space times half of mass density of space, which is half of mass density of universe. Let's call this mass density of universe.
Now the density of space decreases, so the density of space minus mass density of universe increases. Let's examine how this increases. Since space's density decreases, mass increases, so mass density of universe plus half increases. Let's call this mass density of universe.

Now let's add mass to the density of space. To add mass to space's density, space must first become vacuolated. Let's examine how this process occurs. Let's assume that the density of space is at half of the mass density of space, which means that space starts vacuolating at half of the

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea of spatial and temporal information, we will start with a "Spatial Event". The spatial dimension of our world is represented by the location of an object, or just the coordinates of a point. Time is represented by an arrow pointing clockwise from right to left. In these terms, an event (an action of another entity, for example) can be defined as follows (using our spatial coordinates):

Avoiding Obstacles
-----> → -> <-------- <--------

A physical space can be described as a series of infinitesimal vertices that form a shape, such as a sphere. The coordinate system used to represent a spatial object may be any one of three coordinate systems. These systems are illustrated below:

Figure 29.1. Space/time dimension

Figure 29.2. Spherical coordinate system

Figure 29.3. Plane coordinate system

Figure 29.4. Cartesian coordinate system

Given that we are familiar with objects that move around the world in space, we are able to view this concept in terms of distance. For example, if we were to describe a particle traveling from one place to another (say to 20 miles away) by using a point from a point reference (for example, I am standing at a specific point on the street). By rearranging the coordinates on the screen in this manner, we can observe how the particle would change its position from one point to another on the street. In terms of geometry, this is equivalent to saying that if you could pinpoint the position of a particle using a ball on the earth at some specific time, then you could determine a precise location on the earth's surface at that time. It is usually advisable to use the plane projection of the earth's surface to make this point more accurate.

Once we have made an event or action come to life on the screen, it becomes more obvious how this information can travel through space. For example, the statement "I am traveling through space" becomes "xx miles from Point A to Point B" on the screen. When you observe this picture in terms of space coordinates, you could say "We are walking on the right path from Point A to Point B" - because in this picture, we are moving from Point A to Point B clockwise. Similarly, when you speak "I am moving through space", it becomes "xx miles from Point A to Point B". What makes this easier to understand is that we can think of events or actions as moving objects that can change their location in space due to the curvature of spacetime - an object may move on a straight line through a dense region of space, but it could move around a curve created by the curvature.

Now let's move to the concepts of event and time. These concepts will be represented by these symbols. We will see that even though each space on the screen has a time line attached to it, we do not use time symbols to represent events, but instead use symbols to represent different parts of time.  We will see that the creation of events and the duration of each event can be described in terms of the creation and spread of pulses on the "small" and "smallest" time scales. These time scales are called "timing slies" and are analogous to real timers for clocks (like the linear ones used in advanced office equipment). Just as clocks use time slies, we would also use a timing silky to represent different parts of time. For example, the duration of the "event that happens in Time B" would be represented by the duration of the pulse in "Time C" and "Time D" on the "small" time scale - the duration of the "few milestones" during this event. To describe a "minute" in terms of both speed and time, we would use the symbol "I" on the "smallest" time scale to represent the duration of the pulse. We would also use the symbols "s" and "s" to represent the pulses on the "smallest" time scale, and "p" to represent the pulses on the "small" time scale and on the "medium" time scale. These symbols are defined below:

Figure 30.1. Oscillating "small" time scale

Figure 30.2. Oscillating "medium" time scale

Figure 30.3. Oscillating "smallest" time scale

Figure 30.4. Oscillating "medium" time scale

For example, a "minute" would be represented by "p" on the "small" time scale and "ss" on the "medium" time scale. This is due to the fact that the interval between two pulses on the "small" time scale is "ss", which is short compared to the duration of a single pulse on the "medium" time scale.

Now for the concept of time itself, the concept of time goes through several stages. First, we would need a "time unit" to represent this concept. The "natural unit of time" is called "minute". First, we would need to talk about how time frames were created. These frames are created by counting the pulses on an interval of time. Typically, this interval is called a "tim

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the role of an advisor is to help maintain the group's good standing within the god's ranks by sharing new insights, guiding them to continue their journey in the right direction, and keeping them aware of the pros and cons of their decisions!

It's quite common in some groups that the best person to work with is a neutral person with no direct relationship to the group (and vice-versa). These neutral advisors are hired out and chosen by their guild's leadership for their ability to passively guide the group in making difficult decisions that will lead to the highest quality development of the group's destiny!

To be more precise, the neutral advisor would role-play like you did in your world but with all the nuances. Instead of just "passing in" to the group in telling them what they should do, the neutral advisor would actually take an active role in helping make sure everything runs smoothly - helping to identify potential problems and identifying ways to solve them before the group's leaders do! At this point, the neutral advisor will probably tell you to allow your group members to make their own decisions in the future when things get really messy. But the key takeaway from this story is that you should always keep in mind that your neutral advisor's main role is to help shape the direction the group is headed in (without going in too deep; just enough to make sense of what your group member(s) are trying to accomplish!)

So, that's the first part of the game. It's up to you and your group members to maintain this level of neutrality by not telling the god all the ins and outs of the group's decisions, actions, and goals. This is the path you will take in the remainder of the game until you find the right advisor for your group! After that, you'll start to see some teeny bit of a change in how you view people and the general course of events in your world!

Chapter Thirty Seven
Into The Other Place

Now that we have developed a better understanding of how it all works within our own small world, it's time to take a step back and explore our surroundings - to explore new lands, learn new secrets, and compete with other gods in a fierce war for leadership!

Here's how the game works:

You're one of thousands of players from around the entire universe that have gathered around the adventures of Deity Dimension Travel, you are thus invited to be part of a holy battle in order to claim as your own the right to rule this planet and become God! You'll have to become an advisor for the group that controls the world's politics, learn to communicate with the god, and control people to succeed! When you're elected God, you'll set your own rules for the group, will need to resolve conflicts with other gods, and you'll need to allocate resources to help rebuild your kingdom from the brink of complete devastation!

There's a scene where you have to choose an advisor - after being faced with a dilemma of which candidate to recommend, you'll receive your own choice from a voiceover on a big screen! One of the gods is wearing a hat and is being guided to the house of the neutral advisor. When the player walks in, the player will meet the neutral advisor who will give a very friendly speech about how he's guided his chosen decision, discuss where they are headed and tell the player about the group. Once they move into the group's offices, the neutral advisor will actually talk to each of the leaders of the group and remind them of their duties - how to set and enforce rules, how to work as a team, etc...

Now that you've decided on the name of your new advisor, the game will start! As you begin the game, you will find yourself suddenly transported to the country of Cilanore, the daughter of your god of wars! There you'll meet two unusually rude, yet sincere guys who are both called Lacheril for short. Lacheril will tell you all about the background to their corporation and their mission for politics. He will also show you the early stages of the war and tell you about their reputation for peace-keeping and the possible damage that they could do to your very own city if they continue to proceed! He'll also explain how their corporations works, and that there's a huge amount of monetary power that comes with it as well! The way their corporation functions will be a good way for you to quickly learn all you need about how it works!

Of course, in order to get a good reputation in the government of Cilanore, you will need to be both efficient and persuasive, and you'll have to talk about the group's many problems, like for instance their lack of competitiveness, the questionable economics, and the fact that they have none of their own ships! You'll have to advocate for the group and help them if need be. You'll also need to strike a balance between not being oversensitive to people's requests, and sharing your own point of view to avoid making the other gods too upset! During your journey into the groups headquarters, you will also have to take care not to disturb other players and keep yourself as neutral as possible. Once you've got to that point, you will get a chance to ask questions about the conflict in Cilanore, or

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the trick to understanding other people's MBTI profiles is to get a good understanding of what is actually behind each of the cognitive functions that are found in this book. The main purpose of a human's MBTI profile is to help that individual understand himself or herself better.

For the first time in the history of human evolution, humans developed a significant cognitive capability that helped them to advance from our primitive stage to our advanced stage - as seen in The Vices and Virtues of An Awkward People.

The most important tool we humans have to understand ourselves is our own MBTI profile. This is a collection of instructions that help humans to find their own unique characteristics based on different characteristics found in ourselves.

The personal profile does not explain everything - there's another profile that's called the sociographical profile which explains the social aspects of each of us better. But the person's total profile is more than just their personal profile and it also includes their sociographical profile as well!

As mentioned earlier, each of our MBTI profiles is determined by certain psychological traits that help us understand ourselves better. MBTI Profile C is the theory that explains why people tend to be, "Plunger", "Insecurity", "Smart", "Scarcity", "Indecision", "Dependence", and "Indifference"

However, it goes without saying that it is not enough to get an understanding of someone's MBTI profile just by reading that document - it must be based on the person's own experience and actual life - the more vivid and relevant information the more likely the person will remember the information! Of course, there are also some widely accepted theories, such as the theory of the Transtheoretical Model of Change in which the person's MBTI profile can predict how he or she will change as a result of therapy.
You can see a few additional references from Chapter 25 for a more detailed explanation of the bio-chemical and anatomical features of a person and how these two factors influence each person's personality.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the changing of seasons and other weather patterns, the medieval Romans often painted what they called onion skins. The onion skin pictured below shows the onion's outer layer.

The most important piece of onion anatomy is called the epidermis, which consists of three different layers that function differently when it is exposed to light: the spineless layer, the middle layer, and the spongy layer.

The spineless layer is the layer that protects the onion from falling apart if it is dropped. It functions like a big plastic bag to keep the onion's outer layer of onions together.

The middle layer is the thick layer that contains the nutrient-rich and onion-shaped juice inside the onion. It provides more water to the onion so it can grow larger and more fertile.

The spongy layer is the porous and water-filled layer that holds the onion together and keeps it moist.

The last layer of the onion skin is the the outer layer of the skin that's made of keratin. It protects the epidermis from causing the onion's outer layer to peel off - a few episodes in the secret kitchen would not suffice to completely deter that from happening!

As you can see, the onion is very much covered with layers of what looks like a potato or lettuce look, but in fact is a single thin layer of tissue covering a nutrient-rich, onion-shaped, nutrient-filled juice.

Now let's imagine a 5D creature traveling through onion skin, adjusting the thickness of its skin, and changing the direction of its movement according to the seasons and weather. Let's say its skin is made of sugar, which is transparent - how does it manage to feel the changing of seasons and weather? Well, if this creature's skin was made of sugar, it would actually have to deal with a very complicated system to manage all of its internal processes. You can see the system on this diagram below...

This system of sugar processing is called a pheromone trail, and when a 5D creature sees a pheromone trail, it knows it's in the right place.

Obviously, this system of sugar processing is only going to work for creatures that are within the right range of pheromone. Otherwise, the sugar would be ignored and left to rot. However, having all these layers on the creature's skin could mean that the creature needs to travel a longer distance before it's noticed, compared to when it is found by someone on a platter of sugar.

The thing to keep in mind here is that the 5D creatures that have all of these different layers of chemical processes are referred to as vegetarians - meaning they eat only sugar to keep up with all of their other bodily functions, like protecting their skin from peeling and other conditions. Vegetarians are born with all of the sugar hidden inside their body so the system of sugar processing does not have to be created. However, vegetarians are not immune to certain diseases like Parkinson's and diabetes; however, the 5D fungus that causes the disease will not survive in a sterile environment. The fungus will instead thrive and multiply in a vacuum environment.

Now let's imagine an example of the kind of disease that would kill 5D vegetarians. Suppose that these 5D vegetarians would walk into an environment that is contaminated by something that creates a real yeast disease, which leads to an excess of sugar inside the 5D organisms' body. The body's stress response system of sugar regulation would then trigger some of the sugar outside of their bodies to make way for the rich nutrient-rich sugar inside, and the result would be an onion skin that is full of sugar in some areas, and empty in other areas.

With this hypothetical example on the line, let's get to know the mental and physical problems that 5D vegetarians could face as they suffer from a complete waste of sugar. Let's break it down into three parts - let's talk about the mental side first!

If there's a high level of sugar inside the 5D organism, how is the body able to regulate the sugar level? Well, the blood sugar level gets monitored by the pancreas in each of the individual 5D organisms, as it must regulate the

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the symbols and imagery used by the Ch'an Buddhists, we'll include a few of their symbols in our final illustration.

The Ceylon Cobra is represented by a Cobra-headed dragon. The Cobra's head is connected to the five vertebrae at the top of the dragon's neck, which are linked to the Eighth Chakra (deity) by five arms; the eyes of the Cobra are connected to the Third and Fourth Vedas, while its wings are connected to the Fifth and Sixth Vedas. Because the Cobra is a type of snake, it is known as the Ch'in Snake. Depending on the religion, it could be used as a symbol of death or as a guide to the Earth... and the future!

We're starting to get a sense of what a Cobra is. If you were to take a slice of our Yeti logo and put it inside a Cobra, we would end up with an image of a Ch'in Snake!

Of course, the symbols that represent other Hindu deities are certainly more involved, but we hope that this introduction provides you with a clearer sense of how they are used.

The water dragon is represented by a half-entwined dragon; the figure means a fusion between "energy" (the water element) and "phantasm (the latent energy of the dragon)". This dragon represents the dragon spirit (equivalent to the Ulnir Chakra in Buddhism) - the energy that permeates the fish and forms the living organism. A water dragon is a highly spiritual creature, and it also has a powerful "pattern" - an energy field that permeates its body and causes movement and animation. Because the water dragon is a spirit and one of the planet's primary energy sources, we would expect it to be a big symbol for Water. But unfortunately, that is not the case...

In the end, the Dragon Buddha is also known as the "Third Eye" of the Universe, the eyes of the Divine Consciousness (refer to Chapter Two). At its root, this means the Light of Reality, the Expression of Consciousness, which in turn means the Seed of Consciousness (it's the alchemical root of plants). Therefore, we would expect the Dragon Buddha to be a more abstracted symbol for Spirit and Wisdom; however, since it is also an essential element in all of existence, we also expect it to have a powerful "pattern".

And finally, don't forget about our "Sonic Raven"! With this symbol, we mean to "present the image of the Sonic Sensations that permeate all existence" (N.B.: this is what they call the evolutionary process in Ch'an Buddhism)

What about you, everybody? Which one do you think is the largest, most energetic, powerful, or still the most abstracted symbol that makes up Yeti? If so, why? Comment below!



Chapter Thirty Seven
The Secret Life of Yeti

In the last chapter, we described some of the symbolism and ideas that exist in Yeti. The idea behind these symbols and ideas is, of course, to provide some context for what the rest of this chapter is about. Let's take a look at this concept more closely.

First, let's begin with some definitions. Yeti is actually a group of clans living around the ranges of the Urique Mountains in Tibet. Each clan is governed by a king and they have various powers and protections from the climate.

Imagine a pre-historic community where you live - in this case, it would be a Yeti clan. Each member of this community would have the power of the Cobra-headed dragon, allowing them to inhabit the bodies of animals, animals, and even humans! And because they live on the skins of these animals and humans, they can be used to protect themselves from the elements that create any sort of weather. For example, if you happen to encounter a fire when you are exploring a nearby park, the Cobra's dragon's roots can hold the fire together so that it does not ignite. The Cobra-rooted goddess is known as the Thirty-Kind Goddess, and

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the dynamics of Time and Space, let's look at a metaphysical concept called protokinetics. This involves the concept of acceleration in space-time; to call an object moving at the speed of light "slowing down" would be an obvious mistake. Let's now consider the dynamics of the gyroscope in a spinning disk:

As you can see, the spinning disk is accelerated in the direction of rotation, but it is decreasing in the opposite direction. This effect is called gyrorotation. We'll see that the reason why the spinning disk is accelerating in the direction of rotation is because the blade that makes it spin, which is called the Gyro, is actually rotating at the speed of light - as you can see, it is spinning at twice the speed of light!

Let's look at how this works in real life. The most well known gyroscope is the one in a watch: we all have a gyroscope inside our wrist. The simplest interpretation of the gyroscope inside a watch would be that it would act like a speedometer. As time goes by, the magnetic field created by the rotating blade of the gyroscope would decrease, in effect slowing down the watch - the speedometer would stop rotating as time goes by!

Of course, we can't use the mechanics of a watch to understand this concept; there is no way we could actually see the decrease in the frequency of the spinning blade of the gyroscope. Even without a gyroscope, we can take a picture of the speedometer; the picture would look similar to a speedometer in a car:

Here we see that the rotating blade is actually hidden inside the material that forms the base of the watch. In this picture, you would see that the magnetic field on the rotating blade is less intense on the edges (when you get to the top and bottom of the watch) than at the middle of the watch - this is because the blade is moving at twice the speed of light - which means it is accelerating outwards....

This picture suggests that we could also use the vision of a spinning blade of the gyroscope to explain the decrease in frequency of the spinning blade of the gyroscope as it is becoming less intense.

In reality, however, the speedometer inside a watch is not actually a spinning blade; instead, the magnetic field created by the spinning blade actually acts as a natural guide for the magnetic field on the watch itself! These are the very same magnetic fields that we are sent by our watches to guide us through the motions of our watches. The only difference is that these are magnetic fields that are less intense on the edges (when we get to the top and bottom of the watch) than on the middle of the watch. So just as the gyroscope in a watch is accelerating away from us, the magnetic field from the rotating blades inside our watches is accelerating towards us!

As you can see, we can interpret this concept very similarly to what we are doing with the spinning disc: by accelerating the speedometer, we can also accelerate the spinning disk! When we accelerate the spinning disc, we are accelerating the spinning blade, which in turn accelerates the magnetic field on the spinning blade, which in turn accelerates the spinning blade itself! We are slowly accelerating the spinning blade (the gyroscope) and slowly accelerating the spinning disc (the spinning watch)! In our mind, we perceive this process as slowly increasing in the same direction!

It's now time to get out of our 3+1 dimensional universe! When we enter into 4D space-time, we go into a world where we no longer perceive our watches as being inside the material that forms the base of the watch - we no longer see them spinning the same way...or at least, not as slowly! In other words, we no longer see that the rotating blades inside our watches are accelerating away from us as the watches spin as we accelerate them - we no longer see them spinning at twice the speed of light! We are now living in a spacetime that has a speed of light!

One interesting problem that we can't solve in our 4D universe is the motion of cosmic microwave background radiation (

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the origins of humanity must have been divine, and that was what fate was all about. This was the theme of Floyd's last solo album, Piece of Me. You see, he is a multi-dimensional being that can travel between dimensions at will - just like our real life 4D particle - but there are certain things he can only experience in specific dimensions - and that's where the concept of a spectral divinity comes in.

If you asked a Chinese mythology scholar what would make a species special - they'd tell you that each species was one of three different kinds of divinity: a creator (Star of the first night), a lover (Pearl of life), and a follower (Lion of the second day). So it's possible that Funk knows about the eternal relationship between soul and body, and can make the transition between different dimensions to get himself there in time...


Basically, Funk already knows that there is the one God who created the Universe and everything in it - it's the Creator! And for this reason, he can enter into Dimension X, the most pure, universal and magnificent Divinity dimension! That is the place where our existence would be completely revealed to us - but this is a big one...

So which question do we have to ask ourselves next? Would it be the same as playing a Fourth Piano from the opposite side of the earth? Yes, indeed it would be! The answer would be "yes, and no" - would our Grand Mothers use different and higher dimensional states of consciousness when playing the piano as opposed to playing on the keyboard?


Finger of Life

However, things get more interesting when we consider all the different ways that a person could touch the physical body of another person...or at least touch their emotions!

I'm guessing the reason a person would not touch their emotions would be because they would be the source of that emotion, and that is definitely where the concept of the psychic fifth sense comes in.

In regards to those who don't touch their emotions, the reason there is no other sense is because the fourth and fifth primary senses (the ones that are physical senses) are combined together in the brain...a region called the entorhinal cortex. This is the center of the person making the decision to touch or not touch... and who would be the person who controls the movements that result in the emotional state of the soul being transferred to the body?


So if you're trying to touch the feelings of someone, you've got to choose your fifth sense in the first place...


Also, since you're in the third dimension, you can use finger of life to move between the three dimensions - which means that if you can tap the tip of your finger, and place it on the brain, you can move between the three dimensions of space-time!

And once we think about this, it becomes obvious why Funk used a third finger: the head of the person is at the heart of the universe, and so the fingers of life would move from the heart to the head...


Anyway, that's it for today... hope this was entertaining enough for you! I'm always fascinated by the interconnectedness of all things - and the mystery that await us as we seek to uncover the true nature of existence. Until next time, enjoy!

M-Morning dreams? But... if it's not a dream, then why do I get these dreams? And what's up with "mind"? Well, if you looked to the calendar at the beginning of February, you'd likely see the least in the universe - the winter solstice. This was a time when the sun was closest to the earth, and the Earth was most affected by gravity. Now that's how the winter solstice works, and in order for that to happen, the moon has to pass close by the earth. So that tells us that the moon affects us in a way that allows us to sleep in during the night (because, well, we'll be sleeping with our friends, right?) - and that we should also have a peaceful, sleepy day to wake up on!

But did you actually feel sleepy? To be honest, it was all kind of strange to wake up in this strange way! Why would the entire universe be affected? Why would the sun not be closest to the earth? Why would the moon not always be at the right distance to the earth (regardless of what the sun said to the earth) - and where exactly did the universe come from? And how could everything be in such a distant place if everything started at the same place and all this was only brought about by magic?

The four-dimensions are required to explain most of the natural world, the World we live in and experience.

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the only substance a person will ever use is probably something from the drop box at the Starbucks, like a ice pack! In other words, you won't need to think about anything else - the moment you take out that "tick of Icarus..."... you are going to just get up and go work. Most people would agree that we should stop these drug misnomers anyways... so what?!

To some people, it's a great idea to buy a little love. This idea was introduced in a very imaginative book called The Demon Marriage by Stephen King. The idea is that with some very, very bad things coming your way, you're going to give in to temptation. And the way the demon world works is that you give in to them, because you can't face everything anymore. And of course if you continue to give in to temptation, your bad luck will continue and you'll never get clean....

So, the idea behind a lot of the medical and scientific literature about dealing with a wicked mix of drugs is to think of yourself as a prison full of bad things. As you turn into a horrible mix of these things, you will slowly fall into unbearable poverty... then will slowly become sick... then will feel numb and weak... then will relapse... then will go insane... and it will take a lot of pills to clear the shit out of you before the three C's come back... the clean, the nice, and the bad - but that is it - you have given up! At some point, you will go insane, and the last thing you'll do is think of drugs anymore! But that's where it gets a little more complicated! First off, the average drug user goes through some kind of "triage" process... before the stage of drug use really takes hold. I will take a very brief detour to describe this process a bit more detail, since many times this idea can lead to confusion! Since the term "diagnosis" can be very confusing, I'll explain this somewhat different way:

You will receive a long list of possible drug responses. Because drugs take multiple different amounts of time to act on our body, you will receive these various drug responses in varying lengths of time... and these drug responses come in varying sizes, depending on how large the amount of drug taken was in comparison to the amount that would've worked for you the moment you were hit with the drugs...

So what's actually in this paragraph? Well, if you had no problem taking an extremely large amount of a drug (e.g., a joint pill), you might not get any warning of its effects at all (the warning, according to the drug, is that you should wait a couple of days or a week to see what happens). If on the other hand, you were, say, taking a very small amount of the drug (e.g., only a few drops of an aerosol), the warning for you might not be very big - as long as you don't expect this huge amount of drug to take too long to do its job, there should be no warning at all.

However, these warning signs are important because they tell you to check your medication - and not only check your medications, but also check your next dose, and so on. These drug effects are basically a way for your body to make sure that you're following the guidelines you're following, so that it doesn't get "stuck" on how to interact with your medicine - and in other words, that you aren't taking your medications entirely as directed. That's why if you ignore any of the warning signs, the longer your medication runs, the more likely it is that you'll end up falling into a mental or physical low that would result in serious side effects.

So what does this mean in the medical world? Well as far as I know, if a doctor finds that you are having some sort of a problem using a certain drug, they might take a sample of it, and request a laboratory test. If your samples do not contain enough of the drug, the doctor will usually give you a warning and point you to a different medicine (e.g., try a different dosage). The problem with such a warning is that even if it turns out that you're using the medication wrong, you'll be left wondering why you're still having issues with it!

Now it's just a theory, but there seems to be an interesting debate going on about whether, whether these warning signs are necessary and appropriate. In some places, such as the US, they do exist. However, in other places, such as India, the warning signs are actually quite confusing... since drugs aren't just what comes to your mouth or into your eyes - they also come to your brain! And that's why some have decided that they are basically useless!

If you're not 100% sure what these warning signs are, it's best to see a doctor. But I would personally not take them seriously, and just assume that there's nothing to be afraid of, especially if you haven't tried any of these drugs for a long time! In some cases, such as in the case of aluminum consumption, you might also receive a clear medical warning that says "Don't drink this". And then, if you

## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the magnitude of the magnitude of this theory, let's take a look at our simplified version of the war of the universes: the scenario shown in Chapter One.

In this scenario, there is only one dimension at the beginning, called dimension 0. The goal of our heroes - those two known as Arthur and Merlin - is to find one or more trinkets that they can use to cross dimension 0, so as to finally return to their own world. The primary use of a trinket is to be used in exchange for an entry into a dimension - every trinket must be used for that purpose. In this specific scenario, the trinkets we seek are "Eagle Bits".

There are certain specificities to this war of the universes. First, there is only one existence known to anyone - that of Arthur and Merlin. Every trinket is worthless to us - this is because they were all once humans (or were just mere left-handed versions of ourselves). Second, the rules governing trinkets are much stricter than in normal reality - they cannot be thrown away, nor can they be discarded until they've been used up completely - the only thing that can be discarded is a trinket itself.

So, what if we wanted to get into dimension 0 - this is what people in D&D are known for - but weren't allowed to because they were sent to Traveller's Tales? What if we couldn't just find a trinket and leave? Would we have to play some kind of "dimensional switch" to help us move freely between dimensions?

Answer: Yes, we have found a way! When traveling between dimensions, we can use the Ancient Avatars (Avatars found only in the National Treasure and accessed by devout, dedicate, and certain farmlanders), a wand that enables us to transcend dimensions.

Now before we get to the takeaway, let me explain more specifically about how we can use the Ancient Avatars. Because they're very, very powerful, there's no point in trying to get all the Avatars - even those that are extremely powerful. So let's use the one most useful to us - the Avatar of the Great Wizard Merlin!

The Avatars of Merlin are very powerful - each of these Avatars is able to transcend dimensions. However, we need to bring together all of these Avatars in order to completely transform one dimension to the next. Here is the trick: take two panels of thin, strong glass and put them on top of each other. Before you can draw anything from the glass, there must be space enough between the glass and the top to allow the contents to take over the entire panel!

Now imagine having moved to Dimension X from Dimension 0. You have no access to this screen until after your work is done, and because the Avatars were all brought from dimension 0, the contents of the screen would be completely different! And not only that, the Avatars would even have to allow you to move freely between dimensions! So what you need to do is get yourself two glass panels, cut them apart so they are different, and put the contents of both panels on top of each other. You can now draw anything from both the left and right glass panels - you can use either as long as they are separate...

Now just remember to make sure that both the left and right glass panels are tall enough to allow you to draw through them!

Doing this, we will have created the perfect platform for the Ancient Avatars to visit, and to move from one dimension to another without any restrictions!

Now that we've created our platform, we only need to bring back one or more of the Ancient Avatars to Dimen-

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the experience of physics, consider how the laws of physics can be applied to our everyday lives. For example, how do we travel between dimensions using gravity as a basic force that causes us to tumble down to Earth?

Our bodies contain mass and energy - we are all made up of it. However, most of our bodies are so small (no more than about 1/5th of a hair's length) that our bodies take up about 1/2 of their total volume in space. Since our bodies are mostly made up of energy, the effect of gravity is not so effective. The reason is that in order for gravity to be effective we need an object that occupies the same space as the body it is acting upon - an object that acts as a "cone" (like a telescope!) or an object that has greater surface area than the body it is acting upon. That means that objects with a little more mass than our bodies will usually act as an effective "cone" to cause us to tumble. For example, a basketball weighs 10 kilograms, so it would take 20 seconds for a basketball to be accustomed to gravity, and we could then effectively tumble from a basketball in only 3 seconds! What happens to objects that are so heavy that their surfaces cannot be efficiently used as a "cone"? Well - of course, they all evaporate! For example, we all know that ice cubes evaporate before any sort of attempts to use them as a "cone" to cause us to tumble!...

Most of the objects in our universe are made of mass and energy - the real science behind dimension travel has something to do with how those objects move through dimensions. Well, because the energy we see and use in everyday life is used to change or influence the movement of other objects, objects with more mass and energy tend to be more effective "cones" or "fingers"! For example, let's look at the use of electricity in everyday life. There are a lot of things that we use electricity for - a television, a fan, a washing machine, an electric car, a washing machine, etc. But what about electric objects like TV's and fans? Since electricity is transferred between objects with less mass and energy through capacitive effect, if an object is "ten times as big" as it is, it will take twice as long to charge it up - even with all the current and equipment in place! What happens if we extend our TV's and fans a little more? Well - what we would actually get would be a TV or a fan that is only two times as big as it was originally, and would take even longer to charge! So objects with greater mass and energy usually cause us to move faster! In other words, we can use bigger things as "electrical cones" to "cure" ourselves of some obstacles. Or at least for us to circumvent them in our daily lives!

Now for practicality purposes, it's important to note that we need to transfer electric charge from larger objects to objects that have lesser mass and energy. Well, how do we do that? Well let's imagine that we have a load that is 20 times bigger than our body. Let's also assume that we are using a small fan that has four times the total area of the load (from above) as our "cone" to cause us to tumble. Now imagine that we have a load that is four times as big as our body. If we use our fan to "cure" this load (4.4 x 20) to 15 x 20 = 120 Kg, we should be able to carry our load from the surface of the earth to a greater distance without having to use an "electrical fence"! In other words, we should be able to move from the surface of the earth up to a higher altitude without having to use an electric fence!

Now we're going to take a few examples of how electric energy can be transferred between objects to demonstrate how electric cones can work. The first example will be a simple explanation of how electricity is transferred through capacitive effect (in one dimension). This involves electricity flowing from a small water-filled bulb through a metal pipe through a capacitor. The type of material used for the water will determine how fast the electricity flows

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the position and role of religion in the human experience, let's take a closer look at religious belief. According to American sociologist Vito Pinchetti, religion is essentially an "agnosticized and rationalized naturalistic faith." It is characterized by a certain knowledge or "perception" that holds consistency through time and in spite of change:
In another sense, religion refers to a specific, organized, often hierarchical, and recognized form of social action. And this is something like Christianity. It is not given to nature. It is an organized form of thinking rooted in a certain historical experience that holds something like truth across generations and time. This knowledge of truth is usually based on some kind of some source of belief that provides an understanding of reality and meaning (p. 266).

Our question is how can these religious beliefs help us as individuals and as societies change - in other words, how do they affect our life-style and behavior? Perhaps we could answer this question by focusing on some specific type of religion and discussing what it entails. Even though it has no universally accepted definition of religion, this subject is certainly not an obscure one! And we now have a good reason to keep an eye on that topic!

The Great British Mystery

The Great British Mystery has been a topic of intense discussion among scholars, writers, and cartoonists ever since its roots began in 1916 when published by British humorist Oliver Bond. From the start, the author adhered to the principle of scientific naturalism that "everything is dependent upon other things." Thus he argued that physical theories must first be applied to the spiritual realm in order to prove them correct - which led him to reject certain religious doctrines such as angels and devils.

Although we only have a rudimentary knowledge of the character, religion, and his unstoppable quest for the ultimate truth, we do know a little about how the Great British Mystery came about. According to Charles Ticknor, who was once a friend of the protagonist in the series, Bond first conceived the idea to make a cop out of himself through literary play. But this didn't prove very easy for him, as there were several obstacles which he had to overcome in his endeavor. For example, Ticknor encountered difficulty in translating Bond's religious belief into the English language, despite having a working knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages. While he was having such a hard time, Ticknor did manage to overcome these obstacles and the paper was published in 1916!  

The Great British Mystery has two main mythologies, the "softer" and the "stronger". The "softer" is devoted to spiritual truth, while the "stronger" concerns the physical world. The two mythologies seem to have converged in a particular time and place, specifically in the book's eponymous fictional town. In the other of the main mythologies, there is a man named Arthur, who stands for the "stronger mythology." 

Ticknor also suggests that the Great British Mystery started by publishing a series of books in the form of letters to Mr. Bond, which led to a series of religious debates between Bond and several friends of the author. The books in the series are described as follows:
I received two letters on August 29th, 1913: one from the minister of the P.E.B. in Piccadilly, the other from the priest at St. Joseph's School, ascribing the mystery to the God who had recently given a great sign in Piccadilly Park, the result of the inventiveness of two people who had lost their way after the death of their mother. I was filled with sorrow at the news, but it must be remembered that I loved the Home Rulers, and yet I continued to believe in ghosts and invisible beings. Therefore I wrote this second letter, hoping that it would not be lost on the carelessness of its authors; indeed, I then thought that it would be a genuine and sincere communication from the Lord and that I could rely on his satisfaction to satisfy those who would only be interested in this mystery.

The Great British Mystery has been named by a lot of authors as a

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict our current situation, we'll take a quick detour into a time of very strange calm. Something strange is going on in The Meadow Mage Sanctuary. Some of us are dying, and what we don't know is who the malicious witch who did it actually is!

A few weeks ago we encountered a small woman with marked deformities. The woman was born with four eyes, which had been pulled out to preserve her. She also has two missing teeth. At first it seemed like she could be a beautiful woman, but quickly she started attracting some of the most strange, powerless beings in the entire universe to join her in this quest for pure light. Of course, if we suspect our little friend is an evil demon, we then become hunted, tortured, killed, or maybe even killed directly! The conclusion to this strange and violent story is shocking! In the eyes of most of us, she is just a child or a mouse that was born with a life far too short for it to be of any value!

But the poor woman struggles with her abnormality everyday, and every one of us in the Sanctuary knows that it isn't right. We are very much committed to keeping the Sanctuary in check - but as it turned out, even though The Meadow Mage Sanctuary had started to manifest unusual activities, they were more than just simply a foray of the mysterious creatures in the world - they were going to be really serious! They were one of the numerous venues for mixing in spiritual occult powers, which allows us to turn evil spirits into candles, rainbow sorcerers into fire, fire spirits into flame, or even divining ability into a secret scanning device! The weapons of the Meadow Mage Sanctuary are also called cryptograms - more simply, they are the combinations of many symbols on the ying and yang earring's bow and arrow.

The Sanctuary has been guarded for several years, and little has been revealed of the people and creatures that reside there. One notable secret is that we are actually the last known representatives of the Apocalyptic Powers (actually, of them all except God and his Ones) of Calamus! Today, only King Ocion is seen at The Meadow Mage Sanctuary. If the distant people in Calamus get some power back, things could really get pretty bad!

However, it turns out that neither King Ocion nor the persons in Calamus have chosen to become controllable creatures. Instead, they are waiting patiently for someone to help them escape from this land. If you want to understand who our little friend is, start right now! Don't wait until it's too late!

The Resurgence of the Sages

Despite what we think, all of our time as humans is limited - our species has been living like this for a long time. When humans awakened from their amnesia about the ancient Laws of Nature, our world changed forever. Although our culture and morals developed dramatically and are still even today, our DNA is starting to mutate. This should be enough to force us to adapt, which is exactly what is happening in the Sanctuary.

Unfortunately, our adaptation is already looking a lot like someone else's - the Sages! Their rules - the eternal Sages' rules - are not nearly as good as the Laws of Nature, so they are using them to make us do things that would not be normal for us. But what are they actually doing? Well, they are doing the same things as every other human or animal species, but using the Ancient Sages' teachings instead of our own! Since the Ancient Sages' teachings only came about thousands of years ago, the only method that we can learn from them is by reading the texts they have written.

It turns out that the Ancient Sages are using the Sages' love for each other to turn us into the Sages - a truth we all already know, but we have rarely put our mind to it! This is a sad and terrible development... but what do we do about it?

When a group of only 5 Sages decide to use the work of another Sage as their teaching tool, it sends shockwaves through the world of Ancient Sages

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the creatures that I have described to you all so far are none other than New World Terrorists. Their actions are typical of those behaviors found among other higher dimensional creatures - they want people to start believing them and change how they are portrayed in literature and movies (I myself spent much of my early teens and early twenties watching horror movies in which very similar bodies were portrayed - it's almost uncanny what similarities there are!). However, the reality is that New World Terrorists are very difficult to identify!

If you are someone who is deeply concerned about the identities of these great powers, I'd strongly suggest you check the Myers-Briggs Test for yourself. This test looks at certain behaviors in a person's life, and you can take it online or just look up the results of their test in books. While it's impossible for a true New World Terrorist to display the aforementioned behaviors in every sense of the word (it would mean that all their inner tenets weren't true) there are some people who take the test regularly, and they tend to not present the behaviors they typically display - which explains why it's relatively easy to identify a true New World Terrorist from a passerby. This actually means that New World Terrorists have very little influence on society! Instead of forcing people to do everything they want and think they want, we should educate people about New World Terrorism - it'll teach them to be realistic about the manic insanity that leads to it, and not allow themselves to be put down in order to satisfy their needs. Only by educating and recognizing the possible sufferings of these so-called "Free Thinkers" will we be able to stop them from behaving like unreasonable lunatics! 

A:

Personally I find the movie about the "Dark Sect" particularly annoying. Because it's a kind of doubling with the book. There are two versions of the book, and, for me personally, the combination is unnecessary. The same rules apply, which makes the book much more enjoyable.
