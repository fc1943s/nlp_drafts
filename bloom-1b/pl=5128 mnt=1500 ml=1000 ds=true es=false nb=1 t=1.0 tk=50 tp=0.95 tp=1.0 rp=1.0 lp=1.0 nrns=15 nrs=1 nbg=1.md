 In other words, a deity could enter into Dimension X and then travel to Dimension Y without affecting its time.

So what exactly are the dimensions? Well, according to physics, there are four-dimensional spaces and four-dimensional time. Additionally, there are four-dimensional "spaces and times" that are "outer" to our universe. This means that we live in the inner or "real" 4D universe. All this is described by a mathematical model called spacetime, which is a very simple mathematical description of everything in our universe.

So let's say you wanted to know how a 4D universe works, and you wanted to find out if there are any other hidden dimensions that we are not aware of. Well, you can ask yourself the questions that we used to make up our stories about the hidden universes, and then look up the answers for yourself! That would take a little while, but it's worth the effort; a) it would give you a little insight into the universe and your own place in it, and b) it would let you have a better understanding of the rest of the 4D universe.

A:

The simplest explanation for why this happens is the fact that there are not enough photons to be at the origin. As the photon moves a larger distance it experiences more acceleration. Eventually it becomes negative energy and cannot be considered a physical object. It can't actually be the origin, but it can make it so if the photon moves the same distance it has to experience more acceleration. So what happens is that the origin is eventually moved out of the Universe.
In order to explain the physics more precisely, imagine this picture:

In this picture, there are two particles: the photon, which is moving in a direction normal to space, and the point that is supposed to be the origin, which is in the center of the image. In the center of the image, there is a source of energy, which generates a field of electromagnetic radiation that is sent outward from the point. The other particle, which has not changed in mass or energy, is the point at which we take the picture.
The problem is that the initial position of the origin in this image changes. In other words, after being absorbed by the image, the origin moves out of the image.
After the image absorbs the point, the photon starts to move in a direction normal to space, while the point in the center of the image gets absorbed. The point in the center of the image remains at zero energy, while the photon continues to travel.

The question is: is there a way that the origin could remain at zero energy? The answer is that, for reasons that I cannot explain, the photon moves in a direction opposite to the direction of the origin when it moves. This is because the origin, which is in the center of the image, is in the direction of the photon. In other words, after being absorbed by the image, the source of electromagnetic radiation does not send it straight back to the point in the center of the image. Instead, it sends it back in the opposite direction. This means that the zero energy point, which was in the center of the image, starts to move in a direction normal to space, while the origin starts to move in the opposite direction.
This is why, when the origin moves out of the image, the point in the center of the image stays zero energy. Since it is still in the center of the image, its energy does not change. However, due to the fact that its energy is in the opposite direction to the direction of the origin, when the origin moves in the opposite direction to its energy, the origin reaches a point that is also in the opposite direction to its energy. So the energy of the origin changes, and it now has negative energy. It cannot be the origin, so it is not a physical object.

A:

No, you cannot! To begin with, the photons travel with the speed of light and so don't slow down, which is the case with objects in space-time. What I mean by that is that the origin will be in the same state when it reaches the boundary and the point inside the image is in the opposite state. Of course the boundary moves at a speed faster than light, but, by the laws of physics, the origin will be in the opposite state when it enters the boundary but in the same state when it leaves it.
But I am not sure what is going on inside the image! As it is, the point is not a physical object. A photon which is moving with the speed of light won't be able to reach it. Of course the direction of the image will make it go faster and faster. So, you are right, I am not sure what is happening inside the image.
I would like to explain your question in a little more detail: Imagine that you look down on the point inside the image where there are three light sources in that direction. They will be radiating in the same direction. That means that the light sources will be emitting the same amount of energy. The point inside the image has no physical effect on the image, but when the light sources move through the image, they change the direction of the radiation of the points that they emit.
When the image absorbs the point in the center it sends out a light that will be traveling with the speed of light. So, the image is not changing anything. And, as you can see in the picture below, it can remain the same energy. But the radiation of the light source will change as it moves through the image. Of course the image will absorb it, but if we look at the direction of the radiation we can see that, when the image moves backwards, the radiation changes and becomes going backwards. This is the reason why it changes when the image is going backwards and the point in the center stays the same energy.
So, we see that the origin stays in the same state and the image changes its direction. But you have to wonder what is happening inside the image. It seems that the origin changes energy as it leaves the image and as it gets absorbed by the image. But inside the image the radiation of the point that is emitting the radiation changes, but it does not change the radiation of other points, because the radiation of a point is the energy of a light ray, which has a constant angular velocity. So, the point that is emitting radiation is moving with a constant angular velocity, which is going backwards.

As the origin moves backwards, it changes its direction of travel and as it gets absorbed by the image the light emitted by the point that was emitting light changes, and then it changes again. I think that you are confusing these two things and that the radiation of other points changes with the radiation of the point that was emitting radiation.
