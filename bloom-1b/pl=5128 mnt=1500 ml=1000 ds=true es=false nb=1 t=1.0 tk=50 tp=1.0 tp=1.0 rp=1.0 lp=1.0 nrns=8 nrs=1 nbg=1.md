 So it's no wonder they are sometimes called "free spirit" beings!

In short, if you want to explore what happens if things in different dimensions collide, you need to consider how objects move in different dimensions to account for space-time and time dilation.

I hope this helped you understand more about the physics of dimension travel and how it helps us explore the world we live in.

A:

In physics, things change dimensions and spacespace-time is an example of this. Everybody believes they can travel between 3-D / 4-D spaces like between two different times but this is completely wrong.
It is also called "instantaneous change of space-time structure" it has nothing to do with dimensional space-time. It has nothing to do with instantaneous acceleration.  They are completely wrong in thinking that it is possible to go from one space-time to another.

The very term instantaneous could be wrong in this case because to say the instantaneous is like the particle could happen at any moment, because it is not possible to be instantaneous at space-time.  There are laws that make it possible to be the instantaneous and not the particle as it is not possible to be instantaneously at space-time.

Even if that particle could change its dimensionality between two dimensions, it cannot change its dimension until it enters into another dimension.  It cannot change the dimensionality at space-time and then change it again to the other dimension at any moment.

You can also get a lot more questions on the subject and I don't want to interrupt the discussion any longer.

A:

Some people would say that it's possible to go from one space-time (or time) to another. This is only true at absolute zero. Anything bigger would not be instantaneous. 
But let's remember the famous paradoxes of Newton and Einstein. The big picture that we use in everyday life does not break down.
It is also very easy to find an artificial example: the human body. It's not a 4-dimensional universe. We don't have 4-dimensional spacetime. It's possible to move between different dimensions. You can go from one 3-dimensional body to another. It will happen without affecting your present dimensions. And it will appear on another dimension.
If people have to travel back and forth between different dimensions, they will notice something very strange. Their dimension will always change in absolute time. Even after entering in the other dimension as time passes, its dimension will be different from the present one.
Let's have a closer look at it. Take your standard lab experiments and put them on youtube video. Let's have a look: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGbHlEfvLJU.
