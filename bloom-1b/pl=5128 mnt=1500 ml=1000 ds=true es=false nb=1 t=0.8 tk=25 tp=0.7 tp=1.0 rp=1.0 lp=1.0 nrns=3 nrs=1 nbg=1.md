 Ofcourse, there is a limit to how far a deity can travel - the dimensions they can enter into are limited to their own native dimensions.

So far so good. Let's take a look at some of these rules of physics that govern the movement of entities in 4D:

Force equals mass (or energy) times acceleration
Objects move in curved lines unless they are acted upon
Force and mass are related by the formula: force = mass * acceleration
Mass is equal to: mass = energy * volume
Energy is equal: energy = mass*time
Mass and energy are related by: mass = m * E
Mass = mass/volume
Energy = energy/volume

So, if you were an entity that was traveling through a 4-dimensional space-time (let's call it D), you would be moving in a curved line if you weren't acted upon. This means that the force that you're experiencing is the same force that you would experience if you had been in a 3+1-dimensional space and were moving in straight line. In other words: the force you are experiencing is proportional to the mass of the object and inversely proportional to its velocity. So, if your entity was traveling at a constant velocity of 10m/s, then the force it was experiencing would be equal to 10m/s^2.

However, if the entity was moving at a speed of 20m/s, the force would be 20m/s^2. This would mean that the entity is travelling at a rate of 20 times faster than the speed at which it was travelling before. This could be a problem for our 4-dimensional beings, as they would be travelling backwards as if they were travelling at the same rate as their native dimension. In order to avoid this problem, the 4-dimensional entity would have to be travelling at least as fast as its native dimension - which means it would have a velocity of at least 20m/s.

So, what if the 4D entity were travelling faster than its native dimensional space? Well, if it were travelling through a space that was infinitely higher than its dimensionality, then it would experience an infinite amount of force - the same as if it was traveling in a straight line! This would be a huge problem for 4-dimensional entities, as it would be impossible for them to travel through that space! Ofc, if they could travel through a higher dimensional space, then they could also travel through lower dimensional spaces, and vice versa.

So if we were to have a 4-Dimensional universe, then we would have an infinite variety of different dimensions - and an infinite range of velocities for our entities! Of couse, we don't have any idea how many dimensions there are, or how many different velocities there are. So we would need to use some sort mathematical formula to determine how many other dimensions there could be and how many velocities there could have! This is where the Einstein's Theory of Relativity comes in!

Einstein's theory is a mathematical theory that predicts how many more dimensions there might be, and how much higher dimensionality would be possible. This theory is based on the fact that spacetime is curved - this means that objects that are moving through it experience an acceleration. This acceleration is proportional (inverse) to the object's velocity, and inverse-proportional (in inverse) to its distance from the observer. The more objects there are in a certain region of space, the higher the curvature is, and the higher their acceleration. So the more objects you have in a particular region of your space-time - the higher your acceleration is! The more acceleration you experience, the faster you move through space!

So, the theory of Einstein's relativity predicts that there would be an infinite array of different velocities for 4D entities, and an infinitely diverse array of dimensions for 4-D entities. Of course this theory is only valid for objects that move through a certain range of spacelike dimensions - for example, if an object is travelling in a 4+1 dimensional space (where it is travelling faster and more rapidly than the rest of the objects in the same 4+1-dimensional universe), then it is not possible for it to travel in a higher-dimensional space (such as a 5+1-dimensional or 6+1-dimensional spacetime). Of course the theory only works for objects in a specific range of dimensions - if an entity is traveling in an infinite dimensional space that is infinitely higher or lower, then that entity would not be able to travel at all!

So far, so good! Let's take another look at our 4-D particle - the particle that we created from the 4-D universe. We created this particle by taking a slice of a 4 dimensional spacetime at a specific instant in time. This slice of spac-time would be represented as a line in a 3D graph, and it would then take us to a 3D projection that is the 3D representation of the 4 dimensional particle at that specific instant. Now let's take a closer look at this line in 3D space:

This line is a 3D representation (in 3D space) of the trajectory taken by our 4 dimensional particles as they move through the 4 D universe. The trajectory is a curve, and we can think of it as a "path" taken by a particle as we move through spac-time. This path is a line, and is a straight path that is defined by the speed of the particles at that point in time.

Now, let's consider the slice of the spacetime we took at a particular instant in time:

Now, the slice is represented by the point (x,y,z,t) in the 3D graph. Now, let's take another slice at a different instant in time;

Now the slice at the second instant in the time series is represented as the point in the 3-D graph (x′,y′,z′,t′):

Now let's take the slice from the second slice at another instant in times:

And so on...

Now let's look at the slice that we took in time t:

Notice how the trajectory of the line is curved, and that the curve is a curved path! This curved path is called the trajectory. Now lets look at a more detailed view of this curved path in 3D spacetime:

In other words - the trajectory is defined as a curve that is curved in 3D. This curved trajectory is called a trajectory. The path is defined in 3D as a straight straight line that is a continuous curve. This straight line is called an orbit. Now let us look at an orbit that is moving through the spaceliness of our 4 D space-time:

The orbit is a circle - a circle that is bounded by a curve. The orbit is bounded, and so is the trajectory.

Now let us take a more in-depth look at these orbits:

These orbits are all circles that are bounded by curves - they all represent orbits that are circular in 3D, and they all have the same radius! This radius is the radius of the orbit, and this radius is equal the radius at which the orbit would be at rest in 3D.

So now we have a more complete picture of how 4D particles move in spacetime - we have an orbit, a trajectory, and a curved trajectory that represents the path taken as the 4 particles move. We have a picture of all the 4 dimensions that the particles can enter and leave, and all the velocities that they can experience as they travel through those dimensions.

Now that we have all of this information, we can now begin to understand the
