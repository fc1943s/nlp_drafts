 It's also interesting to see that their energy sources don't follow the laws of physics - the energy of deities does not enter into space-time but is rather transferred from other areas of existence such as atoms rather than from the outside towards them. So deities are a bit weird!

A:

We will be studying what happens if this particle suddenly enters into another dimension.
Imagine this particle as you would if you are looking through a telescope - the light travels through the telescope as you use it. Now at the telescope there is a telescope screen - an item whose surface moves slightly as the telescope is used. You can see, at low magnification, that only part of the particle is visible.
Imagine another telescope - this time with a slightly smaller aperture - in order to view more of the particle. The screen moves even quicker since only a small fraction of the particle is ever seen. So, you see only a small part of the particle. Because the aperture of the telescope narrows the range in which parts of the particle can be seen, it can no longer be described by Newton's laws.

Because of this limitation, we can not see other parts of the particle. Consequently, we do not know how we could describe this particle without a more detailed theory.
But what happens if we can travel back and forth in time - and this is possible? If the particle is not at rest and there are other particles that have moved in the past, then a particle does not move at all.
If several bodies happen to occupy the same place in time, then that place is also occupied by that body: It is no longer at rest.
A particle that moves in time is called a timeless particle: It does not travel, because it is not at rest. The only particle that moves in time is the one that is always at rest - that particle is immortal.
One must note that immortal particles also exist and that their time is eternal. As long as there is no matter involved in the interaction and the interaction potential is constant (no matter if it is attractive or repulsive), this means that all the particles in the universe are at rest, no matter if they belong to our universe or not.
An immortal particle is not a time particle, but it might even be a timeless particle in some situations. In that case the particles in the future and the past will still not overlap.
Timeless matter also exists. For example, black holes are timeless matter. They do not exist in the real physical world and it can be shown that eternal black holes do not exist.
