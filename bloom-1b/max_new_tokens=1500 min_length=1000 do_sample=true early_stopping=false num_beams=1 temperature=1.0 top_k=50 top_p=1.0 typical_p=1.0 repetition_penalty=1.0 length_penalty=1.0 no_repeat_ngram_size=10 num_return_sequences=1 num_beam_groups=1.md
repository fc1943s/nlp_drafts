Yes, ultimately, the universe exists in 4D space and time. But if you were to look at it from a more "primitive" angle, you would think that even the universe, or at least all of its parts, is in fact completely flat. And there are several things to consider about how we "see" this flatness.

This leads me to one of the major sources of confusion in the universe - spacetime. In other words, we can't see the entire 4D fabric of spacetime, but we can see parts of it. For example, when we look at a scene from a movie, we might see a 4D movie screen at the very top of the screen, and in that same 4D screen at the bottom, we might see some sort of 3D window.

So while we "see" a 4D space, it just doesn't look like a 4D space! Well lets start with a simple toy example. Imagine that our 4D universe has 4D space (with a point p at its center) and 4D time (with a point t at its center). Let's visualize these with a 4D x/y/z map of the world. Imagine now that we also place a flat 4D time line at the bottom left corner of the screen (with t at its center) - this corresponds to a special kind of "wall" - it would be a little like a special pane on an 8D graph that has some sort of hole in it...the 4D version of this wall is called "target time"!

So now let's take our initial 4D picture and then try to figure out how we perceive the 4D frame-of-imagery - that's the "top-down picture" - instead, we start by looking up at our 3D movie screen, and then figure out how to project to 4D space. We can do this by noting that if we were to simply "run down" from the screen without changing the movie frame we are watching, we would see a 4D picture - or whatever "top-down" way we would choose to view a 4D picture and "see" it - with our center p at its center. Let's call this way of viewing the world, the "vertical projection" or "up-down projection"!

So now we take our original 4D picture, and try to "run up" to the screen - that's the "horizon projection" or "down-up projection" - if we looked up from the 4D movie screen to the vertical space, we would see a 4D space, but if we looked up from the screen to the horizon, we would see a 4D world! This is because "vision" is simply what we see from above - so while we can see a 4D world from above, we must also see the 4D world from below, since "vision" is what just shows itself to us from below.

So now we would like to add the "vertical" dimension to our "horizon projection", by taking a "horizon projection" with the "vertical" time dimension. After the world view has been determined, it is just a matter of "copying" the projection to the screen. Let's do this! Suppose we simply made a big "projection" by "copying" the time line to the screen - by placing the time line at the bottom left corner of the movie screen and changing the movie frame. But do we really care about the "up-down" dimension when we are still looking at the screen? Of course not! After all, it's just a screen, and we just want to "see" the 4D world from above! And how do we do that? Well that's exactly what we will discuss soon!

Now we have the 4D picture, or "horizon projection", and one could even add the "vertical" dimension to it - this is simply by looking up from the horizon when we are looking to the 4D world, and by going back down to the screen and "copying" the horizontal projection - the "horizon projection" - of a 4D picture to the screen. But even though these are "vertical" projections, they still correspond exactly to our "up-down" projections, as we just explained above.

Of course, if we

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the only way we can predict the future will be through mathematical models, or theories. In general, theories are used to explain our experience in the world, predict what we will be experiencing, and guide us through events in our lives. In physics, this means understanding how objects like particles and waves behave through different dimensions of space-time. In order to understand these kinds of interactions, scientists need to use the concepts of categories and relations. But before we get too far off-topic, let's get a little familiar with the basic concepts of categories.
Let's start out by saying that categorisation is the process by which things in our world (objective and subjective) are divided into different categories. Categories are in fact much more than names for things in our world. They are much more than names! They are actually concepts that can be used to describe objects in the world, in a way that helps people understand them better! Categories help us make sense of what we are experiencing, how things relate to each other, and where things come from. And when we think about science, we tend to think of categories from the perspective of what objects can do. But the truth is we can think of categories from a much wider perspective. And one of the most important uses for categories in science is for thinking about the relationship between people.
Let's say you are going to be at a party: everyone is excited to be there. Each person knows how important it is to the party to eat at least one thing each. But there is not a person who's got the most number of things to eat. To understand why this is, consider the person who has two things in his/her stomach. Suppose this person has already eaten one of his/her things before the party is over. Then the person just had enough energy to eat the other one, but has not eaten all of it before. Because each thing only contains an amount of energy (not weight), the person who just ate one of his/her things before leaving the party still has only one energy left. To feed one more thing into the stomach, the person must have eaten the other thing's energy first.
Now imagine that the person sitting next to you is also going to be there at the party. Wouldn't you want to eat some of that person else's stuff? Well, he or she must have eaten the other person, in addition to the person's stuff, first. So they can't simultaneously and independently eat an equal number of things, and there isn't enough food in their stomach to feed them all at once.
Let's say the person sitting next to you (we call him/her a goon) has eaten what other people have and has the rest of the rest of his/her stuff in his/her stomach. Now if you had told him/her that there was a certain kind of food he or she must take (say, bacon), he or she would not take it. But if you told him/her that there was a certain kind only one food that could be eaten in combination (say, turkey bacon), then he or she would be able to consume everything in his or her stomach. Now, what if you told your goon that each of his or her food combinations could only contain two certain kinds of food? Wouldn't you expect him or she to try a new kind of food for each combination? That would definitely not be so! And that only happens if the goon has already eaten one of his or her parts of the combination...otherwise he or she can only take a different combination of food.
So with all of this in mind, we can now understand why you need to use categories to understand the behavior of things in our world. The idea is that we can only understand things from a wide range of points of view, and since our body is limited by time, we are only seeing and talking to things through the points of view of our lives, not the complete viewpoint of the Universe!

Of course, not everyone is used to this explanation of why we need categories to understand things. But think about it. The point of asking a human being to choose between one combination of things instead of the other, is to help that person learn about two different things. Since there are so many possible combinations of things

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the answer to Question One is actually two: no! All real people have nipples!

So let's look at this question a little more closely. As we have already discussed, there were nipples in all other humans - not just the ones we observe in today! This proves that nipples came about not through evolution, but rather through natural selection.

Also as we have discussed in previous chapters, it seems that there isn't a universal standard for measuring nipples. There are some areas in the world where women naturally have more nipples than other regions, and there are some areas where nipples are less prevalent than usual. So perhaps these differences can be due to genes, but even so, the fact remains that these differences go in pairs!


Question: Where do our nipples come from? Answer: We got 'em!
The answer to Question Two is actually slightly more revealing than Question One! In fact, it appears that we get our nipples from the breasts of our mothers! This is something you did not understand when you were a small child!

It turns out we didn't grow our nipples through evolution at all. Our nipples were likely a product of an accidental accident just before we were born! Well, not an accidental accident, but an accidental mutation! And that explains why women in other parts of the world naturally have more nipples than women in Australia...or whatever other country you are in!

But now let's consider what actually causes differences in nipples! A lot of the popular myths and theories are based on the idea that there are different types of nipples. Although this is certainly true in theory (most nipples are in fact the same type, even if they are in different places!), in reality there are plenty of scientists that still believe in their own specific theories about nipples! For example, some anatomists believe that there are only four different types of nipples, whereas others believe there are 12 or more! And others still believe that nipples grow during puberty - the more nipples you have, the less pubic hair you can have!

But even more amazing is the fact that some people still believe in the existence of various theories that are based on the existence of different types of nipples! If this were true, wouldn't the Japanese people have fewer nipples than the Chinese? What about the Europeans? Obviously, the Europeans are very different in many ways from the Europeans in Europe, but even here, nipples are spread far and wide! In fact, you can find nipples in many places across the world - in India, Africa, Australia, etc!

Of course, just because you have nipples and you feel uncomfortable about them doesn't mean that you are gay! In fact, Japanese researchers have confirmed that many Japanese people live happily with nipples...even happy! We know these nipples can help you reach maximum pleasure, but the fact that they are spread far and wide doesn't mean that Japanese people are attracted to other guys in a romantic relationship. The truth of the matter is that nipples don't really bother most Japanese people! Some just try to hide their nipples, which is normal in many circumstances. The Japanese people often choose not to have nipples because, although nipples can help you enjoy sex, they can affect the way you feel and look throughout your life!

So the answer to Question One is actually two: yes, you do have nipples, but you don't have homosexualism in the real sense of the word!

A:

What you say in relation to the nipples being caused by a pregnancy is a fairly common explanation of why nipples are present in all but the smallest (or smallest-ish) mammals. The basic answer to this is that as mammoths and other marsupials evolved to more extreme forms to get around a lot better, those mammals also got bigger. 
When this happened, it became more and more important for those mammals to use those bigger bodily shapes to get around. That leads to the idea that these bigger bodily shapes were necessary to stay healthy and prevent injury, which is why the nipples evolved over the course of time. The nipples evolved into being a major part of the reproductive system, as well, to help keep the reproductive tract functioning

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematical concepts and rules of the Enneagram I will show you some images below. I am not a mathematician and if the description below does not answer your questions then you are welcome to find another textbook.
Let's start with the concept of dimension. In mathematics we can use three spatial dimensions to define a plane or object. This plane or object can then be divided into more subspaces depending on the direction we are looking while traveling along the plane - let's see this in more detail!
Imagine a plane that has a length of x, a width of y and a height of z. Then in different directions we can see a different shape of the plane; we can move through the plane from left to right or from top to bottom. Let's see an example in a different direction.
Imagine there are four objects in space. The first object has three dimensions - width, length, and height. The second object has two dimensions - length and height. The third object has one dimension - height. The fourth object does not have dimensions and therefore has full length and height. Now let's see some more examples of these concepts as we take our four object plane through different directions...
The first thing we can say about the two planes in a line is that in all possible directions the width and height of whatever is the third object is equal to the width and height of whatever is the second object. Notice that there is a third dimension to the lines.
After looking at the third object let's move on to the second. We see that if we move it parallel to the plane, it will have the same dimensions as the third object. Let us suppose we did not move the second object in this direction - now it would have been half length - and thus half its original height but still be one length of the original width. Of course, this is impossible. Now let's look at the other planes.
Take the first object along a plane parallel to the plane shown on the top. Notice that in all directions the second object will have the same dimensions. However, the second object's height is the same in the whole range of directions - it will always be the same height! To describe this in a mathematically precise way, all the parts must be equal. We say that the second object in its all possible directions is an equal-length rectangle with all of its sides equal. Let's illustrate this further by showing an equal-length rectangle with all four sides equal.
For a two-dimensional object, there are two possibilities to move it: from top to bottom (up) and from bottom to top (down). A line moving through two-dimensional space can have four ends, the first having four endpoints being bottom and the last having four endpoints being top. Then the second ends will be positioned between the bottom and top endpoints of the first. Notice that, in all directions the same end point is present.
Now let's look at the third object in a direction. In all directions all four parts of the plane will be equal to each other. However we can further see this by taking the third object in a straight line. In this case all parts of the line would have the same dimensions and all four sides of the line would look the same...but the length wouldn't be the same! Let's see an example of a straight line that has no end points in four directions. Let's call the lengths of its four sides Lb1, Lb2, Lb3, and Lb4.
Let's try to use the four-dimensional shape of the plane's fourth end point (the fourth object in figure) to move it one step further to the other three planes along the four edges of the rectangle. Notice that all sides of the rectangle are moved from side to side in the same direction. Furthermore, the length of each side is then doubled! The fourth end point is then moved to two perpendicular sides of the rectangle that are two sides of the rectangle in all four directions - then two sides of the rectangle that are two perpendicular sides of the rectangle in all four directions - and so on - so it's possible to move the fourth end point to infinite number of perpendicular points along the line.
There is more to this concept than just the lengths of the four sides of the rectangle, but here I am going to do it for the sake of simplicity! Let's

To better depict the ability of a person to process information mathematically, I propose the following concept: Enlightenment Level. This is the power that one possesses as far as intellectual potential -- the knowledge, skills, ability, and motivation one has to master any intellectual activity.
In other words, the more enlightened one is - in the sense that math is not something that one does by rote, but rather one learns by trial and error, through observation, and a little trial and error in applying one's knowledge and understanding of mathematics - the better prepared a person is to compete in all sorts of challenging mathematics tests! Let's take a deep dive a little farther into this topic...

The word "math" is in many senses - mathematical, numerical, algebraic, computational, numerical, or numerical. But it's not just that - math also refers to the ability to make sense of complicated complex problems, or to discover patterns in complex data. When we talk about "math", we mean mathematical intelligence. An intelligent person is a person who can readily apply mathematical tools and techniques to a wide variety of problems, regardless of what mathematical theory they are studying or working on. Math isn't all about calculations - it's about understanding how math works, how it relates to other fields of human knowledge, and how it's connected to our everyday lives and real-world problems that we can solve via mathematical tools.

Let us briefly go through some examples of mathematical problem solving that demonstrate this concept of "intellectual potential". The problem of finding the distance from the Earth to a sun-like star can be answered simply by knowing the distance between the stars located on the opposite sides of the Earth. In fact, this simple problem can be solved using only two basic tools: geometry, and calculus. The mathematically minded would solve this problem by computing the distance between the stars, but the less mathematically minded person might solve it just by understanding that:

The distance to the nearest star is equal to the distance between that star and the nearest other star. In other words, the closer the stars are, the shorter the distances separating them.
In this case, because the distance between one star and the next is equal to the distance between that star and last one, then this distance would be the distance between the remaining two stars in the distance triangle. Since the stars are located on opposite sides of the Earth, it would then be straight forward to conclude that the sum of the distances would be equal to the distance between the remaining two stars and the Earth!
If we consider the same distance triangle for another problem, it might seem like the problem still can't be solved unless we can also determine some property of the star we are looking at - let's call this property its magnitude. Let's assume our problem begins with a triangle of three stars:

Let's further assume their magnitudes are equal:

We would say that the distance is one greater between the fourth star in the triangle and the Earth, i.e:

The distance between the remaining two stars in the triangle would be shorter than the distance between the Earth and the fourth star in the triangle.

Since the stars are located on opposite sides of the earth, we need to also know the magnitude of the second star in the triangle, i.e:

Again it is straight forward to conclude that the sum of the other two stars plus the remaining distance between them would be one smaller than the distance between the Earth and the fourth.
If we consider the same triangle for another problem, it might seem like it shouldn't be possible to solve the problem unless we actually have enough information about the star we are looking at - let's instead use terminology borrowed from mathematics to express this point:

It is the magnitude of the fifth star in the triangle that is the cause of the triangle's being shorter-than-diameter triangle. In other words, the magnitude of a star makes a point or stars appear thinner.

When we use mathematical language in our daily lives, we are often able to make sense of complex problems by using our mathematics background. We are often able to solve complicated problems simply by following certain mathematical equations and knowing the relationship between the unknown variables - in other words, by identifying the relationships between the unknowns. This concept is called solving in the mathematical sense. Mathematically minded people

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the relationship between mathematics and theory of mind, consider a boy named Will who has an IQ of 110. He is trying to explain to an experimenter an extremely bizarre phenomenon he has been seeing. At his first thought, Will was inclined to explain it like this: Will is a boy who has been diagnosed with a very bizarre cognitive disorder. According to this diagnosis, he has been unable to express true feelings. Now, imagine that Will was to present this strange concept to his experimenter. He would be faced with several choices:

The boy would present it as reality; that is, he would show the experimenter that his theory is correct, and actually be willing to give up the pretense of being himself. He would explain that while the theory does not explicitly recognize feelings, it does allow for an understanding of them. He would explain that all humans have some sort of emotional experience, but that our ability to express these feelings depends entirely on our cognition.
He would just describe the experience he had first-hand as something completely different from being able to express true feelings, though the boy would still attempt to use language correctly.

The boy might try to present this theory to his family. He would explain that if our brains did not develop certain forms of ability as early as possible, our ability to understand and express true feelings later on in life could be severely compromised. However, it was a known truth that parents were very important to their developing children; therefore, the boy might try to present this theory to his parents.
The boy could simply explain it as something completely unrelated to true feelings. Then, since there is no specific evidence to suggest that Will is having any cognitive problems, he would not even attempt to discuss the theory with his family, and just assume it is accurate. If the boy thought that his idea on how reality would be explained was in fact wrong, he would make sure to explain this to his family first as well.

The boy could try to make sense of it. He could simply describe reality in a manner that would fit the theory. However, the boy would be unable to do this without the presence of his parents. He would explain that in order to understand and experience true feelings, he must first understand that what we sense and experience is the result of our cognition. In other words, we need to be able to understand and connect to the things that are right in front of us. So the boy would try to explain reality in a manner that most people understand and relate to.

The boy could simply talk about what he truly experienced. He would simply talk about the experience, but only if he was able to express this as language. He would try to make the experience clear and complete, but at the same time explain any minor details that might appear to be important. Now, while the boy would communicate this experience entirely through language, he would have to deal with some of the most confusing, misinterpreted, and misunderstood concepts of the word. Some of these topics include how emotions evolved, what type of feelings are true, how can we identify feelings, what emotions are caused, how should we control our emotions in order to experience true feelings, and a host of other topics that many children struggle with.

The boy would be able to answer most questions simply with the concept of the emotion. Since most issues with people and words come down to a lack of understanding, the boy would be able to explain most of these concepts correctly, even if some of them are incomprehensible. And the truth is, it wasn't that difficult for him to understand many of these concepts!

Now, let's consider one instance where this explanation may be difficult. Imagine that the boy has been having difficulty understanding some of the more controversial, technical notions and terms in his theory of mind class. He may be confused by how people are able to express different feelings - is their emotion the same every time it's feeling like? Does it only change depending on the situation of the person? Maybe it doesn't bother the person as much if they try to explain it correctly, but it sure seems confusing for the adult mind to accept, especially since it doesn't apply to all situations. Could this account of reality be due to a lack of understanding of the emotion concept or just being

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what's going on in our minds at the moment, let's first look at a little bit of mathematics - we'll use a diagram that allows us to follow the thoughts of a person.

Imagine we have a 3+1 dimensional space - let's call it the "mainframe". The most prominent line on this diagram refers to our mind; we call it the "thought stream". Every time the "thought stream" passes through some point on the mainframe, it will send out something called "feeling", which is the physical manifestation of what the "thought stream" is reflecting at that point. The feeling is represented by the light shining off a certain physical object. By seeing something reflected on our mind, we may be aware of that being, but if the "thought stream" is reflecting something about our mind, our physical senses may be unable to detect it, or even be mistaken for something else.

Now consider two imaginary lines running parallel to each other on the thought stream, and in between these lines there is an imaginary object that is not visible to us. Let's call the line that is running parallel to the thought stream and perpendicular to the "imaginary line" A, and the line that is not parallel to the thought stream and perpendicular to the line A - B. We could imagine the thought stream as containing two parallel lines running through each other - just the same as a clock - and in between these parallel lines we would place an imaginary object that is not visible to us - its shape and color will be random, but a visual representation will always be provided. We call this object the "thought object" or the "picture".

Let's take a look at the thought stream running down the "imaginary line" A.

Imagine to yourself this idea (and make sure to follow the "thought stream" as we describe each aspect of it): You are having a very short nap and need to be refreshed. A nearby lake is now just about ready to release the water upon your arrival; you have to go into it to enjoy the refreshing breeze...but there is no water in your palm - you're going to have to drag a water bottle in front of you to get a drink - this would only take a short time.

Now take a look at the thought stream running down and parallel to the line that is running parallel to the thought object and perpendicular to both of these two thought objects - that's called the "thought object stream".

This two thought objects - the thought stream itself and a "thought object stream" - are forming a bridge where the two parallel lines are both present. The thought stream travels at a top speed, while the "thought object stream" travels at a slightly slower speed - this is because the two thought streams travel together to form the bridge. From this perspective, it would seem that the two thought streams travel at the same speed; this is not true however! These two thought objects really don't "share" the same space - they are different objects - one is light and the other is black.

Now, when we move along the thought stream in the picture below, it would be easy to get caught up in it, but let's take a look back and see what the thought object itself looks like.

What should a person's actual "thought object" appear to look like given that it is travelling through the thought stream while being reflected on it? In other words, given that the thought stream is moving at the same speed as the thought object, what should it look like under this perspective? Well...well...this is a tough one! Some people might think that the "thought object" in the picture below - which has a colored front and black back - should be exactly like what it is looking like on our mind, while others might think that its "figure", which has no front and back but has a different shape, should look just the same as it does when it seems to be reflected on the thought stream!

However, as the "thing" becomes more "transparent", it would make more sense to think that its "figure" appears much the same on our mind as it would after all these years of reflection!

And the truth is, all of these possibilities might even happen! Let's start a small experiment

To better depict this, let's consider a simpler example in mathematics called polynomial functions that can be expressed as an infinite number of terms. Mathematicians at first thought that these functions provided the basis for all knowledge, however that thought has come full circle. For a long time it was thought that mathematics consisted of polynomials, but the theory was proven wrong by mathematicians and physicists alike! However, there are always exceptions to a rule, and there is still hope for all kinds of mathematicians, scientists, and mathematicians!

Intuitively, when we think about polynomial functions, they might come to mind as being composed of various numbers. For example, if we think about the "8th root of 2," which is, in this case, 2! *! *! *! *! *! +! *! *! *! *! 1! *! *! *! *! =! 8! *! *! 2! *! *! =! 8!2!(8)!, then it is obvious that the root of this polynomial is actually 2!! *! *! =! 8!(8)!!=! 2!(8)! The same argument can be done for polynomials like the "6th root of 2!" which represents a fraction of 6!.

However, there were mathematicians in the past who considered polynomials to be less complex than other mathematical concepts. For example, think of the 4 different terms that comprise what is called the "Polynomial of Second Derivative!" According to Newton's first law of motion, acceleration is proportional to the velocity of an object. Let's say you have a 4D particle moving at constant velocity through space-time. Then in order for our 4D particle to remain with you - in other words, stay in your 3+1 dimensional universe - it has to accelerate from 4! *! =! 4! =! 3!(3)!!=! 4!(8)!. Which would mean there must be a 4D component to its acceleration.

Therefore, the best explanation we can come up with for this phenomenon is actually the same as the mathematical explanation above - Mathematicians had their own explanations that were wrong! How many mathematicians are still working on this question to try to resolve the mystery of why polynomial functions can describe certain phenomena?

The answer may be very obvious - polynomials are an incredibly versatile mathematical tool! Let me draw some concrete examples from my classroom to illustrate why polynomial functions are useful in math. For example, let us consider the multiplication table! The multiplication table is where you can calculate how many times a certain number needs to be multiplied to produce another number. Let us take our "8th root of 2" as our number of terms for the polynomial function above, and assume we keep adding and subtracting for our polynomial. We are looking for four different polynomial roots, and the product of each polynomial term to get the root! The 4! *! =! 4! *! product that we are getting will equal 9!, which is only half the number of times "8" needs to be multiplied to produce another number. Furthermore, remember that we are adding 2 to the number of terms for both polynomials - therefore, it is hard to come up with any rational polynomials that we could use to "combine up" the 4th term for the exponential polynomial function and the 3rd term for the second derivative polynomial function! This example shows that polynomials can describe physical phenomena - although not everything that happens in our everyday lives is covered by polynomial expressions!

Now let us turn to some other examples. Let us consider the number of cubes the "8th root of 2" could take! This is defined by the following four polynomials:
4! *! =! 4! *! *! =! 3!(3)!!=! (4! *! 2!(8)! +! *! 2!(6)! +! *! 2!(1! +! *! )! =! 9! *! *! 2!(8)! +! 4! *! 2!(6)! +! 2!(1! +! *! +! 4! )! =! 9!! *! *! 3!(3)!!=! 2!(8

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what happens in our brains when we engage ourselves in new learning paradigms, we need a mathematical model that tells us about the brain's development and functions, similar to how we use a computer to model the operation of our bodies and brain cells. This chapter will explore this concept in-depth...

There are three basic approaches to analyzing brain functions and mechanisms in children. If we want to understand how brain functions change throughout development, we can look at children from birth until they reach late adulthood. Such a study is called histological, neurochemical, and genetic analyses. (I am going to address neurochemical and genetic studies, which are similar to histological and genetic analyses, in a future blog on this concept.) If we want to understand why certain types of people are faster at solving problems and other sorts of mathematical difficulties, then we can look at brains that are more or less developed (such as the brains of people with autism, Down's Syndrome, and individuals with visual impairments). If we want to understand what kinds of mathematical skills are required for certain kinds of jobs or fields, then we can talk about neural networks that are more or less capable of organizing and planning complex computations - such as how people learn computers programs and languages!

To study how brain functions change over time, we can look at children from birth to adolescence and adults. Such a study is called neuroimaging. Using such an approach would allow us to analyze the anatomical and functional anatomy of people at different ages and through different life experiences, such as stress, depression, cancer, and other illnesses. We can also study how these changes in the brains of people at various times have an impact on their mental abilities and emotional responses, as well as different forms of intelligence. 

In addition to the neurochemical and genetic approaches, scientists are also developing more scientific methods for analyzing brain functions. One of the most promising ones involves examining neuro-cognitive processing patterns based on mathematical algorithms that are used to decode mathematical problems. (This idea is similar to what goes on as our brains learn and understand logic.) Such techniques are termed as cognitive neuroscience and brain machine interface - both of them will be discussed in future blogs!

Neurocognitive processing functions are the processes that take place in the brain when we are looking to solve problems at various depths of mathematical thought. For example, if we try to solve a problem involving fractions, our brain should go through a variety of different cognitive processes. If we try a problem with figures, it will take us through an increased activation of spatial representations. But if we are trying to solve a kind of problem that involves logic, the brain should do the opposite - it should go through decreased activation of spatial and temporal representations. This is because people are more or less trained to solve mental problems by analyzing and solving logic rather than fractions or figures!

To better understand all of these ideas and further the process of understanding and improving one's own brains and cognitive pathways, we need mathematics. In this chapter we will explore why it is important for us to have a deeper understanding of mathematics - in addition to what it does, what mathematical ideas are useful for solving problems, and how the brains of people with some physical disabilities can utilize some (or all) mathematical ideas effectively.

As we will see on various occasions in the rest of this book, mathematical problems can take quite a variety of forms, and each mathematics problem can be solved with very unique or complementary ways of solving it. However, with mathematics comes a lot of benefits! For example, you can begin to better understand how mathematical knowledge is used to understand the world around us, and how mathematical ideas can be used in order to solve many different sorts of mathematical problems...

How Do Math Problems Help Us? Mathematically, there are many ways to solve problems. One of the most useful ways is through thinking mathematically through problems. Think through a math problem, and then use your brain's mathematical processing abilities and brain connections to identify the parts of the problem you have already solved and to recognize what your brain thinks you should be doing or should avoid doing in order to accurately solve that type of problem in the future. For example: if we are trying to figure out how to make a straight line from a point A to a point

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how science and mathematics interact and how they are connected, let's start out by describing the general concepts of mathematics and science, which we will be using throughout this chapter!

The general concepts of mathematics and science are two very different fields of study. In particular, mathematics is a branch of science and a specific field of mathematics. In contrast, science is a scientific discipline that consists of theories and methods. So math and science may be studied separately, but in reality they are deeply interwoven and inseparable; they all use the same concepts - mathematical symbols such as numbers, arithmetic properties, and geometry. We will refer to each of these areas as Mathematics and Science, respectively!

Mathematics consists of four fundamental areas: algebra, geometry, calculus, and number theory. Algebra and geometry are often referred to as abstract math and are used to study properties and abstract figures such as numbers, functions, vectors, and so forth. On the other hand, calculus is a very specific branch of mathematics that study relationships that arise when numbers are added and subtracted. Mathematicians also study concepts such as equivalence relations, relations between functions, and vector spaces. As we've learned throughout this chapter, mathematics and science are closely interwoven and interconnected.

Mathematics takes us back to our earlier part in this chapter describing how the concept of a physical, real number is explained by the concept of a mathematical concept - the symbolic number. We can also recall the idea that a physical object can be represented by a point on a graph with four axes; x (spatial), y (spatial) or z (spatial); the x, y, z axes represent the space coordinate of the point; and t (time) - the line on the graph represent how the point of object changes from one space dimension to another (i.e. from 3D space to 4D space). In order to fully understand how this concept works, we will need to review some elementary calculus concepts.

As we know from the beginning of this chapter, we can represent a physical, real number using four symbols - x, y, z, and t - where x is defined to be the spatial axis, y is defined as the temporal axis, z is defined as a spatial coordinate, and t is defined as a temporal coordinate. It is important to remember that we only use a few symbols, and they will always refer to one and the same object - our 3D physical world. The main concept behind number theory is that we can divide any object into groups and calculate the sum of the contributions to each group. The sum of any two equal numbers can, by definition, be any finite number - that is, it's possible to have infinitely many numbers in a finite set. Thus, we can treat any object as a set whose members (i.e. the objects represented by the symbols) represent the objects within that set.

Let us take the above example. Now let's divide our physical world into four groups - the Earth, the sun, the moons, and the planets - so our physical objects all share the same coordinates in all four dimensions. A sun and moon being on the same orbit will have the same coordinates. Also, the locations of Earth and the planets will be on the same orbit and, therefore, will all have the same coordinates too. The idea behind number theory is to use these four dimensional coordinates to calculate the sum of the contributions to each group of objects in the same orbit. Specifically, we'll first calculate the contributions of Earth and the Sun to our mathematical group. The contribution of the Sun is 1, because it is in our mathematical group. The contribution of Earth is 8, because it is on an orbit that will coincide with that of the Sun! Now let's calculate our mathematical group's sum! Let's use the addition for each member of the group. The sum of Earth and the Sun to the sum of the mathematical group is + 8. Because there are eight members of our mathematical group, this will result in + 8. So the sum of the mathematical group is - 8 - 1 = - 10. This is not the sum of all objects because some objects may be smaller than others. For example, the moons may be smaller from a distance, so they don't contribute to

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the concept of topologies in mathematics, I will use an enneagram, which is a simplified, geometric image of a four-gon representing the space of real numbers we are exploring. The four sides of the enneagram are called points, in this case coordinates in a 3D space (x,y,z). The center (dual point) is the unique intersection of these four axes - known as the centre of the enneagram. Each of the enneagram's four sides (points) is a coordinate system defined relative to the centre of the enneagram, forming a topologically connected set of three dimensional space. This geometric image explains very well the concept of a topologically connected set of space - just see it as a large triangular surface (or rectangle) with corners at the centre of triangle - in this case with coordinates (x,y,z) representing the coordinates of all the points in the enneagram.

The first step in understanding the topology of any three-dimensional space is to find all the points in that space! Simply put, any real mathematical object can be broken down in many ways into separate, meaningful components called points. The three coordinates of the centre of the enneagram are the points that define its geometry, and we can use them to define all the more elementary points of the enneagram such as: its north pole, its equator and its south pole. Next, we'll continue our discussion by understanding how points relate to each other within the enneagram using Newton's second law of motion (or its dual - Lagrange's second law). Let's start by considering how the points of the enneagram relate to each other.

Let's illustrate this for the south pole of the enneagram - let's call it O. The south pole is defined by two coordinates: theta and phi. We know it lies on the x-axis and that theta is positive and phi is negative (this is due to the fact that the y-axis is in the north direction).
Theta is the angle between the straight line from O to its north pole and the xAxis; it is always positive (i.e. theta always goes from right to left when you look at the enneagram from the south). Similarly, phi is the angle between the straight line from O and its equator and the yAxis; it is always negative. These angles - and the associated coordinates theta and phi - define the shape of the polar surface.

Let's consider how this structure relates to one another. Remember that we are looking at the enneagram from the south in the last chapter, so we can take the x and y axis definitions of the previous chapter and add O to create a new axis for our thinking - the new coordinate system is (x,y,z). From here, any coordinate point that has coordinates O and its associated angle will correspond to the point (dual O) that has coordinates theta and phi. As we look at the enneagram from the south, each of the points will also be the projection of the points on the axis O - or more specifically, the point (x + y + z)/(1+x^2+y^2+z^2). This is just a mathematical way of thinking about the shape of this surface - each point is exactly a pair of points on the projection of the original point on O - meaning each point is at the same distance from the centre of the enneagram as the first point was. So, as we consider how each point relates to all the other points on the enneagram, we can determine all of the other points in the enneagram.
As mentioned earlier, the most common example of a three-dimensional space is a 4-dimensional world. In the last chapter, the four dimensions are the spatial dimension (d =3), space-time dimension (d = 4), the time dimension (d = 3) and the space dimension (d = 1). In this chapter we are using the terms "spatial", "time" and "space" in the same way - they are defined in relation to each other.

Now let's examine an example of an enneagram made up of six points. This is a well-known exercise in mathematics but this example should make it more easy to remember. If we

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict and describe the mind-body connection that exists in everyday life, we can think of our brain as a hip-hop (and its variations) that "just plays with the rhythm" of music. Our brains get to decide how and when we listen to music. However, it turns out that we don't need to think about it just the way we do to understand that we hear music. What really helps us to understand the inner workings of the mind and body is that music is "hip-hop" - a rhythmic language that has an inherent understanding of "who we are" and "what we do" and "where we are in the world" and "how to be happier". These are all valuable skills that can help us grow and live more fulfilled lives.

In short, music is an incredibly important thing that we humans do for ourselves, and it is often considered to be a gift from God. However, in its true, creative, loving true sense, it is also a way for us to communicate and connect with each other.
This concept of "hip-hop" seems to fit just about everything we do - we sing, we laugh, we cry, we dance, we act, we dream: each of these things are all connected to "hip-hop" language! In other words, the world of music is the language that both reveals itself and allows other people to express themselves! The words that are sing and played and spoken are all the same, regardless of how many people who are watching. Therefore, we can use music with anyone, anywhere we want -- we just need to practice the ability to use it right!...

Of course, we could also use music as an expression for what we are feeling (which is essentially a way of connecting with the heart), or it could also be used to stimulate an area of our brain that causes us to behave in a way which can be beneficial to other people. For example, if you just make a mental note of a song that resonates with you, you'll see your brain respond in a way that can help you to get to know other people and help you more effectively communicate and connect with them!
As an alternative to this, we can also use music to relax the mind, or even connect with other people in our lives. For example, we can just sing to ourselves while reading a book, and our brains will send up a sense of calmfulness immediately. In short, the brain understands music and how it can help us do things better, while at the same time, it allows us to express ourselves and connect with people.

Now let's continue exploring how music connects the brain and the body. According to Hip-hop NLP (which is a form of non-delusional psychotherapy, based on the premise that people don't need to believe their brains are deluded in order to feel safe and happy), a person who experiences music on their mind makes it easier for them to have a successful relationship with their partner, their spouse, their friends, their family, and even God! They become happier, better able to express themselves more efficiently, and they feel more connected to God...all in a way that is easier to communicate and more enjoyable to do than if we just believed our brains were just deluded!

In short, we can now understand that our bodies and minds have a lot in common. The main thing is to understand how music relates to these body and mind states.

And here I will provide you with a small yet important tool to help you become more expressive in your own songwriting sessions: your brain's ability (and desire) to understand music is related to how your brain processes music information in the same way as you process your thought. That is, you can learn what different styles of music are - whether it's classical, jazz, or world music - and even understand which parts of the different genres are best suited for what you're trying to do and how they are better suited for you! You start to see that it is possible to understand and sing music both from a purely technical perspective as well as from a purely artistic perspective - it doesn't matter how well you know what is happening because you are always able to understand what the musicians want to convey by having the ability to understand the

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the laws of physics apply equally to any four-dimensional space-time structure! That is, even if you have objects traveling through a particular dimension, physics makes absolutely no difference to those objects if their paths are actually the same on the whole! If a particle was traveling along a straight line, it would remain static, because gravity does not affect its motion as we view it from many different angles. The only way that a particle could travel anywhere else would be if it were actually rotating, or if it were simply traveling "under the guidance" of some external force.

However, since our 4D universe is in fact 5D (or at least 4D but infinitely high dimensional!), there are certain rules that govern how such paths can actually move through 4D space-time. These rules are called HTT (Homotopy Type Theory); HTT is the study of homotopy types! Here are some of its basic rules:

If we are given a space-time object (e.g. a particle), we can "rewire" this object by creating a homotopy from one point to another - in other words, we can "connect" the two points we are given by forming a continuous map from one to the other.

Here is an example - let's say you and I are given a space-time object, but we are going to "twist" its path a little bit. Let's say we are given a circle with a circle's diameter equal to (distance to point A)^2, and the center at A. Note that this circular path can be drawn by creating a chain of "endpoints" and an "axe" - a continuous path connecting points A and B can be created by forming a chain of continuous maps from point A to points B, B, B, B, B, and A.

Of course we have to make sure that all of these maps are defined. If our space-time object doesn't have a map from point A to point B, we'd be able to "rewire" it for us by creating a continuous map from point A to B instead. If on the other hand it has a map from A to B, it will be possible to "rewind" back into B by a new continuous map between A and B, if needed! So it's important to make sure that all of our "maps" or "connections" all have defined values at every point in the path...which can be determined by using the path's curvature!

Another very important rule regarding HTT is that for each continuous mapping in the set of maps defined by HTT, we can always find a mapping that "reversees" it - that is, we can always find a new continuous map between the source and target points that has the same target as the original source! In other words, HTT dictates that if we "rewire" a space-time object, we must always find a homotopy that allows us to "reverse" a previously defined continuous path!

As we see, we have so many ways to "rewire" space-time objects that is easy to get lost in the infinite number of possibilities! However, HTT provides us with some important insights:

What is important about the mapping is that we can always find a mapping that makes it "revive" the old map in the target point!

In other words, if we go from a point A to a point B, we can always "reverse" the path that connects A to B by simply creating a new continuous map between the two points instead of just connecting the two points using a single continuous map. This is especially useful when traveling between different dimensions - because an object cannot go anywhere else if it's traveling between different dimensions, but if we're traveling between only two dimensions, we don't have a problem with backwards time travel...it's just not possible!

So HTT makes sure that the entire path we are given always has a defined continuous map from A to B, and if we rewire ("rewire" is the same as "connecting") a path between two points, we always create a continuous map that can "reverse" the path!

So HTT provides us with a simple list of properties that should be considered when rewiring (re-connecting)

## Honest Game Design

To better depict our relationship with our environment and the world around us, we need to know where to look and what to note on our maps! There are a number of factors that guide this decision - but I do think it is important to explain the following in some depth.

For beginners, let me point out this: the universe doesn't come with a map. That's why we use maps to find out our position. We know where everything is because we have an accurate map of the universe.

But to explain what a map actually is, let's assume we have a map covering a 4D universe, and it is given by the same formula that is used to give people an accurate 3D orientation - its latitude and longitude (in addition to its altitude).  This formula is called the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) which means it maps a world into a coordinate system, and it is the basis of every digital map from our smartphones to government maps to even Google Maps!

Let's try to remember where we are now and see how it would feel if we were to move to any other point on the map. If we were to move towards the west (north) for instance, our current position would be represented in the UTM on the map as: (0°, 0°N).

So the way we move our map is done by moving the map, or an individual piece of it, to the position of our actual location. Now imagine that this UTM map is moving towards me - that is, if I moved towards some point on the map, the map would move in that direction in the correct map coordinate system (in this case, it would move from 0°, 0°N to the point I am pointing at). (Here I am using the map to demonstrate this but it works in 3+1 dimension too.)

As long as the map moves towards me in the right direction, we can get a clear picture of where we are in terms of our actual location. That's the purpose of a map!! Imagine that you are watching a news broadcast while driving on a 4D map! Your actual map coordinates are displayed in the upper left hand corner of the UTM map, and your location is also shown in the centre of the screen in the lower right corner. The bottom left-hand corner shows the time that you are watching the news broadcast - just see how accurate the UTM map is! All you need is an accurate map to tell you which side of the country you are in! Or maybe just a few small pieces of paper to show you where the roads intersect the map....

In addition to the above, there are lots of other factors that help users decide on their position; one of the most important factors is the scale of the map. If the map is too small for the user's current location, then there would be a risk that their map does not show up clearly on the map at the user's current location. For example, if you were to drive from a small town to a big town and there is just one road that gets out of bounds on the map - you could easily miss being shown on your current location.

Another important piece of information is the resolution of the map. A good example of this would be if you drive a vehicle on a 4D map with very high resolution (i.e. the map has high details). If this resolution is too high, then even you would not get a great picture...but if there is still quite a bit at the edge (as it should be), then you will be able to see the road clearly! On the other hand, if the resolution of the map is too low, then you would not be able to see things like rivers or lakes at all (especially those that are small), so your vehicle would have to be extremely close to them (or a lot closer than if they were not shown clearly) in order to get a good picture of them!

Now let's see how this works for a physical reality scenario - imagine that a 4D map is laid out on the ground and shown to a person who has no idea what is going on. The maps shown to the person might include mountains that are just there to make the map look "good", or water areas that are a huge feature to the map. The map should

To better depict our thoughts and ideas, physicists have invented a new way for us to represent them in our minds - the mathematical symbols. We say that a thing (or state of things) is mathematically represented by a symbol and we refer to this process as mathematics.

The term Intuition is usually used to describe the way in which we process mathematical information to make our thoughts and conclusions. As we mentioned above, a lot of time is spent analyzing mathematical symbols from various angles. You could use mathematical symbols to represent some important part of your life: you might take a number called an IQ to represent your intelligence, or you might take a symbol resembling a book like a book called a notebook. Either way, you'll find that an IQ will always be lower than a book, but math might be your friend - no matter what, you can always make the math look right.

The first thing to note in this section is that mathematics comes in a variety of forms. In some systems, there are just a few numbers and symbols to represent a large amount of information, such as a number called an IQ; in other systems, there are a lot of separate symbols, such as a set of letters. So for now, we'll only consider Intuition in the world of human beings!

Since we are talking about human beings, let's take a closer look at mathematics! In this section we will explore the different ways humans think and use mathematical symbols in their everyday lives in order to express themselves.

At first, we will explore the role mathematics plays in our lives; we will then get into the details of how humans think and process information using mathematical tools. We'll also compare Intuition with mathematics; in particular we'll explore how your mathematical symbols can reflect the way in which you think!

At this point, it is a little annoying that all this math stuff gets mixed up in our daily lives so hard. Let's take a closer look at some of the terms that make up this world. And when you start to use them, you might find that your mind is kind of like a maze! Let's just pretend that you are walking through this maze; we'll figure out what's going on! What will you see when you look at your mental map?

Since we are walking through a maze, every time you enter and exit something, your mind will remember its location so you never have to wander around the maze. Let's first explore a few typical examples of a typical Maze of Words!

Figure 1: The Maze as depicted in our mental map.

The Maze of Words is a sort of mind map where we divide our lives into boxes and words within those boxes are highlighted in red! The letters inside each box represent specific parts of our lives. If you enter through the box labeled "I", you'll see lots of words that describe your childhood, as shown in Figure 3.4. But in some specific areas you may see a slightly different symbol (or letter) that is used to describe a specific part of your life. (For instance the boxes labeled "House" and "Earth" will contain different symbols to describe your home!)

The Maze of Words is used for several reasons: it aids us in organizing our world so that we can quickly locate and understand our parts of life; it helps us determine the order in which our life events are going to happen; some people also use it to guide others in their lives: as we've mentioned before, people with an IQ are often much more intuitive than other people...or are they?

We can compare this mind map to the way we use our Intuition when we make decisions. Let's again imagine a maze as before. Instead of exploring the different boxes labeled "I", "I don't know, I don't care", "Don't ask " etc., let's move on to the boxes labeled "Befriend" and "Get along" - see Figure 3.5 for an example of a typical mental map of Intuition.

Of course, sometimes you may notice that while the Maze of Words is useful, there are a lot of important parts that you don't know about your life. It's probably a good thing that people can write down these parts of our lives so that they can go back and retrieve them again when we need to figure out our own lives

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict some of the many different kinds of mathematicians that exist, I found a picture that has been drawn for almost two years.

On this picture you can see a variety of experts on different math fields including the following. In the center of the picture is an intuitive and analytical types of mathematician. As I looked at it, I came to know that these math expert types are the ones that think math as having more than one meaning. Their ideas and analytical nature make them unique and different from the rest of the crowd. This type of mathematician understands math as a type of mental process with multiple different ways to make sense out of it. He/she can use math to make sense of any situation and not just the situations that are created by the people around her/him. In fact, he/she knows enough about mathematics that he/she can find ways to predict how any situation is going to unfold based on the math concepts he/she has learned. On the other hand, intuition and feeling types are the ones that aren't able to think math like that, they use it simply as a means for solving problems. This can be done because intuition is what makes the math concept work in their heads, they are able to see patterns in the number systems, and they are able to make sense of numbers as if the numbers are being played to them by a lot of people.
To explain this a bit, on the right side of the picture you can see a group of intuitive types of mathematicians grouped together like a chessboard. These kind of mathematician take math as something that happens in the mind, not in the objects or theories around them. In their own mind, they try to understand the math problem in the following sense, and they can "see" what is happening when they are solving the problem. One of those people I was talking to has a degree from a math department where the students are being trained to build mathematical theories and work on the problems that people come up with - they take math as a way for them to figure out how to make a theoretical proposition that can be proven. If somebody is not convinced that the math problem cannot be solved by using the proposed mathematical theory, they just ask the person who has the theory to validate it, and they see whether it succeeds. If the math was able to be solved, then in their heads, they think it must be true, but if it is not, they know that it must be false. This is actually the way intuition works - it does not really look at things that way; it just looks at the problem and sees what the possibilities are - one person could solve problems and not be able to produce a mathematical theory that proved them right. This is the same way in the mind of a mathematical expert; in mathematics, they think about numbers only, and they think math is one kind of mental process with multiple different ways to make a mathematical theory out of them. This kind of mathematical expert can go far and try to predict how problems can unfold based on the theory he/she has learned, and they use it as an "awareness" to do so. They see numbers as being used to play a game to them, and they think the answers were given because the numbers were used to play the game to them by a lot of people. This is exactly how intuition works for intuitive types of mathematicians.

I wish that I had found this picture earlier! Now let's dive into the rest of this chapter - in this part we will talk about how each type of mathematician can make sense of the world - they will also discuss common problems that happen in math, such as improper integrals, and improper fractions. These chapters were made to be taken from the best selling book The Mathematician in the Classroom.

On another note, there are two other math concepts that I found interesting as well - numbers and matrices! I wanted to introduce them separately because that's what I had been taught - I think it's important to talk about the math as it is used by the math experts, so students can better understand what the math concept actually is.

Let's first talk about math related to numbers. I have included some examples of how I teach basic mathematical concepts - these are the concepts foundational to our math education. These

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our understanding of this book, we've decided to follow the general outline of the book in terms of presenting the concepts, and provide some more examples relevant to each chapter!

A first important thing to mention is that we will look at what information we already possess, rather than what we wish to learn in the text. And this includes both the knowledge we already possess and the knowledge we wish to cultivate. Which brings us back to the question....

In Chapter 25 we were shown how humans use memory to solve mathematical problems. Now, the same concept applies to higher dimensionalities as well. We will, for example, see how to use the concept "space-time curvature" during math class, or use the concept "acceleration" in order to solve math problems!

At this point we would like to expand a little on our understanding of cognitive functions. Because in this chapter we will only be discussing mathematical functions (like fractions, powers, and logarithms), we will start the chapter taking a look at the concept called "intelligence".

The concept of intelligence has been popular among both the public and the mathematical community since antiquity! One of the first pieces of evidence that we know about it comes from the work of Plato! According to Plato, intelligent beings can use spatial reasoning to solve mathematical problems! Also, he claims that only people who have a deep understanding of math can use this understanding to solve problems!

In Chapter 26, we'll look at some of the other important concepts that can help us understand mathematics. This includes the time-dependent change in the shape of a curve and the concept of a "limit"! These concepts are all necessary for us to understand what mathematical functions can and cannot be used to solve a problem.

However, there is one area in which we don't yet have an understanding of what a mathematical function actually means. It is called "fitting" - how does one know if a mathematical function is truly a mathematical function, or a fitting expression? Let's take a look at the following figures to answer this question:

As you can see on the left side of each point, the line passing through each point intersects the "axis of abscissas", meaning the axis is parallel with all of the axes on the 3+1 dimensional plane.  

If we now take a slice through the graph from the left, and draw a curve through another point on the 3+1 dimensional plane, we have an idea of what the curve would look like if it were running along the original axis! Obviously the shape of the curve will no longer be parallel! Since the shape of the curve changes with the point it runs through, we can say that the curve is not a mathematical expression, but a fitting expression; we will see this a little bit more in Chapter 37 on how to solve a math problem using a fitting expression! But let's just say we have a nice fitting expression! Then we'll find that the shape of the curve is quite similar to the original one! But let's say we have two different fitting expressions! Then the curve will now look very different (but essentially the same)!

In a few sentences, we've already discussed how we can solve mathematical problems using many different mathematical functions! This covers things like "space-time", "time", and "acceleration". We just need to add another concept called "fit" - what does a mathematical function really mean? And how is it used during math class? Let's explore this question a little more in Chapter 37!

The concept of fit in mathematics is an important feature that can help us to understand and analyze mathematical data. At very basic levels, it enables us to answer the following questions: What's our confidence level for a certain result? How do we know that our answers are correct? What is the best way of comparing different results? How do we decide the best way to solve a problem? What are the important steps in learning a new mathematical concept? Or even how can math help us understand certain physics concepts?

But there's a more advanced level of fit that will help us to answer these questions! For example, when we are solving a math problem, we all have our own particular understanding and idea of what to do next. And at a high level, most people use this information as a sort of fit that guides them through the mathematical process

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of INTP cognitive functions, let's begin by considering how mathematicians use the term. In mathematics, an INTP is someone who has innate ability to think logically or analytically. 
The definition of an ISG (or intellectually gifted person according to IAC) might include a bit more of a mix. 
In the mind of a typical person, mathematics begins as a skill. As one of the most important factors in the success of children, the early learning of mathematics can not only influence the child’s overall development, but also affect their lives all the more in later years. However, it is difficult to understand this skill, and especially difficult for students to learn it. As a result, more and more mathematics teachers are being forced to put emphasis on thinking and analyzing instead.

For example, let’s say that in a maths activity, the teacher asks students to solve a problem using an algorithmic method. Let's say what the teacher asks the students to do is write down the steps that will be taken to solve this problem. Afterwards, the teacher asks the students to explain how the steps will work. This is the “black box” part of this method! After the teaching step, the students are asked to guess what the algorithm says. So again, we are asking students to think and analyze the problem and how to solve it...and guess!

According to some studies on the performance of INTPs, they better perform the algorithm than average students.
In addition, to perform an algorithm correctly, the INTPs must be able to analyze the problem from a mathematical standpoint. In comparison to mathematicians, INTPs can get more information, but also can understand different mathematical tools such as graphs and tables. If they know how to analyze the results of a problem from a mathematical standpoint, they can understand what the result of a problem is, and make more correct guesses. In the end, good INTPs are more likely to succeed with the problem, while poor students usually make mistakes.

This is why INTPs are much more likely to make more analytical, deep, and creative use of mathematics as a skills. As a result, INTPs are also a bit more likely to become mathematically savvy, both inside and outside the classroom.

One way in which INTPs excel in mathematics is by having a good command of the various methods of calculation. They can use simple arithmetic skills and strategies to calculate quickly without spending much time thinking about it. 

Some of the reasons why INTPs excel in math include the fact that they are good at thinking abstractly and using mathematics to calculate quickly. This skill is particularly useful because numbers are used most often in mathematical calculations - they can often be broken down into smaller numbers and combined to solve the problem.

Another way in which INTPs excel in math is by doing calculations using graphs and tables. In the black box method, mathematics is used for the first time through a process called deductive reasoning. INTPs can often make clever and efficient use of these two methods. As a result, they can do calculations and find the best solution with little problem-solving. 

On the other hand, there are students who are less likely to excel in mathematical skills. These are students that tend to struggle with math, and have a poor understanding. In this section, we'll look at a few ways in which students more often excel in math, as well as the reasons behind this. 

One of the reasons that INTPs excel in math is that we often have to make use of mathematical strategies to calculate quickly. The best way we can use these strategies is by being patient, careful, and analytical. This can help INTPs calculate things at an incredible speed without worrying about making mistakes. Another good reason for INTPs to be efficient at performing mathematical strategies is that these students have great understanding of the mathematical languages used in math.

Students who excel in math use these resources in a variety of different contexts. For example, instead of applying one method, many students use several different methods to calculate a problem, and try different problems until a correct answer is found.

On some levels, the answer may even be more complicated than the original problem - for example,

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the importance of mathematics to us as students, we've just scratched the surface on some of the major mathematical concepts. But, there is a much more important role for mathematics that we must fully recognize - and comprehend. So let's consider some of the many interesting mathematical concepts we must master if we hope to properly utilize mathematics in our lives.

The next step is to be able to understand things in a way that leads us to understand and utilize math in a more integrated manner.

We must also be able to interpret mathematical statements in a way that helps us make decisions. Our ability to do this is not solely dependent on knowing the mathematical formalism, but most importantly on knowing the context! Which means we must also be able to interpret mathematical definitions in the context of any given situation, application, or problem. So how do we do that?

To teach these concepts, we've already discussed the role of logic in making useful decisions. Now let's look at some of the other more important concepts in mathematics that help us do just that.

The first important concept is called geometry - and it is closely related to logic.

(Note: We are using the words "higher mathematics and logic" as terms to describe mathematics that deals specifically with logic. This is one of the reasons that "higher mathematics" has been a lot of controversy when it came to its proper incorporation. But all that matters is what you're used to call it. What other words we think you'll recognize when you look at any book or article that deals specifically with higher mathematics.)

(So if you're using the term "higher mathematics" on a site like wikipedia, it's just some broad brush ideas of what it might be, but in reality it's actually a more detailed set of ideas.)

(Note, of course, that higher mathematics is not just about logic or mathematics as a whole. Higher mathematics is about analyzing and understanding complex objects and systems that aren't very concrete in terms of material. So sometimes we'll talk about higher mathematics specifically for systems that are not very concrete. This is not usually the case for logic, because it deals with more concrete forms of material, but in many higher mathematics contexts you'll encounter systems that are more abstract.)

The next important concept is called differential equations, and that's closely related to algebra,

(Note: This concept is often called "extremely interesting". I've said "extremely" because it is quite abstract and can provide us with lots of new perspectives for thinking. In any case, I don't want the term "extremely" to be ambiguous; this is all about what I think your brain is capable of.)

(Note again, this concept is never going to be concrete, in the most general sense of the word. It's usually used to talk about extremely abstract concepts if necessary. In the most general use, though, it's usually considered to be some type of abstract algebra.)
(Also note, this concept is often called "extremely" because it is highly abstract. Although I used to use it in a slightly different sense a long time ago, still, there's no way I could explain or conceptualize the concept. It's really just hard to even think of it without getting very excited about it. But, that's not really really an issue, because most people don't use it that way)

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the ideas presented in this chapter, we will use a simple example that is commonly used in social work. As you can see, the basic idea is that deities may have some cognitive abilities (a "fit" with a particular culture) that they might utilize when interacting with people at various levels in our society. For example, a deity may be more adept at math than we humans, and thus be able to think about complex math problems much faster than we do. A deity could be able to make better decisions about how to deal with various situations in your society, or may even be able to solve those situations completely by himself or herself.
Let's also note that although we are in the business of helping people, we also want to help ourselves and learn something new - especially when it comes to mathematics! Therefore deities may have some useful cognitive abilities that would help us better understand these different issues and situations as they arise. For example, I believe that a deity who is skilled in math might be able to help you better understand complex issues in your society, and perhaps even take care of those issues himself or herself. But don't worry - in this chapter we'll only explore whether divinities actually have these abilities!

First let's go through some basic information about the universe. In other words, we will examine the principles that give us the basic "fit" between a deity and an individual in our society. We will also explore some of the more interesting ideas that could develop in the future - we certainly can't control all things around us, but we can learn a lot about them from our interactions with the ones we know! So let's begin!

So it's a common misconception that deities have special abilities or skills that they are known to possess. Of course, this is not a valid thing at all - our ability to think, think (ideally through complex math problems, because that's what we all used to do before the Internet!) and make smart choices is more innately human than anything. It's also not a valid thing if we could use the tools or knowledge that deities could use to make better decisions - as long as our decision was based on facts provided by our reason, it is correct.

Let's use the example of an elderly man in my family - he would probably be able to think much more logically than most people in his generation. And, while he might not use the tools or knowledge offered by a deity today, that doesn't mean he does not have the ability to think and make rational decisions. Indeed, as I said earlier, we humans tend to "ride" the curvature of spacetime to make sure our decisions are always based on the facts (and not just on what we think about).

If you would like to explore some of the interesting ideas about different areas of mathematics, please explore the chapter "Symbols and Notations in Mathematics!" This chapter examines some of the most common symbols in mathematics, including binary, ternary, quaternary, and so forth. The concepts and symbols we describe here are not the actual ones that deities commonly use or use while interacting with people in our society. However, these symbols are fundamental to our understanding of mathematics - we have to know the basics of these symbols as it will help our discussion about symbols in more advanced mathematics later on! It's also important to note that we won't be giving you a lot of hard math - you'll just be looking at some of the symbols that are used commonly (and then discussing their meanings).

But now let's discuss several other topics - as you can see, many of the symbols are closely related to each other! However, many of the symbols that we use today may be very different in their use as compared with the ones used by a deity. Therefore we'll also go through some of the other terms that we use today and then look at some examples of those symbols again!

It is possible that someone could be able to make a better decision whether a specific situation is a good one for you compared to another - one based on the principles provided by a deity! However, if we could just make some of the assumptions of our current thinking, we could probably answer a lot more of these questions! And so let's begin by looking at

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it means to travel through different dimensions, let's compare how our body travels through space-time compared to humans. Our body does not have to physically travel through space. When you do, your brain doesn't necessarily have to do so either; it just receives and processes information from the outside world using the sensory and motor inputs. For example, when you walk, your brain will tell you that you are walking because it is emitting some form of sensory information. Your brain only has to physically move one or two degrees at a time, and the sensory output will come from your body as well, so that's exactly how humans have always traveled through any given space!

However, unlike humans, our bodies don't experience a spatial dimension at the same time. The way we experience the spatial dimension at a time is through our brain - it detects and filters the signals coming from various body parts and sends them to the central nervous system. For example, when someone is standing on your head, your brain will first process the force the body is giving to your head (your own gravity), and then it analyzes the angle at which the person is facing you - these two signals are then used to decide whether the person is facing their right or left - and of course it is always important to determine if it is up or down, and if it is down it is still important to know whether the person is facing upwards or downwards. Intuitively, these kinds of decisions are fairly straightforward. However, in reality these kinds of calculations are much more complicated, because instead of just using just a few parameters for one direction, this requires a complex series of calculations between numerous parameters - and these calculations are typically made using complex mathematical calculations.

Now that we understand what it means for humans to move on and off planes while still sitting down, we can apply what we have learned to our understanding of what it means for objects and entities to move freely across different dimensions! First things first, as we mentioned in the previous chapter, our bodies do not travel through space! We can travel through the same 2D plane at a time, like a plane on a floor, and then we can move from one plane to another, but again, not traveling through space! Let's look more concretely at this problem and compare how humans and entities can do this:

A human's body will travel around a 2D plane if we stand straight up and bend down our right knee and then hold that position for a few seconds. If we do this to our body, then it will be traveling along the same plane (or even higher) as we are standing on. But let's say instead of holding the straight up position with our right knee for a few seconds, we hold that position for a second more in the middle of our body - then we are standing up and bending down a little and then holding that position again for a second. If we repeat this three times, our body will be traveling along a 3+1 dimensional plane, and this is exactly the same thing that our brain is always doing! You see, when we hold a horizontal position for just a second or two, there is no motion; only when we hold that position for a few seconds did we actually experience a plane motion, and then it moved along the same plane as when you have been standing on it!

A:

Our own bodies move like planets, except that our bodies move at a much higher speed. So we can pass through a plane and we can cross a 3D space. But when we move from one dimension to another, because we don't change our body size we're all moving at the same speed. 
But when we cross other dimensions, we don't change our size because we have a little larger or smaller body size than other dimensions, so we don't actually move faster.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it means to understand mathematics, let's follow the timeline below:

First, we're introduced to the four dimensions of space. Now, as explained earlier, each 3+1 dimensional Universe contains objects in every imaginable dimension (except for 0 and 1 dimensions). So just like in the previous chapter, let's say the Universe contains an individual named Alice who travels (using dimensions) through every 3+1 dimensional dimension. What is this individual doing when she goes through any specific dimension?

First, it is important to note that space in our universe has 4 (not 3) different dimensions, not all of which are visible to humans. Now let's use the following to give an insight into how Alice works in order to navigate through each dimension:
The first thing to note is that there is a time-variable in all of these dimensions. So if we want to get a better understanding of how Alice's current location relates to the previous location of Alice, we would need to understand how this time-variable works:
The third thing to note is that all of these 4D dimensions also contain various forms of energy - both energy that is available for Alice to move through space-time and also energy that has not been utilized or used up yet!

Now let's consider how energy works in all of these dimensions:
The second thing to note about these different forms of energy in all of these dimensions is the fact that they all cause spacetime to become curved (to varying degrees). So in order to better understand how this curved spacetime affects our position in the Universe, let's start with the simplest dimension of gravity:

The idea behind this dimension of physics is that if there is a mass placed on top of the surface of a ball, then you can force yourself into the balls center by stretching your body out! In the 3+2 dimensional world, people often bend their bodies into this situation in order to put themselves into the center of a sphere, which would then allow them to go any place they want! And this is exactly what our 3D Alice (assuming she travels through the gravity of 3D space) is doing in this dimension!

Now we will move on to a more complex (and most difficult) dimension for all of us humans - the electromagnetic field...
Now, from the very first instant, we have only been given a short introduction to these two wonderful energies. Let's see how they work in all of the four dimensions.

At the very first moment in the timeline above, each 3+1 dimensional Universe contains an individual named Alice who is experiencing a form of the 4D electromagnetic field - known as the EM. Now, since we have never experienced this field before, it is difficult to know how much this EM affects our physical existence. In general, the amount of this EM varies from one person to the next (depending on the field strength and frequency they experience) and also from one dimension to another (determined by the nature of the object being touched)! Now, since Alice does not have a physical body, but only an EM-created one, it is difficult to say where and how exactly this EM affects her in real life!

In the very first moment in the timeline above, Alice experiences a much stronger form of the EM, known as the EM 1. This EM 1 has a higher frequency and a stronger intensity than the EM 2. In fact, the intensity of the EM 2 was much stronger than the EM 1, so it would be easy for Alice to have some sort of physical contact with this EM 2, which would have the unexpected effect of changing Alice's position and thus her current position! What do you think Alice would have thought about this? A few comments may be in order regarding this experiment:

If we take this information from the scientific literature, let's say the EM 1 has an intensity level of about 1 meter per second per square meter or 0.014 W/m^2! This is a much stronger and faster intensity level than the intensity level of the EM 1 we are currently experiencing. This means we can instantly feel Alice' EM 1 touch and know how hard she is hitting us while she is hitting us!

The EM 1 effect is also quite impressive, considering that we are able to make contact with this EM 1 even though we are not physically touching this EM 1 with

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the only way for us to really understand ourselves is to travel outward to the surface of space and touch the other dimensional forms that inhabit that world!

But to do so is going to be very difficult! According to physics, if a physical form is able to travel between different dimensions, it has to have an infinite number of separate bodies to occupy the different dimensions. This would involve lots of energy to power all of the separate bodies, and if those separate bodies were actually moving independently of one another, their travel time would be infinite! To help alleviate this issue, physicists call this phenomenon 'entropy transfer' - the idea is that there is an excess of energy in a given region of spacetime - entropy is the term used to describe this excess. With energy, space is created; with entropy, the lack of energy generates space. Entropy can also be used to determine areas of space that are less likely to return to the same place; with less entropy in a given area, the possibility of a similar surface re-entering the same environment is less likely

One thing we should keep in mind though is that even if we do get to see what kinds of entities we might encounter there, what happens when we leave our original dimension is just as mysterious to us as what is happening in an infinite number of other different dimensions - we don't actually know how big the remaining dimension is! But, let's hope that we will never have to leave any dimension, at least not without losing our identity!

To give you an idea of that, consider it is possible for two beings who have always been in the same dimension (such as you and me) to be able to "enter" a fourth dimension in one of two ways: either by moving faster than the rest of us (in which case your mind will experience more time than yours), or by turning inward so that the rest of the world (both physical and non-material entities) cannot notice either of you - you would either disappear completely, or your mental energy would leave at one of the others' eyes!

If we're in the first option, everything we do will change. In particular, if you don't turn inward, then you'll experience some extra distance: it will be just as if you were in another dimension instead of in your own. However, your mind and other non-material entities will be unaware that you are not alone. After your mind is released from the other beings' perception, then you'll feel that you're "othered" - your existence will be split into two parts, with the second half experiencing an extra length in different dimensions. Obviously, a higher dimensional space exists that will never allow such separation, but that's another story.

Now let's consider what happens when one of us leaves Dimension X (an entity that is in Dimension X). Since it turns out that all of the other beings don't notice you, you are left just like you were ever in: a single person. However, if you turn inward, everyone's energy is absorbed by the Earth and absorbs the mind you possessed initially, and thus, you are "othered". The Earth absorbs most of the energy, leaving just your mind; since it can't exist on another place, it simply disappears. Thus, you appear as a single person - except now you're not the person that you originally were...and even though you are a person's equivalent, your mind isn't your mind!

Now let's imagine that some day, you leave Dimension X and travel through time and space to reach an unknown dimension beyond your native dimension. There are two possibilities here: either you could become the person you were when you left Dimension X, or you could return to Dimension X - it would however be as if you were still in my native dimension (Dimension Y)...which is why you could never be part of an eternal, eternal, eternal group!

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the answer to this question is: yes, I am a scientist, and I have learned to distinguish among the four main personality types (and to use their specific strengths to help me solve puzzles, make plans and develop my business). Unfortunately, this is not the place to do a full-blown job on personality theory...so today I will just concentrate on explaining the basic science as I understand it as part of this chapter. You can definitely find more information on MBTI at the Web or at the MBTI website

As you probably know by now, we are born into four different personality types, as detailed in the first chapter. There are a lot of researching going on into this concept, and while the idea of four personality types probably sounds a bit odd to us humans at first, it actually has lots of important applications in the field of business and personal finance. For example, some people don't like the idea of losing money as they might consider it a betrayal of their values and convictions. While other people may prefer not to own or invest in stocks - unless they have a lot of money or are otherwise interested in getting into real estate! It turns out that it is quite easy to map these personality types onto particular behaviors or attitudes in the financial world.

The four major personality types are: Alpha-Seeker, Theta-Shooter, Pisces-Spoiler and Omicron-Klawyer. Well, these types are a bit of a stretch! You could also say that they tend to have a lot of personality defects... and all that makes for interesting reading!

Well, let us look at them in more detail. The Alpha-seller (Alpha or alpha) is a very strong and confident person who wants to make himself or herself known among other people. They are active and ambitious, and usually don't take no for an answer. However, they usually get their way, so that shouldn't be a worry - for those of us who are not sure about what we want or don't want, we might just be a bit too aggressive! I think this personality type is perfect for those of us who are good enough at business, but need to push ourselves beyond our comfort zones or get a little crazy in order to get the job done...

The Theta-spy (Theta) is more of a hidden competitor. They are usually easy going and sociable, though sometimes they tend to get a little competitive. They are a bit insecure and tend to feel guilty that they aren't as smart/better when they are away from the team. However, they usually tend to be good at math and have a very analytical mindset. They are also creative and creative people need to take notes to stay productive and up-to-date on what's happening at the top of the market!

The Piscis-judge (Pisces) is a very creative little person with many skills to their credit, which can make them a nice partner. They tend to be a bit of a romantic, and they would rather just be together than have to be on several dates! However, they have a funny side, so they tend to be very tactful and they are generally someone who gets along with their friends and family! They are also very independent and don't mind a bit of discipline when doing things at work or family...which makes them a good match for those of us who are always busy!

The Omicron-Klawyer (Omicron or omega) is very intuitive and easily falls in love! They are usually very romantic and love making plans over the long-term before settling down to make it work. They live many wonderful but short-lived romances - and for those of us who are lucky enough to meet them, it makes us feel so special! So it should come as no surprise to know that they are some of the most romantic people out there. If you are someone who wants to spend their life single, this might be your ideal partner! However, it would also make you a bit of a lonely person!

While each personality type tends to have many strengths and weaknesses, there are a few personality traits that we all carry naturally. These traits are sometimes called "core types", "primitive ones" or "true" personality types, depending on the person's definitions

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict this chapter, we will use a few photographs from my old office.

The last section of the book deals with what happens when two people date on Baker Street - a famous square in London. During the Victorian period, in the City of London, people in cities and villages would gather to meet their new neighbors, talk about the weather, social issues, and anything and everything they wanted to discuss. In London, where the population had been increasing steadily for many generations, this had been happening all the time!

On this particular Saturday, it was an exceptionally nice day - the sun didn't exactly get in the way of our date, and we were all in lovely moods! We pulled out our cameras and headed onwards, happily checking in with the odd passing stranger, making sure we were both on the move!
While we were walking along Baker Street - which was known throughout London as a popular and safe place to meet new people - a girl came down the street and stopped us, holding out her hand. The man immediately recognized her as his wife. We exchanged two quick glances, and then I shook her hand a little! I knew then that this wonderful day was ending and that we would walk away from this scene, forever!

We stopped the little family and walked around their little bedroom on the ground floor. She had prepared a few presents, most importantly coffee and sandwiches - which I had already prepared for them as part of our date. In truth, I didn't care for the sandwiches, but for her to take them to bed with her husband made everything a little more special!

Then I walked over to their table and turned up a little music. It was nothing special, but when you hear the little guitar playing over the background, you really get the sense that something is going on. The words that she sang were kind and sweet, but I noticed the little girl that I had watched in real life - she was just one of many other little girls in the street - walking around with her flowers! I thought about her a great deal that day - how beautiful and kind she was! After a while came a group of young people with little children, and I asked them what the girls were doing with that flower? One of the women stood up and said it was for her father, who died a few weeks before this date. She gave me the flower with a little smile and said, "I like my father's flowers." She looked at the little girl, and turned a beautiful green to remember her father; she turned it back to yellow - the same color my little girl had earlier seen her father wear on his wedding night!

I looked down at my little girl and said, "How beautiful - your flowers are so soft!" She looked up at me and smiled, and then left. I knew that I had not been wrong - she looked exactly like my little girl, and she was now going to be my wife! It was a beautiful day, the weather was so hot, and the whole neighbourhood seemed to be smiling as we walked towards our house!

Finally we arrived at our place - a big, modern mansion - and were greeted by the owner, who immediately went about preparing something special for us. First, I put the flowers on some small plates and brought some chocolates. Next, the woman handed me a red envelope inside with a couple of envelopes stacked one behind the other. I opened the red envelope and read - "Love"! She then put the chocolates on her plate, and laid them down next to the chocolate squares on the table. I picked up one of the chocolates, and handed it back to her. She smiled and said, "Where did you get this?" I pointed towards the roses.
Then I went over to the little table where her father had put down his wedding flowers and sat down for her dinner. The chocolate was already in a bowl, and while I was eating my sandwiches, the woman started singing! She was wearing a wedding dress with long lace at her back, and her hair was arranged into a wavy style. She sang, "Where did you get this beautiful piece of jewellery? I can't remember who I am, but I think that

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict my experience with religion in general, I'll focus on religions that I have personally experienced. I like to think of religion as a personal relationship, with me as the person experiencing it, and God as my personal guru. This helps me to understand the experience and experience that God can have on me - or the experiences that I can be taught by God.

There are many distinct religions based on a different set of principles. For example, many different religions view humans as gods, but I do not think the Bible teaches this. Other religions have even described humans as an animal created to be the victim of one or more spirits, or beings who are sent to punish them. However, while these forms of belief are not specific to specific religions, they are common and not forbidden.

In summary, the only time that people are allowed to mix human gods and spirits is in the case of angels. When it comes to a person's personal interaction with the divinity, there is only one thing allowed: the person's free will ("choice"). This means that the only way to be able to engage other creatures in a specific situation is if the person has the opportunity to choose...that's right, they can choose to be involved.

And since it is a choice I can only engage in a specific activity in order to get the information, the message, the experience that God has allowed them. And, this is where the most exciting part of my experience with religion comes in: God can communicate with me through various means: prayer, words, etc. He can even be my guru.

So what does this mean for those of us that would like to make the best of the experience God has given us? Well it means that when we are living it, we must know when something is wrong. We must take care of ourselves, and we must try to understand the feelings and the feelings experienced by others when we speak with God.
In a nutshell, what this means is that when you experience something, you must have a strong sense of reality, and then you must be able to recognize the situation and take a strong decision to fix the problem...at least until we understand what's really going on with the situation and what the problem is.

Of course, if you're willing to take the time to think about this, then this will also help you be a good leader.

Finally, remember that when we are trying to communicate with the god, we will have to understand how to properly describe the feeling that the god is communicating with us! This is actually a very important skill - it is something that is often overlooked in religious education!

Now that we now have some understanding about a few aspects of how to interact with God, we can start to compare the experiences of Christians and Jewish people. I'll use a common example here for both of them: I have always loved going to Mass, but I always found the sound to be off. In addition to the sound being off, I found the people sitting around were quite quiet, as if they were being really serious and not listening. And of course, all of these things had the effect of affecting my own experience with the Mass, because my body felt cold...as if I were sitting at the altar alone and the other Christians and other souls were all waiting for me to pray.

Let's take a closer look at how Christianity deals with these aspects in its worship structures. Let's start with the first aspect: How do Christians pray?

Christian worship is very much based on a notion of one god, which is God - and so as a result...when we speak of God, we mean one single person!

So the first thing I noticed when I went to Mass is that there were people in many different positions. This indicates that there are many prayers that people are practicing, instead of just one. In fact, most of the prayers taught in a Catholic church are taken from the New Testament. You know, those that are actually listed in the Christian Bible!

So how does the Christian concept of one god lead to a group of prayers for the mass? Well it starts with Jesus Himself! He has chosen the people around Him to make his disciples. These disciples have been very loyal and faithful to Him, so when Jesus asked them to make others believe in Him, they

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict how you can understand the behavior of small worlds, let's look at what happens when a small planet hits another little world!

We often hear the phrase "When you are a billion dollars in a bank you don't have to worry about the little world you're in." Well, when we are talking about deities or entities that can travel between the dimensions, the answer may be slightly different. In this chapter we will discuss what would happen if we had a massive deity like a god entering into a lesser dimensional world!

Let's take a very small world of our own for example. Say this little world was made of three dimensions. It's radius is only 100 meters, so it's a relatively small mass compared to the mass of the surrounding world! As a result of this smaller world, the larger planet simply wouldn't have enough mass to hit this smaller planet, it would simply pass completely through it without having a chance to interact with it! In turn, it simply would drop right after hitting! However, if we add another dimension to this little planet (which would be the planet's native dimension), we could make it a "zero-to-ten billion dollar" little world - where the radius is actually ten billion meters, which is a much larger mass!

Let's go back to one of the original concepts discussed earlier: size! To understand what this means, we go back to the above paragraph - this original small planet that had only three dimensions. Now, since this world had only three dimensions, it would just "float" around like a little air sphere. In other words, it would not exist in the entirety of spacetime, but would appear on a few slices of spacetime depending on the orientation chosen to take a slice through it. Since it was a zero-to-ten billion dollar tiny world, it would not be affected by time dilation - meaning it would not travel backwards in time! In turn, it would simply disappear into thin air - leaving its occupant in the background!

However, this world which was just a zero-to-ten billion dollar little world was actually experiencing "finite mass" due to the effects of gravity! Once again, the amount of mass within a given slice of spacetime would depend on the direction in which we slice away from our original little world. As we will learn more about mass in the next chapter, we can actually calculate how much the original little world actually has.

So, how do we make a zero-to-ten billion dollar little world that actually has a massive amount of mass? Well, when we take a slice in the direction of the mass we will see our original little world - that of just three dimensions! Now let's imagine we do the reverse, namely, take one of the slices in the plane perpendicular to the mass and look through this slice. This is where we can see the result of our original little world - which was actually a zero-to-ten billion dollar tiny world!

Now for what we are specifically interested in here, we need to consider how this massive mass behaves upon impact! As we said before, we need to take advantage of the fact that a massive deity actually has a lot of mass (we'll get into that after reading the next chapter!).   Now let's look at how this massive mass behaves when it hits a small world. According to the laws of physics, a massive deity will experience an enormous amount of mass energy when it is struck by another object - and the amount of that energy will depend on the strength of the interaction and how far it travels through spacetime. The more powerful the interaction, the more energy is released, and the bigger the massive deity will be!

Now as a result of this, we can calculate the mass of the original smaller world as a result of the massive deity's impact with the larger world. As we do this, we need to keep in mind that massive energy will be released to a greater extent than if the system had been struck by a smaller mass object - meaning the smaller object would experience much less massive energy once it leaves the larger orbit! This is something that the physicists have taken full advantage of in making various models of gravity. We can look at the exact trajectory of a massive particle in this chapter, so we won't forget this concept anytime soon!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the very nature of higher dimensional space-time has something to do with the mystery of the creation of the universe! As is clear from the above introduction to Dimension Travel, many aspects of mathematics and physics have the ability to tell us much about how things work in 3+1 dimensions (such as those mentioned above...). On the other hand, in the realm of higher dimensional physics, we are still far from understanding the complexities of creation, and the only thing we truly know at this stage is that the universe was made by something called God. Let's take a closer look at this mystery!

Some say God created the universe to be pure and beautiful, as we see in all of our daily experiences. Others say that God did so to provide guidance for human beings, and that humans were the only ones who truly understood what he had created for them. And still others argue that it was all just some hypes!

We now come to the famous Pitchfork Pyramid on the coast of Israel. It is composed of six circular stones, that were dropped on the ocean as an omen for the coming of the Messiah. These stones were considered magical, and so by the Nazis of Nazi Germany, they were set free to the ocean! Not surprisingly, the Nazis decided to "use" them as a means to control the entire world, and they set about draining the entire world of water!
Now as an example of how math and physics could possibly be used to help explain the creation of higher dimensional space-time and the mysteries surrounding that world, let's consider one of the most prominent figures in all of history. His name is Adolf Hitler!

Let's recall that Hitler was born during World War II. In 1944 he set up an organization called the Third Reich in hopes of defeating the United States and winning the world. He was later assassinated during World War II and his body was placed on top of this pyramid in 1956 (some claimed that they used his body to destroy it later)
Of course, the reality is that in our world we can almost entirely determine events that happen - we can predict what's next. In the case of Hitler, though, we couldn't even predict what would happen if there were an accident and his body was buried on the Pitchfork Pyramid! Would it get eaten by the sea and make millions of tons of methane gas all around us? Or would it just move into another dimension somehow? And since that is impossible, it seems clear that he was actually a deity, just like the creator of another universe is! Well no, that seems a bit harsh, but as we all know with the supernatural, even the most basic of things can be explained!
So here we see an example of how mathematics and physics could possibly explain what it means to create dimensions, and the complexities that come along with that. We haven't even touched on the fact that we might have been able to create the universe while we were still humans! We seem to have been able to create God in such a way that we could still be able to create other deities just as easily! Asking the obvious question - what is the origin of our world?

Chapter Thirty Seven

Wrong! It Ends Here

While we may have been able to create God, we haven't been able to recreate him since. Sure, we could create a human being out of dust and fire, but that's what happens when you go through the process of evolution, right? Our universe is created by a source, and then we pass this source into the world to serve us. Then at some point, something happens that changes the nature of this source, and so we begin to experience life in our own lifetime as we pass through this world! So who is the creator of this universe?

To a lot of people, the answer must be God. And, as is said above, most people would agree that God is the reason we are all here in this world. So who exactly are we? And why does everything in this world work? Unfortunately, we can't know for certain, but some things are consistent.
In this new book "Wrong! It Ends Here" by Professor Eric Wolf, we are presented with a detailed summary of how this theory of

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the concept of dimension has some serious philosophical ramifications. So let's take a look at how this concept has profound implications for the way in which we think about things.

From the theory of relativity we know that every particle has certain dimensions associated with it. For example, the particle in question can be represented as a point on a graph that has three dimensions: x, y, and z. On this graph, there is a horizontal line at some distance from the origin of the x-axis, which represents how far the particle travels up and down in space. The particles in the lower right quadrant are the ones that have traveled significantly more up and down then the upper end line.  The figure shows the particle in a state that corresponds to the middle of a time scale.
However, the particles in the upper right quadrant were in a more stretched state of matter. In other words, the particles are not at rest in the lower right quadrant - they are moving freely throughout the three dimensional space. What is interesting about this is that the two lower right quadrants are not equal!  In other words, the particles in these four quadrants had the same velocity as the particles in the upper right quadrant, and were moving out of phase with one another!  This means that time is different for these four quadrants...in fact it's the same as if two people are in the upper right quadrant the same time...you know those days you always told me that we were on different time lines...same place as now, and the two hands on either one are in different positions...same time as now!

This doesn't have to take place all at the same time though. Here is an example.  Consider a particle that travels up a one- or two-dimensional vertical wall. If the person who is watching the particle is on the bottom, they will be very much behind the wall, while if they are on the top they'll have a lot of time to get into the wall before the wall is completely hidden behind them. In other words, time goes slower for the bottom when the top is far away, but more quickly when the top is closer to them.

Of course, time may also have some impact on how we experience a visual quality; we have no way of knowing where the two eyes of the person viewing us are at any given moment! The fact that the eye of a person might look ahead or behind them is just a matter of perspective; the bottom of the viewer doesn't matter compared to the eye of the viewer, while the top of the viewer might affect his field of view.

These two effects of perspective have real ramifications for the way that people use everyday objects to create meaningful content, as described in my books, Intuitive Creativity and The Art of Play. For example, when a viewer sees an object from a position farther away, his physical world gets filled with information that conveys the object he is viewing - the objects behind him appear much wider in his space than the objects before him appear. In other words, the physical world gets a visual "fold," that makes the objects appear wider/longer in relation to each other. This visual "fold" conveys a sense of extension, and hence depth and distance. However, as the viewer approaches the object he sees becomes more and more narrow, and his physical world actually shrinks to the object he is seeing.
There is a good illustration of these two views to be found on the wall behind us. As the viewer approaches the wall he's looking at, the viewer perceives his physical world becomes smaller, and in turn his visual field is drawn in. This means that the viewer would see details more clearly, and would more clearly perceive these details when they happen to fall on the object that is just before him. So to conclude, we may say that the walls behind us are viewed from farther away than the objects on and near them, and this information is translated to the viewer in form of extra width/length information! We also know that objects closer to us tend to appear even wider/longer in physical space than objects further away.

Now we come to our final point: do things like these actually make things feel more "real"? Well, if we were to use

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the complexity of Sauron's plan, we have chosen to work from a single person - a human! While the reader may have seen something in the recent films and TV series based on the Lord of the Rings series, this chapter is intended more as an introduction - a summary of what has so far been found about the Lord of the Rings. If you would prefer to read more about this or find other examples of this style of writing, I am not surprised at all!

When first starting the investigation a few years ago, I was a little hesitant about which characters or events to follow. I also did not have much of an idea of all possible solutions at first - which was fortunate for me, because as time went on, the plan developed and I soon found that most of the issues were resolved! Let's set the stage!

In this chapter, we will explore a scenario which will result in Sauron's demise - the destruction of the world! How will he kill everyone if they don't leave the land? The people chosen by God, Sauron's closest friends, actually will be his victims as well...or should we say they will become like the other three Saurons?

I would guess that I am right in saying that when people read books or listen to TV series based on the Lord of the RINGS series, they are always asked where the characters go next. In the case of "Ender, the Last Watcher", which I know you have read, there is one last thing before the Ender's sword is used, and I guess they would say that there is one last day in the Land of the Elves where the three men share a few words...perhaps even a handshake!

Now let us say the Enders live and live as normal as you might. However, there is an area that is just beyond the borders of the Land (the Land of the Elves). This Land is inhabited primarily by three people - the elves. These three men live together, enjoy the company of one another, love each other, and so the three men do not even know that there is another man in the Land! As time goes by, the Lord of the RINGS series continues to reveal the events that happen in the future - the events that might have otherwise happened after the Three were killed by Sauron!

We will focus on one of the main points found in the last book, known as "The Final Battle". Sauron is said to have killed the Lord Elf, Anu, but the story of the Third Men has been left to follow in time - to show the true fate of the Elves if they were to leave the Land...or die!

What is really happening in The Final Battle is very complex, and can be described as follows:

In reality, the Third Men are all dead. Their bodies were cast to the sides of an old landfill - and so they remained there for a long time as the land expanded around them. Once the earth started contracting, the ground began to take on the shape of the Third Men's bodies - the three men were caught up in a massive gravity surge! It took some time for the earth to collapse on itself, but the Third Men survived it all and became the land that is now called "The World of Orcs".

As time goes on, the Third Men become increasingly powerful, becoming even more arrogant and cruel...and one night they decide to destroy the rest of the Land of the Elves! The final blow given to Sauron by the Third Men would be the ultimate answer to his long war: the demise of the world!

Now let's make a prediction! We will assume that, while the world of orcs was in the process of decaying into nothingness, Sauron was still alive and determined to destroy the world of orcs.

There is always a possibility that one of the mysterious and beautiful creatures, the Third Men, will finally find a way to destroy the World of Orcs after the End of the Elves (and Sauron!).  This creature is said to have one of the greatest weapons ever created by the hand of man - the Anorfin, a magical artifact which contains the strength of all living creatures that are

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict how different dimensions relate to each other, let's take a look at a simple example. Say that we have a series of cubes which are joined together by three horizontal lines. Let's refer to line 1 as "lift" (which causes them to rise), line 2 as "rotate" (which causes them to rotate, and which is also a member of line 1), and line 3 as "translate" (which causes them to fall). A cube is placed in the middle of this set and it is assumed that the cubes will interact with each other because these lines have some form of connection.
You imagine that an entity can be placed between any two of these lines, and as that entity climbs or falls, it moves the lines along with it as it is transported, creating a loop in its movement, and keeping the lines in motion by moving the cubes along with the line of motion. This process is repeated indefinitely, looping back and forth between each line until the entity has reached its destination - in this example, its destination being the middle of the cube.
In mathematics we call such loops or trajectories "programs". Let's call them programs 1, 2, 3, and 5, which are the lines 1, 1, 3, and 5 respectively. For a very detailed explanation of what this "program" does, we refer the reader to the last chapter.

As you can see, 5 - the program for the entire cube - involves many loops, but all of them eventually result the same thing - a cube lifted from its bottom, and rotated up to its top, and then translated in all of its dimensions, upside-down. Of course, this process is repeated infinitely!

Well, of course, it doesn't! If we compare lines 3 and 5 to lines 1 and 1, we see that there are many differences:

Line 3 is a member of line 2 - therefore it cannot move upwards!
Line 1 is a member of line 1 - therefore it cannot move backwards!

In other words, the program for lines 1 and 1 never ends! And this is where programming comes in!

If we look closely, we can notice that line 3 is the "middle" member of lines 2 - line 1 is the "sides" member - then we can use the principle behind dimension travel in order to understand what happens when lines 2 and 5 are combined. So let's compare line 2 with line 3 - and think about how the motions of lines 1 and 1 would be affected!
Of course, if we try to implement the program for lines 2 and 5 ourselves, things don't work out quite as we have all been used to - because we can't move upwards, we can't reverse our motion downwards, and we can't reverse our motion upward! To make things real, let's take a look at the actual code for line 2 in C language, written by John Gruber for his book Programming With Objects! Here is the code in some detail:

float main {
    float c, r, t, r2;
    //
    // Program that starts from the center, moves up, then goes down
    // until it reaches the edge
    //
    c = 0.5;
    r = -5.5;
    r2 = c - r
    c2 = -(-r2);
    t2 = c2 + r2;
    c2 = (c2 - r2);
    r = (t1 + t2) / 2;
    //
    // Program that ends at the edge
    //
    return c;
}

If we compare these two programs, we see that the line 2 program never returns 0 - that is, the line will always be above the edge of the cube even if everything else doesn't get its final destination. Of course, this code is only possible because the line 1 program never returns -1! This means that lines 2 and 5 will never reach their destination together - that is, the program will never end!

So what's going on here? Because lines 1 and 1 don't "understand" each other and aren't able to "understand" each other, the fact that the line 2 program never returns 0 is due to the fact that lines 1 and 1 don't understand each other!

Of course, you can't change the nature of the physical world itself! So what has happened is we simply have

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict and understand what we have just learnt in this chapter, we will use a story from our favourite children's novel The Magician's Apprentice. It is a story about a magical apprentice who travels to various destinations within the boundaries of the same dimension as he does, using magic to cross over. However, once he reaches his destination, he discovers that he is now in reality outside of that dimension - like a true wizard!

How does this fit in with Einstein's theories of relativity?

So what about us? Well in other words, how would an entity enter the same dimension as the magician is in if they were to travel to the same destination? Well in order to travel to the destination of his own dimension (as stated above), the entity would need to have entered the same universe (which has the same dimensionality as his own); the problem is that no matter how much energy it has stored, it would not be capable of entering that dimension. However, if it somehow managed to do this, it would not be able to enter the same dimension! How would it do that?

Let's face it - the way we get around in 3D spacetime is totally different from our way of travelling around in 4D spacetime! And just because no matter how much physical energy an entity has stored in its body, it would be unable to enter into a different dimension from where it was sitting, it doesn't mean that it cannot enter other dimensions!
Let's start with the most basic case: that is, if an entity has been travelling around in our space-time during the entire duration of the story, what will happen if the entity is suddenly thrown into a different dimension at the start of this story (i.e. the person who initially placed the entity into our universe is now outside of that dimension) - would he be capable of still travelling around in the same dimension or will he fall and die?

Let's make a couple of important points before diving into this. Firstly, as long as the person who originally placed the entity into our universe has survived to this point, he would still be capable of entering his own dimensions. Secondly, even if he has lost all of his weight, he would still be able to travel around inside of his own dimensions - no matter how fast or how heavy he weighs, there is a constant gravitational potential that keeps him upright while he travels through the dimensions. As long as he is still capable of taking a leap of faith, he would be able to travel through our 4D universe! (And he wouldn't have to do so until the next episode...)

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the events that happen at the end of the previous chapter, I'll first introduce the Meadow Mage... as well as a few other characters that will provide interesting background as they relate to this particular chapter.

At first glance the Meadow Mage may seem like such a badass. She'll be our primary antagonist though - the evil witch herself! We'll soon learn that this is not quite true. At the end of The Magician's Apprentice we also encountered her, and the events that had happened had left her more determined than ever to return to power and take her family out of existence. In her final days, the Meadow Mage had begun to gain control of the rest of her family, and had started to act more and more like a regular human.
And we also learn that she is actually a member of the Meadow Mage family... and has the ability to manipulate the elements. This ability allows her to travel between different dimensions - literally! By using the power of the elements, she can control the earth, the fire, and the water to move her to whatever destination she wants to go to - the only problem is finding that destination!.

The first thing to note is that when a Meadow Mage travels, she simply leaves her current world and enters into another entirely. This is not a real part of everyday life - in fact - it is not even a known fact about us mortals! And in many ways it's quite incredible... not only that she has the ability to travel between dimensions, but that her ability has even become so commonplace that she became one of the only beings in existence - even the Meadow Mage family itself - to have the unique ability to do so - even without the knowledge of any of the other mortals or mages!

The only problem with this theory is that the way she does it requires her to leave her world just as she does - a real thing that we just don't have. Why does this matter? As we will see in the next couple of chapters below, the Meadow Mage is actually a creation of her family and the other mages! And while she's capable of just about anything, it is only possible that she could have had a limited knowledge of her own world and the other mages in it - which is why she has so much trouble finding out which way she needs to go! Because she doesn't know either!

But it is interesting to note that other mages that she encountered before were actually a part of her family, and that those mages were all the same. Now, what exactly are these other mages? What kind of creatures do they truly look like? And how did they become what they are? Let's start by taking a look at these other mages in their individual lives!

First up, there's Sven - who was originally from France. As a child, he learned that the way he felt and how he behaved was affected by how much electricity he was exposed to, and that his body was influenced by their environment. The Meadow Mage's power was just as much caused directly by their environment - this meant that if the Meadow Mage had a more intense experience of the elements, they'd feel more powerful and more able to manipulate the earth and fire and water. Sven was also able to "read" the feelings of other people - such as someone who couldn't see or hear, and even some of the Meadow Mage's familiars.

Sven's first encounter with the Meadow Mage was a bit different - instead of being a familiar, Sven was actually a servant! According to the wizarding society at the time, servant mages could only perform one of two things: travel or protect! The Meadow Mage chose travel, and was in her sixth dimension when she began her adventure - having only ever been familiar with the 5th and 4th dimensions.

When her mother came to see her, she told her that her father sent her to take charge of her family, and that she should look after them until they came to their own dimension! What she didn't tell her was... that if she lived in the other dimensions, she was no longer at risk of going back into the human world! Now of course this was true - because she would have to somehow return to their reality

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the question of how we can explain how God created the 4D universe has remained an enigma until quite recently! It is very possible that he did not design the Big Bang and everything that came after it - and it is also possible that he simply "worked" with the laws of nature to arrive at the first laws governing the creation of the universe. But both explanations are fairly improbable!

The first thing to note here is that there is an alternative to our theory of gravity. This alternative theory suggests that in fact the universe is a series of smaller worlds that all interact with each other and cause an expansion. Such an explanation, it turns out, is just fine for particles that stay very close to each other, and we are simply making the same mistake that we did with our initial theory of gravity: assuming that there is only one, big big cosmos, without considering the tiny worlds within it...

The basic argument is that when particles within a given universe form collisions, they cause their own energy to be absorbed into the mass of the colliding particles, and make them move faster. Eventually, this colliding energy will eventually build up to the point where the collisions will be too great to pass through their own smaller dimensions without absorbing more energy of their own in the process - and then the collisions end as a big "boom"! It's this energy that causes these small worlds to expand - and ultimately cause the Big Bang!

Unfortunately, although we can make an argument that implies God did indeed work with the laws of nature to create the universe (as well as other laws of physics that relate to the properties of things), it is impossible to support such an argument beyond present day technology - because even now we would only be looking at some of the tiny worlds in our universe, and we absolutely don't know what makes up the others! In fact, as we are now discovering ourselves within the universe, everything we know about the universe will come from watching the universe expand and expand! And as the universe continues to expand and expand, the universe will eventually become infinitely large - but it is completely beyond the current capabilities of research, and science today!

Another way of thinking about this is as follows: if there was only one big cosmos, everything would just be right...except for that thing called time...which happens to be an illusion! What we actually believe is the existence of a number of smaller worlds in our universe. And we are only looking at the visible part of these smaller worlds - and to put that in a more explicit way, it is not yet known if a single world is actually bigger than all of the others, and if so, if it really has all of the available resources to support it! Because of the fact that, because of the laws of nature, our universe has the ability to expand and expand, the smaller worlds may or may not actually get bigger over time...


Chapter Thirty Seven
Einstein and a Brief Trip To Dimension X

Here is the important part: Einstein himself was totally unaware of how we actually know about the universe! And in fact he only knew about some of the bigger worlds in space-time! But he knew for sure that it was the universe that grew after the Big Bang, because the creation of that explosion occurred in time, not the other way around...


The first time we see Einstein onscreen is in "The Eternal Struggle", where he explains that spacetime has 4 dimensions! It's amazing to see how little he knew about this theory! But this was before any other theories were invented, and, in the case of our theory of gravity, before any other theories were proposed! Therefore, Einstein was completely at home in his own little universe, the little universe of the Big Bang! He was even so convinced of how wonderful it was that he even decided to go to dimension X himself to study other universes...even if our 4D spacetime was obviously a bit more complicated than his own small world!

However, there is an alternative explanation for where Einstein was actually going; it involves a theory called Special Relativity, which was discovered and developed by Leonard Dirac (also known as Dirac-Heisenberg! You might be surprised at this, but Dirac-Heisenberg
