Yes, ultimately, the universe is flat; it doesn't have any corners or other special points that tell us anything about its complexity. However, there are some people who have believed that there must be a secret point somewhere out there. And they believe it is very much out there.

On October 17, 1999, the BBC reported a highly dramatic story about two mysterious men holding forth before an audience of 40,000 people in an Indian town in Punjab, India, which was held by villagers after an unexplained air raid. The men appeared to be about 60 years old, dressed in formal clothes, had bright red eyes, were high above the crowd, seemed to be talking to another man, seemed to have no history that connected them to the group, and spoke with an accent that did not necessarily match their gender. They also seemed to be carrying something or holding a sign that sounded like an unholy book.

The event soon attracted national and international attention and quickly became known as the "Padhe Bhagwat Disappearance". However, despite the fact that the men were not identified, reports came in at length describing their appearance. One report wrote, "The men were dressed in suits of black cloth, with a red hat and tie, and a black belt. They seemed to be about six feet tall, and had well defined, sharp features. Their hair was wavy and a reddish brown color and was flowing up the back of their head. Other reports said the men were black cloth suited men with tight tie, an African appearance and hair that resembled a woman's. One said they wore black or silver hats, and one said they were about 6' 5" tall. One of the men also carried a bag with a writing instrument, a small prayer book, and a large wooden statue of a Brahmin goddess."

According to the BBC, "It was rumored for years that the two men who were appearing at the village were from Kolkata, India, and that they had joined an elite group of followers who, after fleeing their home country in Pakistan in the 1970s, fled Calcutta in the 1990s. The group of followers came to Indian villages, usually by night and took up hiding in trees. According to them, this was only to escape the country's harsh economic situation. Some claimed they were from the Indian state of Odisha."

The BBC stated that "They were well dressed, and appeared to be very confident, and knew what they were doing. The villagers claimed they had a history, and were from a large family to boot, but they did not seem to know any family history, and it also appeared that the men were members and followers of a religious sect".

What makes these men mysterious? Well, one person interviewed said that "somewhere in the region an incident happened which led to the deaths of many of the community's elders. Some of the dead were believed to be related to the men. The dead were believed to be living in villages which were under the heel of the men. While the men were believed to be hiding in the forests with the dead, no one had been able to locate the trees where the men were believed to have committed the crime. But one of the men claimed that on one occasion a family member had gone to them and told him that the family members of the dead had gone for an evening walk. However, when the family members came back the next day, they found the dead. They thought to have killed the dead, but their mistake was the family members of those dead had come back, without the corpses of those dead. Some family members were able to locate the trees so that they could kill the men. Because of this the bodies of the men were found by some locals..."

It also says that the reports "also came in at length describing their appearance. One report said, 'The men were dressed in suits of black cloth, with a red hat and tie, and a black...' However, these men had a similar look to the famous designer of Christian Haute Couture Balenciaga, he was known as one of the best designers of fashion today. He was also a Christian and belonged to the Catholic Church. The man whose story was mentioned was not from the caste of Pandits,

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the only thing that exists is Nature! Which means we can never truly know what is a deity until we see what it really is - but until we do that, we can't know what it is possible to become... until we learn about how to make it! :)

In physics, it is very common to study the relationships among certain concepts. For example, many mathematicians will make statements about mathematical relationships that cannot be proven mathematically yet, because they can't quite get them yet. Intuitively, these statements seem like they contradict one another. Thus, we need to understand these mathematical relationships and how we should formulate them in order to prove them mathematically.

Now let's examine some mathematical examples from everyday life - like the relationship between a line and angles. Let's first look at an example from physics!

To begin our discussion of the relationship between angles, let's examine some very basic examples that are used throughout mathematics.

Take a little piece of paper, say a square or some other shaped piece of paper. You can cut it with scissors and find that it measures approximately 0.5 x 0.5 (actually it's more like approximately 0.64 x 0.64, but for simplicity we'll be referring to these two values as equally accurate). This paper would look like the right angle in our 3D world...

But now we can manipulate this paper in a very different way - by cutting a straight line between the two half squares together through the center...and you'll notice that this line will exactly measure the exact same length as the original paper!

What we are seeing here is the relationship between a line and angles. Take some paper and hold it against one side of a table or in the air with your hands. Then hold the perpendicular portion of the line to the table / sheet of paper with your hands as well - it'll be very interesting to see what happens! Then, you could hold the line straight up and find the same answer...

Finally, let's turn to another example from physics! Take a piece of a paper and form it into a triangle (or a triangle-like shape) - we'll call it "the triangle"! Now try to use a ruler to measure the length of the triangle! You'll be seeing a great deal of math in this example! If you take the base of your ruler - or the half of the ruler that is above you - and hold it up, you'll see a very small triangle that measures approximately 0.003 x 0.002 x 0.005 (or approximately 1.0 x 2.0 x 3.0...again with the same basic math you learned until this point!). You see, the triangle is the exact same shape as the square you used to measure...which is wonderful!

And from physics, the relationship between lines and angles is also very interesting! Take a piece of paper that you cut with your fingers - a strip of paper that is approximately 0.5 x 0.5 cm (or even smaller - if you really have a sharp knife, we could cut the paper even smaller than this!). Just try holding this paper like you do with the horizontal line you just cut, holding it perpendicular to a table - you'll find that the length of the vertical line is exactly the same as the length of the horizontal line! You can make even smaller strips of paper and get the same result, so we should just stop and say that lines and angles are not just two things but actually the same thing! :)

All that being said, it is important to understand that it may not be possible - at least not by our current tools, to find out the exact answer to questions like "What is a deity"? And there are many other areas in the universe of which we don't currently have any insight. So in order to be able to make such important questions, we need to find a way to learn about them and understand how much they contribute to science...but only if we can solve the puzzles that arise as we go!

So let's try and find the answer to "What is a deity" using different strategies. Let's use mathematics to figure out a relationship between the lines and angles that you just talked about - let's make some definitions! We'll start off by defining our line to be:

Let L be any 3x3 matrix representing a

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the universe is filled with strange and wonderful secrets. For example, our very existence as individuals is all in large part a mystery (though perhaps not entirely so in many ways, such as our evolution). But that doesn't mean that we should give up on the study of the universe's mysteries, or our own existence's as well!

Now when it comes to higher dimensions, the mystery surrounding space-time itself continues. Of course, in our brief journey to understand the complexities of the universe we've come to know a great deal about the structure of spacetime itself. But that is not the end of the story. There are still some more mysteries and amazing discoveries to keep us on our toes!

In this chapter we will be exploring how to use Einstein's theory of relativity to help uncover all sorts of mysteries and discoveries concerning the universe. And to help us better prepare ourselves for whatever lurks on the other side!


A:

If we are inside one of the dimensions (or more...), and the distance between that dimension and the ground is shorter than the length of a human hair, we would be able to travel very far off the ground and would be free to experience acceleration, at least theoretically.
The real question isn't whether space-time is four-dimensional or not, but whether physics (or whatever theory of particle physics) allows us to travel along one dimension at a time.
To answer that definitively, we need an answer to a question that is equally important to all physics (or any theory of particles) - what are the fundamental forces?

A:

Your idea that the Universe as a whole is infinite is a little bit wrong. It would look exactly as you imagine, but the reality is that the amount of space (or even only what we see) is finite. That is, there is only a finite number of dimensions. The universe is not infinite, but it is very small. And, we are currently in only one of these dimensions.
If you look at the Big Bang, it will look exactly as you imagine, but in reality it will appear to go down from an infinitely high level, but will return to a bigger level before ending.  There is also some interesting debate among experimentalists and mathematicians about the existence and duration of the Big Bang. (See this interesting answer.)
The Big Bang actually only made visible part of the total number of dimensions, but we see everything. And, part of the dimensions is still hidden. But the main problem is whether we can travel along one dimension at a time. In other words, if you can travel infinitely fast and not experience any force, is it true that the universe as a whole is infinite?

A:

You probably agree with me that the universe as a whole is infinitely vast and infinitely complex, not only in space, but in all of its dimensions.
However, the universe as a whole is finite in each of its dimensions.  And, that is why we are only seeing some parts of it at any given time.
Given that, it seems that it would indeed be possible to travel to other regions of space, but only by traveling along one spatial dimension at a time.
I think the answer to your question, then, will simply boil down to a simple choice:
If the universe is infinite in space but finite in time, then each spatial dimension (and perhaps also time dimension, depending on the physics), it would still be possible to travel across it without any time pressure. In other words, the time dimension would still need to be accelerated by another force.
If we are inside one of the spatial dimensions and the time dimension is shorter than a human hair length, then we could travel over it from one side.  But we could also make a loop around it, and return to the other side. This is because we can only return from a smaller region to a bigger region. (Think of, for example, the Earth as the smaller dimension.)
If we were only inside one spatial dimension but not inside another, then we could always travel between the two dimensions - the other would only be there to be seen.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexities and subtleties that exist between humans and machine understanding, math and computer science provide a fascinating platform for scientists to learn more about how humans think. In the last few chapters, I've outlined a new method to understand math: EnFJ thinking, an ability that allows us to understand math and physics in a way that machines can no longer.

As I mentioned earlier, we also have an ability to enFJ thinking - which I believe to be one of the most advanced cognitive processes in the human brain, allowing us to understand much more complicated ideas and concepts using basic principles of math and physics.

For an introduction to EnFJ thinking, see this article and this previous post:

EnFJ Thinking Revisited: An Introduction to the EnfJ Mental Math Reasoning Construct

If you were to take an elevator from a room with an attached observation deck to an adjacent room without an attached observation deck, you would experience some degree of sensory motion. Would this be a result of the elevator spinning the entire length of the room? Would you notice this as well? Well according to EnFJ thinking, the sensory motion of the elevator and the experience of watching someone else move the elevator in a different way aren't actually related - the elevator does experience sensory motion, but it is due to the observation of someone else moving it in a different way!

As you continue to explore the power of intuition in mathematical proofs and discovering new areas of scientific insights, you'll soon come to appreciate both the mathematics that underpins science and what it means to truly understand what is going on behind the scenes in our world.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict some of your friends, I need to explain a couple of concepts. First, and most importantly, let's define the word "positive". A person who is truly positive simply means that they are a cheerleader of any kind, not a person who is obsessed with any negative thing. That's why it's a good idea to start with this definition. A negative emotion is something that one is in a position to choose to be sad, unhappy, frustrated, or angry.  On the other hand, a positive emotion is something that is completely a choice of the person. You will see some negative emotions that aren't categorized as positive, but people tend to fall into this category too. When we use the word "positive", we're simply referring to emotions which are positively valued by those who experience them - not those which are negatively valued.

Let's now review some cognitive functions that may be helpful in understanding math - this is a topic where the concept of dimension is very important. In these cognitive tests, you will be asked to make a mathematical proposition and describe it by a single line. You will then be asked to evaluate the mathematical proposition by comparing it with the same proposition described by one of your friends' lines. Math is a very difficult subject! And even when we are just beginning to learn math, we often need help with several mathematical concepts at the same time. This is where the concept of dimension becomes very important! If we could somehow combine math with a friend's line, then we would have perfect access to their concept and ability! The problem is that many students simply can't learn math without having to know the definition of all of the concepts involved.
So here are some mathematical concepts you will be able to use:  addition, subtraction, subtraction and addition, multiplication, division, inverse square root, trigonometry, and division and addition

We all know the basics of addition and subtraction easily. However, in addition and subtraction, you will be asked to add two numbers into a series. In addition, the numbers will be added together to build up the base or base of the addition; in subtraction, you will be asked to subtract two numbers from a series. You will see that the series will still continue adding while the base is being subtracted, but this time the resulting numbers would be smaller.

So while the above concepts are quite simple, one thing you won't see is how to use addition and subtraction to create different geometric forms. For example, you can add 2 together to create the line that goes from one end of the circle to the other. However, when you subtract 2 from that line, you get two new lines that go from the "center of the circle" of the original line to one side of the circle, and from the other side of the circle to the other side of the circle - which is what you need so that the circle is larger? In this way, addition and subtraction are useful for combining and combining two separate parts into one.

As we explore this concept of division and multiplication with our friends, we will discuss different forms of division and multiplication. First up is the following arithmetic formula: 2 (a+b) = a + b or, in other words, the product of two numbers, a and b, is equal to their sum divided by their product. Note that this division does not need to be done in reverse!

One of the more popular additions to math is multiplication. In addition to being easy to add or subtract two numbers, it is useful in a number of other ways, such as combining them to create numbers that are greater than one, or combining them to create other numbers from the same or different numbers.

Lastly, we need to discuss subtraction and division. A subtraction and division is a mathematical way of combining several numbers that aren't directly divisible together. For example, you can subtract 1 from a decimal number (that would be 5.9987) to get the corresponding binary sum: 4, but you could also subtract 5 from 5.9987 and get 5.9987 + 4. The latter method is commonly referred to as "divide-by-zero".

Now let's consider some simple mathematical games. First, there is the one where you have two numbers whose sum

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of understanding deities, let's start with a visualisation of the mind of a human that uses mathematics to formulate answers to the questions we asked in Chapter 1. To do so we have created a human model of the mind we created in Chapter Nine. This model is based on the "mathematical mind." From this model we created an avatar with the exact traits that could represent a deity. You can see in the figure at the lowest right hand side that we chose human hair as our primary form's hair colour. This gives you a decent idea about the shape of the avatar.

Using the mathematics of mathematics, we created this avatar by dividing the "mathematical mind" into two separate regions. The first region was all of the mathematical thinking abilities that we found helpful in answering all of our questions. Some of these abilities include: using mathematical notation and equations to understand language; using mathematical formulae to understand mathematical language; using mathematical reasoning and logic-based thinking to solve problems; understanding the nature of the universe; investigating principles and theories of the physical world.

The second region was all of the mathematical reasoning abilities found in the human brain that made it difficult for us to figure out the meaning of our questions. These abilities include: using mathematical language to think about what we are trying to say; using mathematical reasoning to find a solution to the problem; using mathematical formulae to find solutions to problems; using mathematical reasoning to evaluate solutions to problems.

This way we separated out the mind of the human to help illustrate the "mathematical mind" that we needed to learn. At first glance we might say that this separation is too much for humans, as we have seen that they have very limited memory. To take a closer look, however, the split of mathematics by region is quite interesting. The brain of a human being, for instance, can store around 3,500,000,000,000 mathematical formulae! That's just huge chunks of information!

Furthermore, the mathematical mind is a very complicated brain that uses a lot of specialized neurons. In this sense the mathematical mind has a higher complexity compared to us, as only humans are capable of processing such a huge amount of information. However, humans have a much smaller scale of representation and processing capabilities as compared to machines!

Finally, there are just so many different mathematical formulae that humans can use when solving problems that we can only assume that humans have a deep understanding of what they are doing. In other words, given a small mathematical problem, humans can figure out the solution!

At this point we begin to see how our avatar resembles most of the mathematical mind. However, unlike most of the mathematical mind that we created before, the avatar we created actually does have real thoughts in it! Let's consider our avatar's feelings - it can only be a 3 dimensional mind; the avatar's feelings (feelings like anger, sadness, sadness) are not allowed by most of the mathematical mind that we have created before. As you can see above, we don't have control over the avatar's thoughts - the thoughts come to us as we speak or read - and come from the "mathematical mind"! It seems extremely strange and mysterious to allow a third dimensional entity to have feelings! It would be like telling a mouse to feel pain...perhaps we should look at something we don't have control over!

So, as we continue to look into what happens when an entity enters into a different dimension than its native dimension, we start to realise that we should be concerned with how humans can behave in a different dimension. Our avatar clearly resembles the mathematical mind in how it deals with math equations, but it doesn't have the emotional side! As we continue to learn more about the complexity and capabilities of these entities, we start to understand that we must ensure that our knowledge and understanding of mathematics is not just limited to using and understanding mathematical equations! We must also consider the emotional side, as well!

Now of course it's important that we get into all the terminology for the rest of this chapter!

A:

The reason that the human mind is so complex - a lot easier that our computer is to understand - is that humans have more brains and have had to evolve the brain.
We humans have about 6000000 neurons per cerebellum

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict these topics in depth, we will now discuss some general concepts and terms that will appear in every lesson. For this section, we will be using a slightly different approach to text. Instead of giving the students a hard time by discussing only the definitions or making general references to the content in each chapter, we will give specific examples that allow the students to understand what they are learning.

As was noted in the previous chapter, there are different forms of mathematics - algebraic number theory, functional analysis, algebraic geometry, etc. - that each give us specific concepts and techniques for dealing with a specific problem.

Let's take a look at these two areas of mathematics and see how students relate to them. Then we'll go on to discuss which tools students would need to be able to solve problems in one or the other.

Number Theory: Basic Concepts of Number Theories

Let's start by understanding how a number is defined. The number that we use throughout this section is simply the concept of a rational number. This can be understood much more easily as follows. Let's imagine a straight piece of paper - let's call it "A" - with one small, black hole inside. The hole would create a bunch of lines (called "surfaces") - one at a time - that run through the entire paper, one above another, and always keep moving in the same direction, from left to right.

Now let's take a piece of paper "B" that is a different length. This paper would be approximately square. On the opposite side of our paper "B" would be a black hole with one small hole in it, much the same size as our "A" paper. The hole would create one big plane, which would be called a "surface plane" (note that these surfaces are always moving in the same direction, from left to right). Now let's take another piece of paper 'C' that is approximately half our paper "A" - roughly half the length, half the width. Let's call the hole in this second paper "D". This hole would create the surface plane of our paper 'C' from inside the hole in our original paper "A". So when we cut this paper out, it will resemble a square.

To make this example as easy to understand as possible, let's imagine that the size of our "A" paper is about one tenth of the size of the hole in our "A" paper. So let's assume that the holes in our "B" and 'C' paper are much, much smaller. Let's also assume that the hole in our "A" paper is approximately one tenth of the size of our hole in our "A" paper. Let's also assume that our hole in our "A" can be rotated to any point on the circle, because the hole would only create a surface. Since this circle is an imaginary circle, its center is a point of zero rotation, let's just call this point the zero point (or zero radius for short). We can now use the circle to construct two different number planes that intersect as shown:

Now let's consider how this intersection creates a rational number. First, note that because the intersection of the lines is not in the middle, each point on our number line will have a negative curvature. So there are negative areas where we don't know the sign or value of the number. So, let's construct a diagram that looks like this - assuming that our "A" hole has the value 1 in the middle of the number line, and we take a negative and then a positive number, we get a circle that is less than 1 because negative sign has a curvature of -1.

Now let's look at the difference between two numbers on this circle: $1-$ and "$1$" - these two numbers are represented by two different shapes on the graph above. Notice how the difference between these two numbers decreases as the circles overlap each other. Therefore, $1-$ has a smaller value than $1$" - the difference between them is equal to $2$. This shows us that $1-$ is less than or equal to $1$" (because of the negative curvature of the negative area of the circle). This implies that $1-$ > $1$" - but we know this already, so this part of the discussion is over!

Now let's consider how one would interpret this intersection to obtain our result. Let us start with the intersection of zero and one line - we're assuming the

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this chapter I am going to use a metaphor, like a carrot and stick situation where I like to use. The carrot is not necessarily a solid substance, but rather an idea: an idea that is useful to one and not useful to other people. The stick is, for us mortals, an exacting or unreasonably complicated task that we need to complete to make the carrot stick!
So let's imagine a stick that has four sides: length x, width x, breadth x, thickness x. In this situation there might be only two kinds of actions that we can perform using it, which are throwing and picking. These tools are commonly used in the real world when someone needs to take care of their loved ones in nursing homes. Throwing is a fairly straight forward task, and one can quickly reach any target without ever lifting the carrot off the stick! However, picking, on the other hand, is more sophisticated and requires you to lift up the carrot and pull the stick in a certain direction! As you can see, this task is extremely difficult! I will illustrate this later by having my readers imagine performing this task in more detail.

This stick is meant to be picked. After you pick it up, the carrot side is still on the stick (as we are right now), but the stick's other sides (the length and width) are on the ground. Now look at the right side of the carrot. The length of the sides is still set to length and is still on the stick, but the width is not yet fixed and is somewhere in between length and width! So the carrot is lifted up and the stick is pulled up in a straight line in the direction of length. After the carrot has reached the straight line end, it will drop down and fall off the stick! Note that the carrot is still facing up (similar to Figure 8.14.1, which shows the direction where the carrot is picked up, but I have left out the figure because of its length)....

Now if you think about this situation, I think that even when someone is at a great distance and is unable to reach their carrot with the picked up sticks, they still need to look in front to see if their carrot is on their stick. In other words...if they have done all the same things, they still need to look around to see if they have picked up their carrot. So you can see that throwing, in some cases, is actually a very hard task to perform, and it takes practice. On the other hand, picking up a carrot is a much easier thing as it only takes one action and all the carrot is on the side of the stick.

Now when someone is trying to perform the work depicted in Figure 6.29.3, they do a few simple tasks to prepare the stick. The first one is to hold up the carrot and the length of the carrot side towards the stick. The carrot is then thrown against the length and the stick is then picked up. This is actually quite basic and the reason I do not show it in Figures 6.29.1 and 6.29.2 because the work is very similar, but in these figures there is a small difference in the location of the carrot.

When your carrot lands on your stick (Figure 6.29.3), the other side of the carrot should be facing up. If you wish to lift the carrot up, you should first pull the carrot up in a straight line and then pick up the carrot side again. As you can see, when the carrot is on the stick, the carrot's position cannot change anytime quickly because it is hanging off the side of the stick by a thin line (I have omitted the length and the width here because, once again, it's just a simple straight line, see Figure 6.29.4)

In this situation, the carrot is lifted up again (Figure 6.29.4), and now the carrot side is pointing upward. Once again, this simple action creates a thin line (Figure 6.29.5) in front of the carrot side which must be

## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of thinking, one should understand how it works. Mathematics provides the natural language to describe all the other concepts discussed in this chapter. It's an effective way to explain a large part of our brains - and it certainly provides a useful way of understanding and predicting the behavior of particles that travel through various dimensions.

When we speak of thoughts or ideas about objects, we are referring to those which we hold inside our heads and not the actual objects that we are describing. In math, this means that the concept of thinking refers to all thoughts that relate to our perception of objects. Think of the picture below as a small version of your brain:

Imagine that you wish to use this concept to describe the behavior of an object that is in contact with a blackboard, similar to the one in the picture. However, the blackboard is not exactly black. Instead, it reflects a light from the sun and falls down on the surface of the paper, which is called a transparent plane. A particle, such as light, would now enter the blackboard while traveling through a spatial dimension - you can imagine the particle being able to see through it - but it would not be able to directly affect the other properties of the blackboard - like what its edges or materials are.

Now imagine that you move from Point A to Point B - and that you then place a square over Point B. You are then able to see the square as it was moved through 3D space. In order to see the square, your brain has first "viewed the transparent plane" at Point B; then it has "viewed" the point where the square should physically lay on the transparent plane - which is called the point where the square should be placed - and then it has "viewed" the particle that is travelling through the dimension that is a little different from the transparent plane - for example - a new dimension of light. However, this 3D dimension also changes the shape of the square - so our brain could still identify the square as a square if it moved through the first dimension of light.
Imagine now that this same particle enters into another dimension - say Dimension X - and that Dimension X has more curvature than Dimension Y. As you move your square through Dimension X, so does the square break into pieces until it comes to rest on the surface of the transparent plane - which is called the original surface. Now imagine that you are able to use the same mechanism to describe the square's behavior in Dimension X: when you move the square through Dimension X, the square breaks into pieces until it comes to rest on the original surface; and when it comes to this original surface, the square comes to rest in an exact position on that surface. You could see this if we made a version of the picture above on the transparent black board; you could see that the particles would still "view" the square when travelling down a Dimension X, but that they would not be able to "view" each of the other dimensions of the transparent board!

When we refer to thinking, we describe thoughts/ideas about objects that relate to our perception of objects. In math, we are referring to all thoughts that relate to the perception of objects and all of those thoughts that are affected by particles travelling through spacetime. These thoughts can be referred to as cognitions, because they are made up of thoughts that relate to our perception of the objects and the thoughts that are affected by particles travelling through the 4D spacetime that is known as spacetime or 3D space in some forms. Of course, this doesn't mean that thinking is essentially a list of thoughts about objects and particles (and other things you mention as well), it just means that this is the cognitive thought process that you are describing.

Now, we could begin to see how understanding thinking is much easier using mathematics. It's not really a hard subject to understand mathematically and it doesn't take a lot of time to do so. Let's start with an example.

(In fact, many of the concepts discussed in this chapter involve mathematical principles; for example, the idea that particles can travel through 3+1 dimensional space, is often described as a mathematical principle in some form.) Imagine something that has a mass and an energy. If I have a piece of paper with this mass

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what mathematics is all about, let's first look at the basic concepts and principles related to it. In this section we will go over some basic concepts in basic algebra, linear algebra, linear systems, and matrix theory. These topics are important because they play an important role in understanding how mathematics works...

To find out more about this topic, see our textbook chapter on Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory, the first of the two that will follow...


Introduction to Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory - Introduction

From the previous chapter in this series, we know how linear equations and linear systems are described in a matrix form. Similarly, we will now look at how matrixes are described as a collection of equal sized numbers, called rows, and their values called columns. We'll discuss how matrices relate to linear equations and linear systems, and we'll answer some basic questions about these topics. In order to get the most out of this section, you should always check the chapter on Advanced Linear Algebra. We're hoping this one gets you used to thinking with matrices rather than just vectors and linear combinations in your minds...

Let's start with the first topic from this course, which is linear equations. As an introduction, it is best to start with some of the most fundamental equations - the ones which describe each of many relationships between variables. These equations will then serve as the basis for a lot of linear systems' and matrix equations that follow; in the next few sections we'll explore linear systems in more detail but for now, let's focus on linear equations.

For any two linear equations, the product of the two equations is the intersection of the two equations, i.e., it's the right hand side minus the left hand side (or x-y = 0 if you prefer!).

In other words, if we're given two equations; the product of the left hand sides of these equations - i.e., the intersection of the two equations - will be equal to the right hand side minus the left hand side. Therefore, the product of any two linear equations is equal to both of the equations. You might be surprised to see that a set of two linear equations can give the same result even though the equations could be represented by different forms! This is called equivalence and you will see more of it in an upcoming article in this series that covers basic concepts in this topic...

In addition to equivalence, there are other techniques used by mathematicians and scientists to determine which set of equations are equivalent. Some popular techniques are described in more detail below...

In short, the problem here is to determine what two sets of equations have the same result. In mathematical terms, we're trying to find a mapping that establishes how two sets of equations can be mapped into the same set of equations. The simplest possible mapping technique would simply be to map each equation to its own corresponding column; this is called direct mapping. Unfortunately, this technique isn't as intuitive as we would like it to be, and because of this it doesn't always result in the same answer as direct mapping. We will see about one of its possible uses later, in which we apply this technique to two sets of equation: the solutions of two equations

Now let us try doing a little more research on linear equations and see how we can figure out which other methods are applicable. If you were to look at an equation written out like this:

you should find that you can determine if the result of an equation is zero or not simply by looking at the coefficients of the equation. You can also find out if an equation has a single solution by taking the product of the column numbers - i.e., solving each equation for one of the columns: x and y.

However, it is not so easy for you to determine if a set of four equations is equivalent to a set of two equations as some of the equations have multiple solutions, i.e., (a*x+ b*y) = 0 for an example. (In fact, four equal sized vectors don't have zeroes in common!) In other words, it is sometimes challenging to determine whether a set of equations describes a system, or whether a set of equations is equivalent to another set of equations. Fortunately, though, there is an easy way to determine whether two sets of equations have the same number of solutions....

One useful way

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of mathematics, we will introduce a brief history of how it developed over time. This section will describe how mathematics relates to mathematics education and some of the research that is being completed today about mathematics education.

How Do I Learn Mathematics?
As mentioned earlier, many of our mental abilities come through our education. This includes a range of mathematical concepts like addition, subtraction numbers, etc. However, what is often omitted is the fact that math is only one part of our mental abilities. Math is much more than a set of facts to be memorized. Math is an art form that teaches us how to solve problems.

Mathematics Is Not Just Finding the Facts
You might think that math is like chess - all it does is guess. Unfortunately, this is not the case! Math is much more than simply guessing: when we solve a problem we develop strategies to solve (or "plan" to solve) a new problem! In other words, solving problems requires the ability to reason logically and apply experience and logic.

Why Is Math Important?
One reason why math matters is because it is the basis of science and technology. Math is the science of numbers and how they work. It is the engine that powers the power and motion that we often find in technology. Math is also the foundation of business, commerce, economics, finance, and other areas of life.

Maths Has Huge Potential
In order to make it in the real world, we will must be able to predict and manipulate quantities such as masses, velocities, and even how things feel. To be a successful entrepreneur, you will need to be able to use math to do business, to solve problems and even predict the results.

There is Much More to Understanding Mathematics
It is important to remember that mathematics is about understanding mathematics. There are innumerable reasons to learn math - it is an excellent way to learn about the world, to study subjects such as science, psychology, and political science, and to gain an excellent idea of our everyday world.

Learning Mathematics Is Important To My Life
I am learning to love learning math all the time. In general it is a topic I enjoy learning about and to study as part of my studies. I believe that learning about math will help me make better decisions. I think that math is necessary for a person to be a successful person. If you don't love learning math, then you might not study hard enough. And I believe that is true!

Many of Us Have A Problem With Mathematics
What we do not realize is that we have a problem with math. As mentioned earlier, we have trouble working with mathematics and think that we cannot do it! This is where learning math comes into the picture: We need to change our perception of math - understand what mathematics is all about and what our abilities are.

How Does Mathematics Improve the Brain?
Many of the many benefits of taking math classes have been tied to the brain. In particular, the study of math has shown to enhance the thinking process by improving our math skills. However, studies have also shown that the mind can also be a tool for improving the brain function.

If We Can Use Mathematics For Good, How Do We Do It?
Math has the ability to improve the health of the mind, the body, and the environment. It can also benefit people in other ways - it can help people with various disorders like autism, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Math can also help people solve problems that they didn't think could be solved at all...all this while improving their memory and concentration.
So the answer would appear to be, just get the math out of your life!

Let's Put Math Behind The Wheel
Just because math is about math - and it does have huge potential to help enhance how our brains work - doesn't mean that all of our math skill will always improve. It may be that we'll stop working with certain kinds of mathematics - the kind that was designed for high schools! Even if we're learning math for fun and to help us gain new skills, we may stop practicing to maintain our strengths in certain areas of math. The biggest example is the mathematics that is usually taught in schools. This is where we learn how to do many math things with no real interest

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict our knowledge system, let's look further at our subconscious mind. In this section we will explore five of the most commonly studied personality types - the NEO-PI-3 personality inventory for the past few years, which is a relatively new attempt at a measure of personality based on the structure and function of the subconscious mind (and we will be revisiting that in a few week's time). We will primarily examine the theory behind personality types using these five personality types as an example.
What the NEO-PI-3 personality inventory does exactly? Well it measures the personality types, or "endops" to use its own words. Basically, each personality type has two sets of personality traits: positive and negative.

So let's consider the personality types one at a time. The five personality types we are looking at are each comprised of a unique set of these traits. In other words, they have a set of traits that makes them the type that they are. Let's say that this was the case for these four personality traits:

I am ambitious, confident, independent, and a team player

There are two sub-types for each of these four personality traits; one is called "Meaning" and the other is called "Directness." Each of these personality traits is defined by two adjectives.  They describe each set of traits and show it on a scale from 0 to 100. You can view the data you have collected using the NEO-PI-3.
Now let's imagine that you were to have been asked to choose one of the four traits to describe you as - meaning, directness, and ambition- and then have measured the trait for the set of individuals from whom you were asked to collect the data. How would you get an overall view of the various personality traits in each one of these sub-types? Well, there is no set way to answer the question, because each person has his or her own unique personality traits that help to make them who they are. And any set of personality traits you find might be a mixture of the different traits people in your sub-types have...
The answer is that if people have high levels of both Directness and ambition, and low levels of meaning, then we can conclude that they are very likely to be creative, ambitious, innovative, and innovative! On the other hand, if either of the two personality traits is relatively low (such as low level of Directness), then we know we will find people who are less creative, ambitious, and innovative - not exactly the type of person you're looking for...?

What does this tell us about how we create ourselves out of this seemingly contradictory set of personality traits? As we explore the other endops- personality sub-types, we will see that the results are quite interesting. 
An endop that is high in both ambition and directness (and low in meaning) can be considered to be the leader. A high endop in directness may be able to make plans quickly, and a high endop in ambition may be able to complete his or her plans without hesitation - but both traits are going to lead to an overly ambitious/aristocratic personality. On the other hand, if an endop is very low in both ambition and directness - meaning, low in both meaning and directness - then we can conclude that he or she is introverted and unable to communicate effectively - not exactly the type of person we want from a leader! As the personality sub-types unfold, we also see how each one of them comes to be...a great leader for a brief period of time, but a very bad leader for the rest of time.

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the idea of NLP (Non-Linguistic Programming), let us consider a simple example...
Let's say we are planning a picnic for a day out. We have thought about several foods that we might want to include on the agenda - a cheese platter, sausages, chicken nuggets, etcetera. We'll eventually choose to be out at a theme park with music being played - hence the use of Hip Hop NLP as a guide to the planning! Well first off, what is Hip Hop NLP? Well, it's the combination of (1) hypnotism, (2) the law of attraction, and (3) the concept of play! You can think of it as some sort of "hip hop" technique to learn to communicate more effectively to your audience - it involves hypnotizing people, letting them make up playful language, and providing them with a "hook story" by using theatrics. The goal is to create such a story that allows your audience to share a better version of themselves while also understanding that a playful approach is very important in communicating with your audience!
If you look at the next part of our example, the goal for your picnic is to get your family and friends together to enjoy you as a dad or an uncle! Well it turns out that your only family member's only concern is getting the best possible time with her - this allows her to focus on her own needs! This makes a perfect hip hop hook story for you! The next person on that list will be your neighbor, who can then come up with some playful language about how much he enjoys her company and how much he would like to spend more time with her! Of course your best friend will also make a hip hop hook story about how much he appreciates your friendship, how excited he is to be with you, and how much fun he would like to share your newfound friendship! Finally, your co-worker will come up with a story about how much fun it is working at your company and how much fun the new members of your team have having one another around! Well the entire group has finally met and got toget together for an awesome picnic! It is all about the "fun!"

Now imagine the situation:

Every time a new person joins the group, everyone is happy to share more stories as they relate to each other. Now they have no idea that most people don't really have very deep feelings for people they know in person, and often they only see who are nice or fun to hang with at work, at a bar, at the library, etcetera. They feel like it is a good way to make new friends, but don't know about deep, meaningful friendships! How about if we change all of this?
Well we will take a look at the example provided earlier to better understand this concept:

"There used to be a time when my grandmother and grandfather lived near each other. Both of them were born in the same village and grew up in one small community - the village we used to call Mango. The only difference is that my grandmother grew up there, while my grandfather moved to be near a nearby town. That was some thirty years ago. I will never forget that trip to Mango because it taught me to accept people as they are. In other words, I am not going to try to pick on anyone because they don't like me. I am going to learn to accept them and to be a nice person to them. My grandmother taught me to be friendly, the kind of person that everyone wants to be with. That's what I'm going to do!"

Now you might be wondering: what if we add my father to this list? Well, first off, we have to add a negative tone to this story so that we get the appropriate impression we are creating. We also want to add an emotional aspect because it is what is happening inside my grandparents that has motivated them to tell the story, rather than their parents or sibling. The emotional aspect is the driving force behind the story! Let's look at some sample words for use on the topic:

I know that this is not your favorite family!
My grandma has just come for a visit to her village
She might have

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the nature of the universe has a lot in common with higher dimensional physics. Even when one considers only space, there are many forms to describe the material properties of the cosmos. One is particle theory, which states that every single particle in our universe consists of a number of elementary particles of unknown properties. In particular, those elementary particles would have very short trajectories and be extremely strong, almost like electrons being accelerated around protons. One more fundamental property of particles is their strong coupling to one another - just like molecules in a regular molecular polymer would be very strong interacting. In this sense, our universe could very well resemble some of the properties of higher dimensional physics, and if so, this does imply that all of our fundamental laws and rules of physics are also applicable in higher dimensions. This can be verified experimentally if the existence of higher dimensions is proved - and many believe that such a universality exists! How else could we explain the existence of a large number of physical phenomena that seem so fundamental to us?

One of the important mysteries about the universe is whether the fundamental laws and rules of ordinary universe-specific physics apply universally to higher dimensional physics. For example, at the microscopic level, the laws of atomic physics can be applied to higher dimensions. Many physical phenomena at the macroscopic level may simply be explained by the existence of higher dimensional objects - atoms having many dimensions, molecules many more dimensions, etc. However, it is difficult to prove the existence of higher dimensions, because they are difficult to directly visualize and measure. However, there are certain things about higher dimensions that have to be in order! In particular, objects in these dimensions should be invisible - and that means they're not material, but rather energy. The main reason for this is that spacetime can't be described using matter alone!
Furthermore, higher dimensional entities should be much larger - this would allow spacetime to be significantly smaller and thus more compact.

Now we are ready to explore an area of physics that has not received much attention historically! In particular, we will explore whether higher dimensional physics could be explained using the laws and rules of classical physics. To do this, we will explore the following scenario:

Our universe is described by a single spatial dimension - the same dimension we experience in our ordinary 4D world. In these 2+1 dimensional spaces, there may exist higher dimensions, where there is no boundary between the space-time and which are described by very small spaces.

Let's say we were to examine particles in this lower dimensional universe and see what effect they would have on other higher dimensional objects! Well, according to conventional physics, at the microscopic level, such particles cannot pass through any boundary between the spaces, and thus they will appear to be purely 1+1 dimensional entities. And at the macroscopic level, even if they were to appear to be purely 1D objects, as time goes on, they would begin to behave like higher dimensional objects! This is because they are interacting at the microscopic and macroscopic scales of both domains. Of course, higher dimensional objects would be infinitely more compact than their lower dimensional counterparts, but the point is, if we were to examine these objects in both higher and lower dimensions, and assume they would behave the same way in both dimensions, we would actually be looking at similar types of objects - only they would be infinitely larger! Thus if we assume that higher dimensionality is possible, it actually seems more reasonable to assume that lower dimensionality is possible and therefore higher dimension would be also possible.
If we then apply these laws and rules of physics to higher dimensions, then would our universe be a lower dimensionality version of our 4D universe, similar to how lower dimensional particles in a 3D universe would have no effect on higher-dimensional particles? Why should not their effects be similar? The answer is pretty simple - the energy that we would associate with a higher dimensional object would be infinitely smaller than that of a lower dimensional object, and thus it would have infinitely less effect on our lower dimensional world!
Of course, the fact that our 4D universe is larger than its lower dimensional counterparts actually makes the differences between our lower dimensional and higher dimensional worlds less significant - our upper dimensional universe would actually be just as interesting! Of course, there are also other reasons why

## Honest Game Design

To better depict what it means to design an honest game, we will start with the foundations of game design and then follow it up with the fundamentals of design science.

Let's start by considering the principles of game design that govern the way games are played for fun and entertainment purposes, and then give some detail about game science - the study and exploration of games from the perspectives of both their design and their gameplay.

Game Design
The first thing to note is that our focus of this book is not on the creation of games, but rather game design! So before we go on to the study of gameplay, let's first understand what it is that makes a game great and meaningful to players.

An Original Definition of Fun
To begin, let's take a closer look at an ancient definition of fun. It's a common sentence used in classical Chinese culture: "事不雜則樂,言不雜則知", which basically translates to "Everything is not too complicated it is fun and wisdom". The original meaning behind this sentence is this: it is a lot easier to find interesting things when you can ignore the big things around you.

Let's take a closer look at the ancient Chinese word "good complex structure" in a different context. In order to make everything work, a good complex structure will require an extremely well balanced set of elements such as the sound of the characters, the rhythm of the beat, and the rhythms of the music that makes up each and every beat. And just like good complex structures, games must also have a well balanced and diverse set of features, not to mention the great balance between entertainment value and technical ability!

And why can such a beautiful structure be created without a soundtrack?

Soundtrack
The soundtrack is an important part of any video game! Without a soundtrack, a game might just be dull and repetitive! Instead of simply looking at a game's image gallery, let's take a closer look at the sound that is created in video games. How can a game be more interesting than a movie with the soundtrack? How about something like video game soundtrack? In this case, we may be able to even consider the concept of a soundtrack as being essentially analogous to the concept of a movie in terms of how it captures certain feelings and emotions - the different voices portraying the same story line add to the overall feeling of the experience - not to mention whether or not the characters have distinct voices at each point (such as in a movie's voiceover for example)

An Original Definition of Fun
An even simpler way to understand the concept of fun is to consider the concept of a human. Humans possess a unique language called speech. The human brain can recognize and interpret different human behaviors in speech. And as long as the brain has access to a vocabulary that comprises both written and spoken words, then it is easy to figure out how to tell the story behind the words used. As a game's story is built up by combining all the words that are spoken in the game, then it is relatively easy for a player to identify the character who is performing the particular behavior - the actions of the characters are exactly what we would expect if they were actually performing the appropriate behaviors!

As a result of this ability, humans have been able to play games that have been created and developed specifically for the purpose of giving players an experience through which they can accurately identify the characters and voices of the voices they play (a concept called "voice mapping"). If you have the ability to play a game in which all the characters have distinct voices, then you would be able to accurately identify each of the characters as they perform the sounds they emit.

So what's wrong with using the voice of a character in a game? Well, there are two things wrong with this concept altogether:

The voice of the characters and even more specific actions are difficult to identify - the act of speaking to them or playing the game itself isn't easy for a player to be able to interpret properly. The lack of a soundtrack may not make a game any more interesting to players, simply because everything is hidden behind the screen!

A second aspect of this problem is how the voice of a character is typically used in the video game! The voice of the characters in a video game

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the different kinds of inferences that we can make in mathematics, many authors have created a class of terms called infj cognitive functions that they use in their descriptions of mathematical skills. Let's take a look at a few examples of each ability!

We all know that one of the best ways to explain scientific theories is to use graphs! It's not just that scientists use graphs to describe their findings accurately and succinctly; it makes sense to try and use them to gain insight into the mechanism behind science. Here's a couple of examples of these kinds of graphs:

What if we added a few extra points on our graph of power vs. voltage?

What if we added a few extra lines on our graph of power vs. voltage?

In both example graphs we can see that the points and lines represent different variables describing the relationship between two things.

What if we used a graph for this equation? We might think that this equation could be approximated, but we could in fact give it a better description by using graphs:

Let's try to see how much of a difference this might be compared to a graph:

This graph is much simpler than the previous one:

Let's take a closer look at what could be happening here.

We can easily see by looking at the graph that what we were thinking was happening in the beginning of the lesson is actually still happening today...

Now let's consider something a little more exciting! Imagine you were to learn algebra using the power of graphs! Yes, this sounds simple enough, but what about the difference this would make? Well if we want to better understand the way things work, it might help to start by comparing graphs and algebraic manipulations before we get into the more complicated stuff!

Let's take a look at some more graphs:

In the previous graph we can see that both variables are being represented by the line that connects the two points. This is what we call a straight line line. Let's consider this line a little bit further: it is basically just the vertical line that connects the two points at that location!

Now let's take a closer look at this line: we can see that the x and y axes represent the length and strength of this line; on the other hand, the z axis represents the angle - or as some people would say, the slope - of the line. Notice that this is a very straight line, even if it's curved around the z axis - it's a great advantage in this case and what will later come in handy when we get into the complexities of algebra.

Now what about this line? Let's look at it a bit more closely: it is curved around the z axis! Let's see how it looks like when it is turned 90 degrees to the x-axis.

So on the x-axis, the vector is pointing downwards now! This is where a deity would be! Let's take that particular straight line a little more in-depth and see what other interesting relationships might happen as we go along:

This line is a good example of how we can use straight lines to build up more complicated vector equations using only one set of variables!

Now let's take a closer look at this vector: as you can see, the vector lines out to different directions depending on whether we assume that we are moving in the up or down direction. We can now easily visualize that:

Next, let's see how the variables on this line relate to each other. This is the first thing that is going to come in handy when we get into more complex formulas:

Now let's take a closer look at this line: as you can see, it is completely curved around the z axis!

This is where the term we want to talk about comes in. Using this vector - along with some calculations - we can now give our vector equation a much more accurate description:

Notice that we've now added the x and y variables as well as the angle - or as we sometimes call it the "slope" - of the vector. This is actually what a deity would use to predict what will happen in the future once they know what's going on now.

Now we can make a couple more vector equations like this:

Using these equations, we can now easily make a few more equations:

And some more vector equations:

We can now see just how fast a deity or any human

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the nature of the INFP, here is a fun little game you can play.
First, start with 3 of your favourite colours.  You can assume different colours in different dimensions as well!
Now place your hand in a cup of water.  Think of the water as an energy field.  To the naked eye, the cup looks black as far as the eye can see.  However, at the bottom of the cup there is actually a light which is due to the fact that the water contains energy at all times.  This is called "energy field".  
What you need to do is look for patterns and similarities in the shape of the water you are putting into your cup.  For example, maybe you see that the water appears round at the top and then transitions to a triangle, with a sharp curve at the bottom.  And then, as it is moved down the length of the cup, it gradually becomes a long line.  There is a slight variation in the shape at the top and the bottom of the water as it's being moved down the cup however, but you know the water's going to have a similar shape.
Now when you're done, you simply remove the water from your cup, and look at your hand.  You will see that your finger is different in each direction.  This happens because the water's a field of energy that is changing constantly - so you look for patterns on this field to detect any changes you noticed in the water.   You can do this in any other dimension, but in 3 + 1 you must look for patterns in a black circle.  
Now your finger will become the body of the snake you are using - and you will then run across areas of space where your snake lives (in the 3+1 dimensional version, your snake should be a blue, pink, or red blob depending on the colour chosen).  A snake's life is really just a string of pixels that run to the end of the snake and then circle back around from the start.  You can use a mouse to look for this feature in any other dimension you like...like 4D if you're curious! :)

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of space and time with different dimensions as the main character tries to solve math problems, the main character uses the concept of mathematics as a way of thinking and communicating. This will be discussed in more detail in Chapter Thirty Seven.
The most obvious difference between Mathematics and Physics is that Mathematics only teaches us how to think about a problem by using a mathematical equation; Physics teaches us how to find the right mathematical equation for a given set of data. With this in mind it would make sense for Mathematics to explain mathematics in terms of physics; but since most humans are not well versed in mathematics, it's important for Physics to get some hands on education in the form of teaching Mathematics to our younger students.

Why does this matter? Well, imagine if Mathematicians taught Physics in any form...but as a result those Mathematicians wouldn't be able to teach us how to understand Mathematics either. Why would they want to do that? Well in order for such an educational process to work, it needs to be the most engaging and enjoyable learning experience possible for the learners. So it naturally favors Physics and the mathematical principles that it uses to teach Maths to those learners.

So what we're doing here in this chapter is introducing a bit more physics into our lesson plan - as we explain to our students that things such as Dimension travel are possible with the help of Physics. We'll begin with something simple, and then we'll extend it into bigger and bigger challenges as we go!

Let's say we are at our house (let's call it Home) and we wanted to build a house with a maximum floor area of 24 feet square! According to our math teacher, we only have to construct the house with a floor area of 12.3 ft². If you divide each foot square by a number (here 4.3) then it will give you an estimated floor area that would be needed to construct the house using these materials. Let's call this floor area estimate, AEst.

As you can see here, the house is going to be larger than we initially thought. Not only can the floor area of the house grow larger, but we also need to use more materials to build it. If we wanted to use a lot of wood to build the house we would have to make up for that by buying more stakes or something - but we don't want to do that now! That's why we have to be careful about selecting the right materials!

So we need to choose appropriate materials to construct the house - not so much material that will increase the house's width, but less material that will increase its height!
How can we know what kinds of materials are appropriate for constructing a house? As far as we know, there is no way to know how tall a house is, its width, or its height in terms of the different material types that can be used to construct it. What we know for sure though, is that our house will be larger than we originally thought!
As we continue in this way, the floor area will be getting bigger as time goes on - until we've made up for our initial selection of materials.

However, what if we didn't have the exact area we had initially selected for the house (or rather, our chosen material type)? Well, we can reduce our floor area estimate! By dividing each foot square by a smaller number, we can find the reduced floor area estimate, ARed.

As you can see here, the height of our house has been reduced significantly! Let's say we use stakes that would have been 3 ft. ² in height, but now that we have a reduced estimate of height, we can use only 5 ft. ²! Not only do we save a lot of materials, but also our house will be taller!

If the reduced area estimate, ARed, has been too low or too high, then we should make do with what we have! For instance, suppose we wanted to use stakes that would have 4 ft. ² in height as our height estimates, but when we reduced our height estimate ARed, we had to use only 2 ft. ²!
Let's say we wanted to use stakes that would have 4 ft. ² in height as our height estimate, but now that

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our understanding of mind and cognition, let's look at the following 3 questions:

Why is math so important to our lives?

Why do mathematicians write algebra and equations in the first place?

What mathematical models exist to explain complex processes?

As in previous chapters, we will begin this section by examining the first question! Mathematics has a much more robust connection to our lives than most would imagine!

The second question is actually quite broad! We should always keep in mind that we just do the math in order to understand the world. If we do not understand how to apply math, it will certainly make no sense - because it's more important that we understand that math is a fact of life than it is to understand how to do it.

The third question is really more important with our high school students than with us adults: Why is math so important to our lives?! Well, while I'm not sure if the answer is obvious to most of the adult population, it's worth considering it. We should all be a little more open-minded in our attitudes toward mathematics and math knowledge, as we have grown up in a society that strongly believes that everyone should be able to use math to solve everyday problems! But what really makes math so special is that it is one of only 3 things (besides physics and chemistry) that can be used in science, technology, and engineering - and, in my opinion, that's enough to show why we should be a little more interested in it.

How do mathematicians write algebra and equations?

The answer to this question is actually fairly vague. Although algebra is widely used in every discipline, and even more than that, most people are familiar with the mathematical properties of the exponential function. In terms of this answer, however, it doesn't matter whether we are dealing with ordinary equations or in complicated mathematics, the exponential function alone is enough to solve most problems in most contexts!

Is there a mathematical model to explain complex processes?

As we mentioned before, most of the math problems that we encounter deal with mathematical properties that are not easily captured by human intuition or language! One that I personally strongly believe exist is that of the Turing machine: a computational algorithm that can solve problems like finding a picture of a given object from a collection of related pictures! I strongly encourage all high school students to investigate this theory - as most math concepts don't come naturally to us. So much emphasis is placed on understanding our abilities during high school, whereas these theoretical ideas are really all that are taught us in undergraduate school!

So far so good. Let's explore what it means to be a mathematician and what kinds of problems we can use math to solve in high school and college...?

Chapter Thirty Seven
INTP Relationships with People Mathematics

First, let me just say that one might argue that mathematics is not a suitable topic for high school students - and I'm not quite convinced! Let's consider the following two questions:

Why do mathematicians write algebra and equations in the first place?

What mathematical models exist to explain complicated processes?

In most science courses, we'll learn that there are only two different types of scientists...algorithmist and logician: someone who analyzes and solves problems in an algorithmic fashion, while someone who deals with data logically! 

But why are mathematicians called algorithmic and logician?

I know that the word algorithm is sometimes used to describe an algorithm that is mathematically complicated and hard to understand, but there are only two different methods of doing math - and both are useful! Mathematicians use the terms algorithm and logic in general to describe the methods that are used for solving problems mathematically! The only thing that changes between logicians and algorithms is the fact that algorithms are always based on logic - as opposed to logic being a subtype of algorithm!

However, what about relationship between logician and algorithmist?

Some of the most powerful systems and theories of mathematics are developed by mathematically oriented experts like David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Vladimir M. Popov - and these people have built models and ideas from their own practical experience! In fact, they often base their theories and models on the reality they have observed in their scientific pursuits. This is why mathematicians use a combination of logic and mathematics for solving problems! Not only

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict my point, I will use a term called "isomorphic function". Suppose you have a concept called "book" and a concept called "map". In mathematics we can represent both books and maps in exactly the same way! For example, there could be exactly one line for each.
In physics we can represent book and map in different ways depending on what we are after! Let's consider two books. In one the maps represent the locations of things such as airplanes, trains, houses, etc., while in the other the maps represent the locations of the objects themselves - which, of course, may also be in relation to each other.
To illustrate this further, let's consider the following:

The line depicted by the yellow arrow is for a store, blue is for the location of the car, and green is for a house. The purple line is for a computer and the yellow line is for a bank!
Let's take a look at the "map" that is shown on the left, and imagine the position of the store, car, and banks. Now consider the "map" on the right showing the same information, but in relation to the position of the store and the location of the car. Do you see how different the map on the right would be? This example is from a book called "Reality" - to which we now become familiar!

We can explain this to ourselves by considering this analogy. When we see a store, we first think of the store in its real location - the store does not have to come in any other location. Once we see the store, then the thought of the location of things such as the car and the house simply comes into focus. Thus, in the first example we see the stores in their real locations - but in the second example the stores and cars and houses all come to mind - without necessarily having to think about what exactly they are! 

As you can see, the books shown on the right are not exactly the same as each other! I guess it must be this similarity that makes the two concepts isomorphic?

In addition to this similarity (which should not stop us doing the above analogy), let's note that books and maps are based on the same type of representation. A picture, for example, could represent a house more clearly than a page! You could say "the paper is more detailed". For every physical book, there is another book that corresponds to the same physical book and which has been "re-created" so as to be more detailed. You also know that every physical book and map has a physical body of paper with which it is based on. In the last example above, the physical book and map are the book and map corresponding to a physical store, as represented by the yellow pencil! This suggests that we should expect some sort of similarity between physical books and physical maps: each of them has a physical body that is based on the other, except for the fact that the physical book and map don't have the same physical body!

So what can we do to understand and predict the behavior of particles that travel across dimensions in some other way than just based on their geometric location? We can use the concept of "isomorphic function" to do this! Now imagine that we want to apply similar reasoning to a particle traveling through the dimensions of space-time. Consider the following simplified example that can be used to illustrate this concept. Let's consider an object that is completely wrapped in vacuum - or rather, like an ice cube! We can see this without actually seeing the object from the inside. The question is, how would this object travel between the dimensions of space and time?
Suppose this object did not experience any "acceleration" or "force" as it traveled through the dimensions of space-time (as it could only have experienced the energy of vacuum in the beginning and the gravitational field later, after having entered into dimension X). 
(Since we are assuming that this virtual object is completely wrapped in vacuum, everything about it will immediately return to the original vacuum that it came from.) 

This implies that it would be impossible (or very slow) to travel between dimensions! And this would mean, for example, that it would be impossible for our hypothetical virtual object to enter into an otherwise empty 4D space-time!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how we humans actually think - and how mathematical thinking can help us think - I've split this chapter into several sections. In the next section, I'll be introducing us to two fundamental kinds of thought - logical and abstract thought - and the ways in which they each contribute to different aspects of cognitive and behavioral functions.

In the next section, I'll be introducing us to some of the theories and concepts used to understand mathematical thinking and make that understandable to students and other members of the community, who may otherwise be ignorant of them. 

Section One: Logical Thinking Theory and Abstract Thinking: What Every Child Knew

Before we get into the real deal about logical and abstract thought, let's start off with some general math concepts.

Number and number systems

As a general rule, a number is either an integer (as an example - 7) or a real number (as an example - 2.44). An integer can only be written in base 10 (e.g. 7 can be written as 2.44), but it can also be written as any combination of base 10 numbers (e.g. 2.44 can be written as 2.44, 2.5, 4, 8, etc.). Real numbers can only be written as whole numbers - e.g. 1.00 (as opposed to the decimal notation 1.00 for 2.00).

There are a number of ways we can express a number using the basic concepts that we learned above - in other words there are many different types of numbers. This is one of the main reasons why most people associate numbers with certain activities such as science and math. For example, when we speak and write quantities such as inches, a given length of room must be measured, so we can determine the size of the room and figure out how to measure the width of the room and how long it had been before we moved in. Also, the length of time taken to drive 40 miles into a certain direction is denoted by the number 40 miles, which is expressed in terms of miles (40 miles = 40,000 feet) and can be read both ways (40 miles = 1,000,000 feet). Also, we can make use of these notions by writing things down on charts such as: 20 degrees north and 40 degrees west on a map and drawing the map so that we can easily visualize the direction and location of the point. We also often visualize numbers in terms of color - e.g. an "8" is a red color, while a ten is a blue color. When we speak about colors, we are often using one of the three primary colors, either red (e.g. red carpet), blue (e.g. blue sky) or green (e.g. green grass) - this is because these colors are usually associated with places or events that are both warm and blue and so have a strong association with events that are both hot and green.

As is often the case in these examples, it is important to note that the meaning of a word or definition can be quite different in different contexts. By using the rules and concepts that we learned above, we can simplify the use of the word 'number' and 'number' as a concept - this way, we can gain a clearer sense of how we use the word and how it is used. For example, we can distinguish between the word 'number' and 'number symbol'. The former refers to a number that happens to occupy a particular place at a specific moment, while the latter refers to a symbol that is used to represent a number. This distinction makes it easier for people to understand what the words actually mean and, thus, allows users to communicate more effectively.

Theory of Number Systems

Number systems - which is also known as numbering systems - are systems of notation for numbers. The term 'number system' was coined by Plato in the 4th century BC. Number systems are systems of notation that allow us to represent numbers in a simple and easily understood manner. Number systems have numerous purposes - for example, when we are learning the concept of the number line and the number line as a graph we are able to visualize the structure of the number line, which allows us to follow the number

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way mathematics works, let's take a look at some examples of basic problems related to mathematical concepts. Some problems take on different forms depending on their subject matter and the context of their solution.

We learned about the concepts of integer numbers over the years, including the definition and basic properties of integer numbers. As shown above, the concept of an integer number can be divided into two basic parts: integer part and fractional part.

Next, we learned about real numbers, including the definition and basic properties of real numbers. Again, the concept of real numbers can be divided into two basic parts: real part and absolute value of real part.

Then we learned about trigonometry, including the definition and basic properties of sines and cosines. Since sin and cos only deal with angles, the two basic types of trigonometric functions will not be discussed at all.

Finally, we learned about algebraic geometry, including the definition and basic properties of lines, planes, and hypotenuses. In essence, algebraic geometry has nothing to do with real numbers or angles and everything to do with numbers, shapes, and lines.

Based on this lecture, it should be relatively easy to make sense of these three concepts, although let's not get ahead of ourselves - we'll try to keep these examples brief and to the point...


Now lets consider a few more basic concepts related to mathematics.

So, finally, we would like to see how some simple mathematical concepts, such as triangle inequality, can help us solve problems related to real numbers and angle.

Now on the other hand, most of us know about the concept of inequality and its properties - such as the triangle inequality. However, as we've seen above, there are some concepts that, unless clearly defined, are just mathematically vague concepts. So let's make a brief attempt to summarize some basic geometric/mathematical concepts that make sense in a short period of time!


So let's take a look at the example from Chapter 35:

Given an area, find a right angle. The solution gives us an area equal to one, or exactly 12 inches squared. If you were to add up these square inches and subtract them from one, you would get an answer equal to one - 12/8 = one! You can certainly see that this operation is mathematically correct because these squares are all equally important to the sum and the difference of the whole.

As a reminder, you can also use this equation as the equivalent of finding any value in between one and zero using the integer division algorithm.


A:

There are some nice ideas there, including the use of dimension in understanding how time and space are affected. But in general all of the solutions seem a little bit silly. It is not like the idea behind the question was "how to tell a line from a circle". This question is about how to tell the boundaries of an object's motions in 3D space.
But if you are actually looking for a good (and easy to understand) way of finding a boundary between an object that is moving forward and one that is moving backward, which is a fundamental question in relativity, you can always look at the example of this question.
If you think about it, the answer to that question should be pretty simple. If you are moving with a speed of 10 meters per second, the first point the object touches is a stationary point and the second point is a moving point. In addition, as the object travels through space, the points touch each other more and more. So there must be a boundary between the two. But we just made an incredibly complex model of it and it is very hard to grasp the concept of such simple boundaries. So why can't we make it simple enough?
In my class we are talking about the time-energy of a gravitational field and the time-energy of a particle. The time-energy of a gravitational field basically tells us what the field would be like if it had no momentum. In other words, the energy density of this gravitational field at a particular point in space would be the same.
If the energy density is constant, then at the point where the trajectory of the particle meets the trajectory of the gravitational field there is no change in time-energy. If the energy density is not constant you could get the same answer by assuming that

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematical concepts work inside a typical computer, we can start by considering a simple computer game with only a single instruction: take the square root. Here is what it looks like in playback:

In just four lines of text, we can see that each instruction is used to describe the behavior of the computer as we play the game - it takes four lines to describe the behavior of taking the square root. Each line consists of one or more letters that describe the command as well as some extra text on top to help us understand the whole story:
• Take This Square Root
• A square root
• A Square Root
• A Square Root.
Obviously this is just an example - not every game will follow along the same lines of text. However, in a very large scale environment, we can see that when we think of these commands, we can picture each of these four words being used separately for describing what is happening to the computer.

Now in a larger scale environment, we can see that the computer can perform several actions using these four commands. This includes executing each of the simple logic functions mentioned previously. For example, take the square root requires a computation, and our four-letter word for the computation is the following instruction:

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the fate of these four men, and one other being, depends on them deciding whether to accept a invitation from the other three! There are several reasons for this - all of which are described below:

Many of the other three spirits don't like having to travel with the rest of the visitors. This is because many of them fear the constant presence of spirits in their space-time, which would make it more difficult for them to carry out certain duties and functions that would be necessary for their mission.
Another reason for the three spirits being rather skeptical of the invitations given to them is that many of them have been traveling around the world in search of other beings to find out what made humans develop such an interesting sense of purpose and understanding!
In addition, the spirits didn't actually choose to give these invitations (not even to the others!); they just happened to be the most popular and wanted to take part in the celebration!

A final reason is that the two spirits who received the invitation were not exactly ideal companions for the other spirits to travel with at the moment! This is because the people who received these invitations were all on the verge of becoming extremely ill, having experienced severe injuries or illnesses that would have been unforgettable for other people to see - the death of a loved one, for example!
So having to travel with the spirits who were both in such dire straights would have been a recipe for problems.

Well this does sound like a pretty bad set of circumstances for them to be in...what do you know, maybe they survived the event and the others died of a similar illness? Or did they get into worse misfortunes before finding out about these invitations?
The group makes their way through the main portal in the cave, until they encounter a statue of the Great Spirit of Time and Place!
We now head back towards the temple, where one of the spirits tells them to leave the group and not to come back before meeting the Great Spirit, who then shows them the way back to the cave!

So once again, we have found ourselves in the very heart of The Ancient City!

If we look down the road, we will see several doors leading into various buildings. These are actually quite important locations in their respective domains. The Great Spirit's Tower is important because it serves as a central location for all of The Ancient City, including the city itself! The Great Spirit's Tower is known as the "Grand Council" and is the highest location in The Ancient City!

One of the towers of The Great Spirit's Tower is set atop a large and beautifully carved throne. The Great Spirit's Tower does not actually have an entrance directly connected to its interior in order to avoid any kind of disturbance - but it does have a large stone gate to the inside!

The Great Spirit's Tower is a beautiful, large, and large room that fits over two thirds of the size of this entire building! It is built out in a grand circle of stone, set back against the surrounding mountains. Here the Great Spirit would usually spend his time, teaching the other spirits what he has learned from his journey to the other side...and he will have none but the best of intentions towards his students, despite the fact that they might not be 100% happy about the invitations they received! His room is decorated with rich and beautiful paintings, as well as with beautiful statues and other items that illustrate his travels...

After the final of the three invitations have been given, the Great Spirit brings the group back to The Ancient City's main entrance. However, this does have a big problem, all of which has to do with the fact that many of the people present in the city were in fact dead! Just as the Great Spirit is teaching his students, the Holy Ghost who was present to start out the group is also killed by the spirits!

The group members are now sitting around by various empty coffins, where there is no sign that they are taking any comfort from the dead spirits left behind! The Great Spirit looks down at them, smiling in pain, and takes a deep breath and then gives them this message:

Now you know what it took your friends to give you, and you will all have to take it from them.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the idea of marriage, let us imagine the scenario depicted in the last chapter - a man and a woman arrive at a beautiful mansion, wait anxiously for the guests to arrive, then head to their room prepared to wait for them...


As we just illustrated, marriage can be described in some meaningful terms using mathematics. First of all, if we define the word "relationship" as involving three persons, then we have three types of relationships that can exist between a man and a woman: 1) The wedding relationship; 2) The spousal relationship; and 3) The conjugal relationship.

In traditional western society, we would expect the most important part of a person's life to be their marriage. What if we were to ask the woman if she would like to marry the man? Given that her answer is yes, then the relationship would be the marriage relationship. However, in modern society, marriage can sometimes be described only in terms of "fun", rather than in terms of actual love.
As an example, let's say we had a man and a woman who were both going to attend the wedding of the same person. The man did not get to know the woman until the day before the wedding! Given that the man and the woman knew what was going to happen, this would not be a relationship; this would be a "waiting" relationship for them.

Now we can start to create a mathematical concept for this marriage waiting relationship! Imagine a person who is about to marry another person. We will call this person "Luke". He has a wife named "Helen" in his lifetime that he lives with and with whom he has two children - a cute baby boy named "Bug" and a little girl named "Sally". We will call the woman his "personal" wife. The person does not know his "personal" wife until the day of his wedding.
Now imagine that the man and the woman were both going to do the same thing - they spent the day in the mansion with each other while waiting for their wedding. As you guessed, this marriage relationship would not be any more than just "waiting". If each side of the relationship gets along and understands each other's point of view, then it would be a more positive relationship even though it is still called a "twelve-step relationship."

Now let us extend this concept one step further into something called the marriage relationship. Assume that the man and the woman know exactly what they are going to do during their wedding ceremony. Therefore, the "marriage" relationship is not only a relationship but also involves the two parties being committed to each other permanently after their wedding - they are getting married while still doing the same thing.
Now let's imagine that both the person and the spousal relationship would be created with the help of a "stepping stone". A "stepping stone" is a contract that the couple signs to represent their relationship even though the relationship may not have yet been concretized in any physical way. In the typical case, a "bind-off" is an official document in which the couple signs a contract to be married. In the marriage relationship, however, the "stepping stones" would be other official documents.
What if we were to look at the three types of relationships described above and divide them up again into three categories? Now our relationship would be described by the following:

The wedding relationship, also known as the "golden one".

The spousal relationship or the "golden half".

The conjugal relationship or the "golden half"...

Let's focus on the gold-standard of "married life" - the conjugal relationship. This relationship is also known as the "man in the mirror" or the "fellatio" relationship, which is a relationship between two people who have fallen in love.

In this case, the man can show himself to a perfect woman in the mirror - that's the gold standard of the "man in the mirror" relationship. Since this relationship is created with the help of a "stepping stone", it's also known as an "Aufwärts-Stehen" relationship.

So, now let's look at the two most common ways of creating "stepping stones" - marriage

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the unique nature of the ancient Maya religion, we will first explore their ancient traditions about rituals. We will also examine the most popular and well-known ceremonies from this ancient culture.

Maya Rituals

As we have seen in chapter 30, rituals are an important form of religion. Because they are essentially used to control, guide and honor the gods, rites are central to all Maya lives. These rituals, whether performed by the individual or a group of people, typically involve the sacrifice of one or more animals to a spirit figure or the act of taking a new name. As we will argue in the following chapter, the ritual and sacrifice of an animal play a particularly important role in the Maya religion because it allows the person performing the ritual to communicate with the animal.

From the perspective of a modern person, the sacrificing of an animal might seem a bizarre occurrence. And it's true - just like most modern rituals, sacrificing animals was a big deal during the Maya religion, and it is still a part of the ritual. However, in the Maya traditional view, to sacrifice an animal implies two things which are extremely important to the Maya:

Our bodies are made of blood that can be used to cure diseases and as an agent for cleansing. On this spiritual level, slaughter of animals is an inevitable part of a person's spiritual purification and personal health. In fact, this is so fundamental to the Maya religion that it is one of several spiritual practices that has been called the sacred slaughter of animals;

Animals are used as intermediaries in the spiritual realm as their death is essential in passing on their memories and experience. Even at the height of the Maya culture, the sacrificing of animals still continued to be something that was a part of people’s everyday lives.

So when someone becomes sick or passes away, how could the people of the past help the deceased to take better care of them? The practice of sacrificing large animals - such as bullocks, goats and pigs - was part of this "health" practice.

When a person experiences a sickness or disease, this part of the Maya religion offered their special blessings to the person who is suffering - specifically by offering prayers to spirit figures from the spirits who would then guide them to cure this sickness (or disease). As the person becomes more and more ill, more and more animals they wish would receive the blessing would be sacrificed - and the most important part of the sacrifice is to offer the animal to a spirit figure. Here is where our favorite example of the sacrificing of an animal enters into play.

From the perspective of an animal - specifically a goat - it is one of the best gifts given to the spirit figure. The goat will give itself to the spirit figure at the right time without any effort as it follows the direction of the donkey. This is important because the goat is not able to make any direct movements - it just follows the donkey's direction - this is how it will be able to carry on the sacrifice while staying faithful to its donkey.

If you are unable to get a goat, however, you can still make a sacrificial offering to a spirit figure by throwing a goat's head in place of the donkey's head. This is one of the most iconic rites of the ceremony, and usually happens during the morning or evening before the first sun rises. The goat’s head is thrown into the surrounding area; the sun will light up the goat's head to give it the special blessing that the head of the donkey would give to the person trying to make his/her own sacrifice.

From the perspective of the person trying to make an offering:

If the offerings have been successful, you will be rewarded with the gift of a new name. Now the name you take on your new birth isn't one that you chose...it is the name that the person with whom you are celebrating your birth wanted - a way to honor the life they lived.

For those who cannot make this sacrifice, the Maya tradition states that their spirit would still be guided by the spirits behind the animal who was sacrificed.

From the perspective of the people who sacrificed:

The spirit figure is a very important part of the ceremony. It is important to understand

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the effects of deity dimension travel, let's imagine a little experiment. Take a bunch of apples and split them up into smaller pieces - let's call them slices. Take a bunch of slices of apples and place them on a plate. In a simple geometric sense, each of the slices of apples is contained within a sphere. When you slice each apple into smaller pieces, the slices are now contained within a smaller sphere, each with its own point defining its location! To better understand how apples are represented in this simple geometric analogy, let's take a closer look at the 3D geometry. Let's call these 5 slices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5! As you can see, the spheres all fit perfectly inside the apples' actual shape, each covering half of the slice! What happens when we take a second look at the 5 slices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5? Well first, they are all contained within the spheres' actual shape, but instead of being contained all on one side, they are now all on both sides of the sphere! The reason behind this is that when we look at each half of each of the 5 slices we see 2, 3, 4, and 5 sitting on a line - they are both on this line! When we look at them both separately from each other, they look almost identical - the slight difference only comes about due to one tiny part of the sphere. Now if we take a closer look at each of the slices, we can see that the slice 1 is on the line that intersects each of the other 4 slices, while the slices 4 and 5 are not. And in a simple geometric sense, those 2 remaining slices are both on the opposite side of the line that intersects each other! This means that the 4 slices contain the one slice in which we placed the original slices.
Now imagine a little ball on a smooth surface! The surface on which this little ball is laying is a smooth planar surface called a surface of revolution. Let's call the points defining the position of this little ball at different times (t) "sections of the sphere." Let's imagine we were to take two different sections of the sphere together - let's call these sections S0 and S1. As time passes S0 and S1 come together! Each of the sections therefore become slightly longer than their original length, but in the opposite direction! This effect is named "time stretching". Now if we take S0 and S1 together on top of each other and then flip each section 180 degrees so that the new sections are on both sides of the previous ones then we end up with two sections on either side of the first section and the top of the second section. Now imagine that we are sitting in a room, and we take S0 and S1 together and then turn around! This means that we have created an extra section between S2 and S3 so as a result, we now have a total of 4 sections that we can now place on either side of the original section. Now imagine that we take all of these sections together and keep them together for many years! At each time it takes between 4 to 5 life cycles for these sections of the sphere to pass through each other! Each time the whole system passes through another section, we end up with a new section of the sphere that is also contained inside each of the original sections! So each time it takes 4 to 5 life cycles for the system to pass through another section of the sphere, we end up with 2 sections that are simultaneously contained in each of the original sections. As each of these 4 sections pass through other sections at various times, this results in what we call a "pyramid" of sections. As each new section is created, each pyramid will start to climb up until it reaches the top. As you can see, this pyramid is actually just a kind of "sheet of paper" of different sections! When we take a closer look at the "pyramid," we can now see that it represents an ordered arrangement of "tops" of the original sections. What does this mean? Well it means that the original sections all share some common structure, but they don't share the exact same structure. For example, the first section has two tops; the second and the third

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the Universe has to be governed by a Divine Being - but as a small group of mortals, that being doesn't rule it. Instead, he is limited in his power by our imperfect nature - his energy and creativity. If we just get around to living according to his dictates, his ability to do things will only become more limited as our actions become more common.

The first thing to note is that humans have had a major impact on the world around as a result of their creativity. This creativity is the power behind the birth of science as it has created many incredible discoveries - things we cannot imagine even now! The best example is Einstein's theory of relativity, which came about directly from our creative ability!

But as a group of mortals, we are a little different from other human races - our energy is generally concentrated in three major areas of our bodies: brain, stomach, and lungs. In other words, we are like our pets are - they would be happier without their pet food or a bath. So instead, we devote far too much of our energy to creating new foods, living longer, and keeping our bodies in working condition.

This doesn't necessarily mean that we don't have power over ourselves - the universe created us, just like the universe created animals - we have free will - that means we are able to create ourselves according to what is best for us at any given moment. The biggest barrier to our creativity is probably our own nature - the way we think and how we behave. Most of the time we focus on things we don't need to worry about - things we can manipulate through our own will. For example, we tend to think that changing our diet is the most important aspect of our well-being, instead of looking at the health benefits of eating organic produce and other foods that are high in healthy fats and vitamins. These types of actions cause us to create more energy and focus on things that can be manipulated through our own will.

As we become more and more intelligent, our energy is increasingly concentrated in the areas of our bodies that allow us to create new items. Since our minds aren't limited by our physical bodies or by our environment, we create more and more creative items. Over time, this creates a pattern of ideas in our minds - we start to believe and have an idea for almost everything. There is nothing that stops us from doing this - it is just more difficult!

Of course, this is simply an exaggeration of how creative humans can be. But if we can see how creative humans are, we can create even more items and believe in more stuff (like God and the universe itself) by focusing on those things where we have unlimited control and energy. We should take note that a small group of the world's best inventors only invented 10% of all new inventions. The rest of us simply created items that can improve living conditions in this day and age - we can take these items and create items that solve the problems that need to be solved!

The most important thing to note is that most of these items are only created through the ideas that exist in our minds. So while some inventions are created through our actions on the everyday basis, the vast majority of these inventions are created through the power inside our minds at least until they become more advanced. In other words, their creators' original ideas are only as powerful as their own intelligence!

Of course, even the idea that our minds can create items of our own is only a myth - it just might as well not exist at all. For example, God created the universe through his mind, but nothing came out of his mouth! This is a very common myth amongst people in the world, but it is not true!

As we create items on the everyday basis, we create more and more magical ideas - the ones where we believe that something else can be created instead of us. Most of our items are made up of only half of our original ideas - half on the everyday basis and half in our imagination. Over time, this creatively stimulates our brains so that we become more creative. These items become more powerful and more likely to bring about our own deaths - this is the main reason that the creation of immortality is possible only through the creation

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the word "dude" is really oddly constructed - the word means "funny" in common English, a term often applied to people who are eccentric, or odd. However, there are some cases in which the word means "perfection"; for example, it's in the dictionary definition of "perfect" to say "I'll give you a perfect show"...

Well, at least for its original meaning, the word "dude" has been meaningless for more than a century. In fact, it actually has been used to insult someone in our native tongue, by the early 16th century. Originally, the word came from a Latin word meaning "perfection". However, when it first spread to English, it was used to describe someone who was very good at making fun of you, even if you didn't know him or she by name. In a nutshell: the word can be very useful for insulting someone - but it's not very good at describing someone in other circumstances. So, why do we use the word "dude" at all?

Well, it was because it helped people laugh at the odd, eccentric or wild behavior or personality of someone. This is probably why idioms like "The guy who always wants to go to the spa is a dude!" come up in conversation about someone who is "funny" to people. It was so common that people had even invented a word to describe this same behavior – "geist"!

Now let's say the person making fun of us ends up killing us (and we don't want to know who or what killed him; we just want to know what drove the person to act this way). In this situation, it's pretty well understood that the death would either have been an accident, or would have been caused by an unusually bad drug - basically, whatever drove them to act this way! However, there is a more complicated issue! As the author of "Easy Money," Jack London explains, not only is the act of dying irritating, but people also know that those who kill themselves often end up dead of something even worse than alcohol poisoning (e.g. a deadly insect bite, etc.). These people don't want anyone to know their secret...so that's why they start acting like idiots when they die!

Now back to our hypothetical hypothetical example. Let us assume that our 4D deity enters into Dimension X, right before we have any idea that it has actually moved into a 3D universe. In fact, since he is so far from us, he would be able to see us coming at the time of the death, but as we approach the deity his eyes would become darker and darker, and his eyelashes would curl up, like in some kind of a spider's web. So, our hypothetical deity would die of a substance called "Fucked" Drugs, which are compounds that are specifically formulated to have a very strange effect on people who die of things without having any type of obvious cause. Of course, the Fucking Drugs wouldn't kill our hypothetical deity, but we aren't sure if the person who used them actually died of something without clear cause. Moreover, if our hypothetical deity dies of a deadly substance, is the actual substance that killed him, or is someone making fun of him and then punching him in the head with a rock?

At the end of the day, the truth is that we aren't sure whether the substance that killed our hypothetical deity actually was a toxic substance, or someone made fun of him and punched him in the head...it could very well be the same substance that killed someone else! The same could be said about someone who died of a "genius" drug, or even more bizarre stuff...the idea is that we aren't sure at all! If anything, some things we believe are true - such as the unbelievable speed with which something turns into light - are based on speculation! But, again, we're not sure how the people who make up these theories actually died! Or even if they died of something that was not a drug; the theory might be that those people thought that whatever they were experiencing, was so "up there", and so they just happened to happen upon it at

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict which dimension the Sargon of Akkad's demon called the Serpent is travelling in, let's take as our example two-dimensional space-time, rather than space alone.

Let's take as an example the Sargon of Akkad's demon called the Serpent. Remember that the Sargon of Akkad's demon is a two dimensional entity, as opposed to five-dimensional space-time. In order to understand how the Sargon of Akkad's demon would travel between dimensions, let's review what the rules are for five-dimensional spaces, as opposed to dimensionally reduced two-dimensional (or lower dimensional) spaces.

So the rules for five-dimensional spacetime are twofold - on the one hand, if two of three variables (x, y, z) change at once (as opposed to, say, y, x changing at once), then there will be an external factor that accelerates the velocity of the two objects involved in the change (for some reason). However, at the same time that the object is moving, the velocity of the other two variables does not change (so, y does not change either), and that's the same argument that applied to the change of x, y, z! So at the same time it is accelerating, it is not accelerating, it is decelerating, the change in its velocity does not change, but its acceleration does change! 

Now the Sargon of Akkad's demon is moving between dimensions in a three-dimensional universe, but it's being acted upon by something called curvature. For this reason, if one changes the velocity of one of the variables at a time, the velocity of the other variables is the same as before. However, if the changes of the variables' velocities happened simultaneously, then the Sargon's demon would experience curvature as that change happened - and so when the Sargon's demon changes its velocity, so does its acceleration - it still remains accelerating - but at the same time it is being acted upon by curvature, so its velocity is the same - this would explain why the Sargon's demon travels faster in Dimension Y than in Dimension X! On the other hand, the Sargon of Akkad's demon will only enter dimension Y if it's at velocity zero - the Sargon's demon can't take any more velocity, it's too fast! So the Sargon's demon will only enter Dimension Y when it is at rest!

The Sargon of Akkad's demon enters Dimension Y because there is so little change between dimensions - the Sargon's demon is travelling at an average speed across its four axes: zero, one, two, three times the speed of light (which is approximately 20,000km/s). Let's say the Sargon's demon moves to dimension X at one thousand speed of light per second, so it's travelling at around 20,000 km/s/minute, and entering dimension Y at four million speed of light per second, this would leave the Sargon's demon travelling at one million speed of light per second across the four axes: zero, one, two, three times the speed of light - it would then be travelling at exactly the speed of light! It's going to enter Dimension Y, and in this case - it's running at 20,000m/s - the Sargon's demon would experience a change in its acceleration, and it would then pass through dimension Y without being noticed by us!

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the above discussion, I will make use of the following simple diagram:

In this diagram I would like to show two points of interest, the two edges, where the arrow indicates movement in an undefined direction. So imagine I enter the first edge labeled A, then the second labeled B.
At any point during my (imaginary) movement through the diagram, the "functional programming" rule should be the driving factor here. Let's see if this is true for our particle:

As long as our particle is moving within our 3+1 dimensional universe, these two functional programming rules are the only two that apply. Since they are the only two, there is going to be no "extra" directions between them! (If there are, it would only be two!)

So we have proved the validity of the "functional programming rule" for all dimensions. If we were to take a slice through the diagram at any given time, we would see that the two functions represented our particle's motion:
At time 't' we have:

where 'a' represents the velocity of the particle while 'B' represents the velocity of our plane at time 't'. 

However, we know that we can only move either A or B - they are both the functions describing our particle's motion. Let us take an example of one such function - 'B':

Let's assume we want our particle to enter Dimension X immediately. However, there are two reasons our particle doesn't get into Dimension X:

Our plane is moving faster than the particle, which causes it to enter Dimension X sooner.

And our plane is moving slower than the particle, which causes it to enter Dimension X later.

Based on our 3+1 dimensional universe, this would be impossible because that plane is going to encounter a force that we are unable to control due to the properties of our universe, so it can't enter Dimension X at all. However, our plane is only moving at a rate of 2.87^(-4) x/s. So imagine the velocity of the plane is 1, and our plane is moving at a speed similar to a car driving in the air at about 500 miles per hour. This would cause the velocity of the plane to exceed the speed of the particle, so our plane would hit the particle instead. This would cause our plane to lose momentum and thus become stationary - which would not be the outcome that we want! 

In conclusion, from this simple example we see the following:

Our plane only gets within the Dimension X when it is moving at a speed faster than this, which means our plane is only moving at a speed greater than 2.87^-4 m/s = ~3.87 x/s. 

So when we take a slice through the diagram, we find that when our particle is moving faster than our plane, then our plane can only enter Dimension X when it is moving at a speed that is greater than 3.87^-5 m/s = ~5.87 x/s. 

On the other hand, when our plane is moving slower than the particle, then our plane can only enter Dimension X when it is moving at a speed greater than 3.87^-4 m/s = ~3.87 x/s. In other words, when our plane goes outside the Dimension X, there must be a force at work that is greater than both of the above forces!

It is interesting that the above rules apply, given that we only use two functional programming rules to describe the movement of our particle. In other words, we are able to explain our particle's behavior even without making any assumptions about the nature of the forces that govern the behavior of objects in 4D spacetime!

In a separate chapter, we'll have more detailed information about deities and the functional programming rule.

Now if you want to delve deeper into the functional programming rules, I offer these links to some of the books I've used a ton to get me started! I recommend a good book on functional programming to anyone interested on what it's like to study mathematical logic and the theory behind functional programming principles.

Let's assume the dimension of the "world" of particle's is greater than (let's say, 1). The "current" time of the particle is specified by

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the concept of time dilation in physics, let us examine the story of Peter Pan in Peter Pan and the Ghostly Child! Peter Pan was a boy traveling through space-time at the age of 4, but his parents thought he was an adult because he traveled in time. Peter Pan was a magical boy who could travel at warp speed from one dimension to another! He traveled in Time (from 3 to 4) and Space (from 3 to 4) and was eventually transported back to his own dimension, but the time it took Peter Pan is quite long compared with what it would take him to travel between different dimensions!

In this chapter, we will explore how we use the concept of time dilation to understand how time behaves in physics, and also how time dilation can affect what we can and cannot do in the future!

The first thing to note is that time is only defined relative to objects at rest - for example, clocks do not have a single position at rest! Time is actually an "imaginary place - a fictional place," where events in the past can still have an effect on events in the future. As such, it's important to distinguish real time from imaginary or fictional time. Let's define the real time simply as "the time of the universe currently in the present," whereas imaginary time is the time in which an event could occur or an object can enter into existence. The idea here is that an event will remain a real event even if the object or event involved has already passed through other real dimensions! This would make sense if an entity were to pass through another dimension and arrive at the real dimension where it's supposed to be, or if an entity were to travel through the infinite dimensions and arrive back in some point in the infinite past!

So Peter Pan would know what imaginary time looks like as a result of his long journey through Time. Let's say he traveled from 3 through 4 to arrive at 4-Dimensional reality. Then let us define the imaginary time during this voyage as:

... the time when an event could possibly occur between 3 and 4!

Now imagining that Peter Pan travels back to 4-Dimensional reality, and as we previously defined he goes in imaginary time (meaning that every part of his trip has already occurred in imaginary time), we would have something like this:

So as we know, time is a fictional place where events that are not already occurring are still considered possible. This implies that for a real entity such as Peter Pan, his journey back to 4-Dimensional reality would be like a journey into imaginary time.

Now let's examine what happens in imaginary time! We know that imaginary time is not just one discrete place, but rather a continuum of places that will change over time - in our example above, if Peter Pan traverses from 3 space dimensions to 4 space dimensions, he will likely experience multiple transitions from one place to another. The transition might be from dimension to dimension, or from point to point. However, this would be different from other types of transitions that we know of in real time.

Now let's examine another example! Suppose that we have a set of identical clocks. Let's take an identical clock that has exactly the same date on each side of its dial - just like any regular clock!

Imagine that you look at this clock and the first thing you notice is that the date on the side of the dial is the same as the date on the other side of the dial! Of course, you see this because of the identical dates that each clock experiences - but it's true that these identical dates occur in different locations at the different times in the real time. Now imagine that you take a slice from one of the clocks, cut it open, and see the clock's date on one side turn into a solid - as far out on the date chart as the date is represented! Now imagine that you cut off the slice (and place it back in the original clock) and you open up the clock again! You notice how the clock has a very different date - which has occurred over and above the slice's date - because this is a solid slice - there's no way to change the date on either side of the solid slice without changing the location within the clock!

Now let's move on to the

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the way the Meadow Mage interacts with the elements, we need to first explain the term Mage. Essentially, a mage is someone who has the ability to create magical artifacts from all things that are outside of traditional nature. For the purposes of this discussion, we'll primarily want to focus on Magic artifacts that have the ability to transport between dimensions. For more on this, see section 1 of the previous chapter!

So as far back as time, there are numerous people who have taken up the role of magician, though a lot of them have been relatively uncommon, since much of the history of magic has involved the creation of powerful spells. This is where we see the Meadow Mage - a woman who has been named by the myth of the Twelve Apocalypse to keep an eye out for anything that seems magical and strange, and to use her ability to summon creatures from all over the world who may help her maintain her magic powers.
First off, what exactly is a mage? A mage is someone who specializes in using magic to manipulate or transform things that exist in a different dimensional space-time to suit their own purposes. Essentially, a mage uses her powers to create magical artifacts by pulling from the elements or from natural sources to produce physical effects instead of using spells. Because we have talked about the relationship of elements to one another, we can then explain the relationship between magicians and other creatures that exist within the various elements.

From this information we can say that some of the most powerful magicians in history were Earth Mages (who lived in the Earth dimension and who were famous for creating weapons and armors, as well as weapons for the Earth Dimension which would later evolve into War Magicians). These Earth Mages were famous for the creation of magical artifacts which could be used to create weapons or armor or to craft weapons from natural sources. One of their most well-known artifacts was the Great Smoke of War: a weapon that would be used to battle against other mages!

And then there's the Earth Mage called the Eye of the Dragon: the ability to sense the energy generated by magic is a very powerful ability that would allow an Eye of the Dragon to access any dimensional or higher level of ability.

But what about the mages that use the energy of dragons to create magical artifacts? Well let's find out! Let's take a look at how dragon creatures are able to create magical artifacts that can travel between different dimensions.

Let's start with dragons. Drakes are large dragon-like animals that live in different realms of the world - they can be found in the Earth and Fire Dimension as well as the Sky Dimension. Generally speaking, dragon creatures don't have the physical ability to create anything without having some sort of magic energy present. But there is something called the Dragon Fire that can only be produced by an eye with magical power: The ability to see the energy from the Dragon Fire.

So what happens if you're trying to pull stuff from the Dragon? Well according to standard New Age concepts as well as mythology, the Dragon Fire would seem to be the source of magic. It would seem to be the sole source that allows dragons to create magical artifacts. However, dragons don't have magical powers. Instead, dragon dragons use their eyes (or, magically speaking, their eyes) to see the energy from the Dragon Fire:

As we understand, dragon eyes do have magical powers, so why wouldn't dragons be able to create magic artifacts from the Dragon Fire?

This is where we come into the first of several lessons in the mists of the Twelve Apocalypse - in this chapter we will explore the way the Twelve Apocalypse created mages to protect themselves. 

Let's break down the theory a bit more: The Twelve Apocalypse are a series of events that took place around the beginning of the world. In the end, the Twelve Apocalypse ended with the Apocalypse in Exile - many of the mages in the world have since vanished, but there is still the knowledge of the Twelve Apocalypse and its mages in the Great Book of Mages where this knowledge is kept. The Great Book of Mages is a collection of mages' writings containing the teachings of their ancestors.

One of the most important aspects of the Twelve Ap

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the answers to all of the mysteries surrounding the 4D Universe cannot be found in conventional physics. In fact, it is possible that none of the 4D mysteries can remain unexplained in the future. But that's not really what I'm talking about!

What's interesting, however, is that deities in all of existence can apparently travel freely between different dimensions in the 4D Universe without experiencing any restrictions whatsoever - including those that appear to be imposed on 3+1 dimensional worlds' inhabitants. How do these figures get into different dimensions, then?

In this chapter, we will first understand how these deities travel through Dimension X at different speeds, and use this knowledge to formulate a proposition that disproves the existence of 4D Universe.

As we discussed in Chapter Twenty, deities can appear in different dimensions in all 4D Universes (assuming space-time is one of them, and all 4D universes are connected) - they exist in 4D spaces that are entirely unlike our own 3D Universes. Thus we will begin learning about the different dimensions that deities inhabit

Now let's say the 4D deity begins moving in the direction of the positive z-axis in Dimension X, at a particular speed, s. Would a 3+1 dimensional world (Dimension Z) pass the deity? We know that the 3+1 dimensional world must pass through Dimension X before passing any other spatial dimensions. Thus the speed of the body of the deity would have to be equal to or higher than its own native dimensionality. How would this affect the speed of the deity? Well let's imagine that the speed of the body of Dimension X is v=s=λ. Well we could say that s, λ, and v are equal! The question to ponder then is how much more than their native dimensionality the speed of the body of the deity would need to be for it to be able to pass through any of our space-time dimensions at a comparable speed!

It turns out that since this object can enter the dimensions at speeds that equal its own native dimensionality, the speed with which it can travel through each dimension must be such that we can still pass it at these speeds! This means the speed of the body of Dimension X would need to be such that it would be able to pass through Dimension Z and Dimension P only if it had already entered into these dimensions at a speed that equaled s*λ/v! After gaining a certain amount of time by passing through Dimension X (as long as it stayed inside Dimension Z), it would be able to enter into Dimension Y at a speed larger than s, and so on. So the speed that we need to add to s to pass our own native dimensionality would be bigger than the speed of the body of the deity would need to be to pass through all dimensions at a comparable speed!

So deities in all of existence move freely through Dimension X without any restrictions at all! There really seems to be no barrier to being transported from one space-time dimension to another.

However, there is a problem: how would a deity make the transition from a Dimension X to any other space-time dimension? Is there a way for a deity to travel between spaces/times as rapidly as possible in Dimension X without actually moving from one dimension to another?

As you can see, deities have the ability to enter different dimensions at varying speeds. To make this possible, a certain amount of time is required for the deity to completely make the transition from Dimension X to Dimension Y; in other words, the time spent moving from Dimension X to any other space-time dimensionality must be equal to the time spent moving from Dimension X to a comparable speed of Dimension Y. And since deities move constantly in Space-time, it is not necessary for the duration spent on this journey to be identical to the equivalent duration spent moving from Dimension X to any other dimension (this is called "acceleration").

However, the time spent on this journey must also be able to equal the duration spent on the equivalent journey up until and including Dimension X - it is necessary there that we be able to "accelerate" the body of the deity just in case of any kind of accident! However, this is not what happens
