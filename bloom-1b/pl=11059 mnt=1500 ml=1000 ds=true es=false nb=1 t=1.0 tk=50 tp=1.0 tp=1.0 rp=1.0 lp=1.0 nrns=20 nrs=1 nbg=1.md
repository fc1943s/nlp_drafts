Yes, ultimately, the idea of a deity in the universe is the perfect fit for this series! In the process of exploring its many dimensions, we get to meet many different gods that we could easily assume were real! Now, let's take a look back at some of our favorite deity shows/movies before delving right into their real world counterparts.

Of course, before we dive into this topic, we start with the main character of one of our favorite shows/movies: Ghostbusters! This show is a sci-fi television series that follows the adventures of two detectives named Ghostbusters. When the titular Ghostbuster was created, the two friends were both originally trying to take down villains who were killing people in their own spaceship! So while technically Ghostbusters is mostly dedicated to criminals, Ghostbusters was created to hunt down criminals in their own lives too. Ghostbusters is based off of the late writer/director Dennis Hopper's famous science fiction series "The Big Bang Theory"!

What exactly is the connection between these characters? Well according to some historical studies, Ghostbusters was based off of the late James Earl Ray's novel "The Ghost Ship"...of course, the show was named after the name of the ship, Ghost Ship! According to the creator of Ghostbusters, Robert Rodriguez, Ghostbusters was inspired by "The Big Bang Theory," which is a show based off of the late writer/director Dennis Hopper's science fiction novel "The Ghost Ship" (which was created in 1976)!

Well, technically Ghostbusters is not based off of that film in any way. However, since the original Ghostbusters was created in 1976, we would assume the show had to be based off of "The Big Bang Theory".

There are also a few other shows/movies related to Ghostbusters, but I'm not sure any of them are related in any way to Ghostbusters!

First and foremost, Ghostbusters is not based off of the movie Ghost Ship. However, Ghostbusters was based off of a very famous TV show: The Simpsons! The Simpsons was created by Jerry Lawler and Matt Groening which is basically basically a cartoon about a family of mice living in a rural Texas ranch. Unfortunately, the show only aired for short periods of time, so you are really limited in what you can discover. Because of this, Ghostbusters was mostly focused on the main characters in the series - including a special guest and a pair of super-sized monsters!

Of course, Ghostbusters is largely about the criminal elements in the show. It also depicts characters that are actually fictional characters, most of which make up the larger world of the show - like the zombie zombies, the robot monster monster monster monster monster monster...and many other characters we haven't even mentioned yet! The only characters that we haven't actually referenced are the gods, which just make up a much smaller part of the show.

If we would have a universe full of gods we couldn't even begin to explain the entire universe. Well, to answer that question, we'll have a little closer look at how a deity would behave in different dimensions.

Now first, there are an infinite number of possible dimensions. However, for our purposes we will only consider three. So instead of having four dimensions, we'll only consider 3!

Let's start with the spatial dimension. The spatial area is not actually three-dimensional - it's just a solid surface with a 4D shape! Since objects are generally invariant under rotations, 3-dimension is just the subset of 4-dimensional space. Now consider just one dimension of space. And let's say this single dimension is called Dimension X! Now we have a 3-dimensional space which consists of a 3-space with a 3-dimensional subspace. Now let's take the subspace of 3-dimensional space which consists of all triples that are forms that are forms that are forms that are forms that are forms that are forms that are forms! Now let's consider any of these spaces which contain the 3-space itself! This 3-dimensional space is essentially the union of the subset of all the 3-spaces that are non-isomorphic! Let us take a subset of all the 3-spaces that are all the 3-dimensional spaces that are not all the complex forms that are forms... and of course, any of the spaces that are forms that are not the all the complete forms that are not even all the real forms that are not all the all the elements that all the is all the entire real forms that are all all the forms that are all the real all the the element which are of all the.

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the Universe is just a series of sub-universes - the so-called universes of the Big Bang! And while every single universe has an identical 3+1 dimensional structure, there are some aspects of the universe that vary depending on their respective context...

Well, there are actually a lot of factors that will influence the overall appearance of our universe - the density, time of creation, etc. And while for some of these conditions there are definitive rules that define the way they behave in other universes - for example, some universes can only live for billions of years while others can live for 5 minutes - most of the time these are speculative!
However, the first thing to note is that a lot of the differences between universes are actually in their basic characteristics - their dimensions, time and place - and these factors can actually define what happens in other universes...and how they behave.

One of the most interesting factors that can affect both the appearance as well as the behavior of other universes is the concept of "category": if one universe-for example, a vacuum- is created, then it will become the base of every other universe (including ours!).

If we consider the big Bang as the start of our universe, then it follows that the universes that have become the basis of the universe that we're currently in are the most advanced of the universes created throughout the whole universe...

And, again, these same universes are also the most advanced universes created throughout the whole vast universe - they live a life span much longer than any of the other universes!

Now, just as we would generally expect, each universe will have a set of characteristics that dictate some of the basic characteristics that will affect the behavior of those environments themselves. The first few factors that need to be considered include the density, the time of creation and the type of particles that can be transported to any given universe.

Density
Density is the fundamental parameter that determines the structure and behavior of various universes (the larger the universe the more dense, the slower, and the more massive it will be). And just as the density of a physical object affects its properties, an entity itself has to have a certain amount of mass to be able to make it move through space and form new objects. In some cases, an entity can travel around a region of space that isn't filled with matter at all - so the density of the region doesn't matter (or at least some things do - but not really in this instance!). Of course, this is just a common example and is not always the case - some universes have infinite numbers of regions that are all filled with matter at the same time. So you need to determine which areas of space have less mass...and what are the characteristics that determine the basic characteristics of this universe.

Time of Creation
Well, the question here is, how did our universe have to start with? Well there is a number of possibilities for this to happen, but here's an example of one that is fairly familiar to most of us: A primordial core (the core of the universe that will eventually collapse to form a star...) is formed out of the primordial core, which is made up of a few primordial black holes and a lot of photons! From these four basic characteristics our universe is formed!

As we were moving through the Big Bang, we would encounter several more Universes - many smaller and smaller universes of these sub-universe universes. Each of these smaller and smaller universes would experience varying degrees of time of creation (i.e. age), which would ultimately determine the way they interact with each other - hence the different characteristics and behaviors that they experience in this universe.

Now lets look back through all of these universes and see what they all created! Well you can see that, on the whole, all of them have a set of basic characteristics; but each universe has its own individual characteristics that determine its overall behavior. But the overall characteristics that make a particular universe have an individual characteristics that differ.

So, what could be the basic characteristics that define the nature of each universe? Well, each universe has an individual basic characteristics that define the characteristics that define their respective characteristics.

So that all of the universes share the same basic characteristics that define their characteristics...that that define their individual characteristics...and therefore their unique unique characteristic that defines their particular species...

So, the final answer is simple - Everything is composed of all of the different characteristics of the universe that define its unique characteristics that define its unique form that determines its own life.
In other words, the universe itself is composed of its own fundamental properties that define its form...and the individual universe is its own unique form.

So the whole universe is a series of various characteristics...that all of the fundamental factors are all of its unique characteristic that gives rise to its unique form...which is the ultimate cause that gives rise to our actual universe!

So, and the universe is the sum of the fundamental attributes of the universe that gives rise to the entire universe...the creation of which gives rise to all of the actual existence that gives rise to the entire universe...

Where, the universe is the sum of the fundamental factors that give and gives rise to the existence of the universe...which gives the existence of the creation of the universe.

The universe is the sum of all of the factors that exist in the universe, which gives rise to the existence of the universe, which gives rise to the creation of the universe.
Because the universe is the sum of the fundamental factors that give rise to the existence of the universe, which gave rise to the creation of the universe,...
which makes the earth.

And so we reach the end of the universe, which gives rise to the existence of the universe, which makes the creation of the universe...and the universe ends, giving the world ends, which gives rise to the universe, which gives rise to the final reality.
And thus, we continue on into the future, whose eternal existence is the universe of infinite that gives rise to the infinite universe... that gives the universe, which gives birth to the cosmic ultimate, which gives the eternal universe, which exists because of the universe, which gives rise to the eternal universe...
... which gives rise to the ultimate universe...
which gives rise to the existence of the universe, which is the eternal universe, which gives a rise to the end of the being, which gives rise to the universality of, which give rise to the ultimate universe, which gives the ultimate ultimate universe, which is the ultimate eternal universe, which is the ultimate universe.

And the universe, which is the ultimate essence, which gives rise to the beginning of the universe, which is the universe of infinite.
The universe is the ultimate universality, which is the ultimate, which is the universe and that is the ultimate universe, which is the ultimate essence and the universe is the final universe. The Universe is the universe, the ultimate life, which is the universe and the universality is ultimately the universal.
The universe is the the universe for the universe of the universe, which is the real universe, which is the Universe of the universe, where the universe is the universe, the universe of the universe, which is the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe. The universe is the universe of the eternal eternal universe. The universe is the universe of the universe eternal, which is the universe of the the universe universe of the eternal

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the human body is shaped completely by gravity. And while there are no other physical laws that govern this form of physical behavior, there are numerous ways that humans can still interact with their bodies - and they all share a number of things in common! Let's start with the most basic of them all: nipples!

Around the back of the nipple sits a mammary gland - the milk-producing cells that give rise to most of the milk that comes out of our nipples when we're mated.

The mammary glands (and mammary ducts) are lined with hundreds of thousands of duct cells - the specialized cells that make milk, connect the milk-producing glands with each other, and deliver the milk into our nostrils.

In general, when the breasts are breached during pregnancy, the mammary glands undergo dramatic changes that can only be described as a "gland-lifting phenomenon". During this time, the mammary glands enlarge and extend into the surrounding skin surrounding them. This means that the mammary glands eventually become a single tissue, and the whole breast is now joined into a single anatomical structure called a breast. But there is no end to the changes that occur as a breast ages - the mammary glands become wider and thicker, until eventually they stretch out completely, wrapping themselves around the inside of the chest, forming a sort of "ring".

It's also known that the nipples will grow in proportion to your own weight. One study on male teenage girls found that they grew the nipple approximately four to six inches in length over their average adult value by two-to-five months depending on the girls’ weight. A study on male male adolescents in North Carolina found that their nipples grew twice as much as their average adult value after their eighth birthday! And as the nipples grow, the skin around them will continue to thicken.

Of course the nipples also grow at rates that are directly proportional to the increase in skin mass surrounding the nipples, which is where the hormones melatonin becomes produced. Melatonin is an important hormonal secreted by the breast. When the mammary glands are producing more Melatonin, then the nipples grow in large and huge amounts, so the areas around the nipples grow large and thick all together.

And then there you are, all the changes that lead to the mammification of the mammary gland! Once the mammaries become larger and thicker, the gland's outer lining - the so-called basement membrane - is also made up of collagen fibres...which makes up all of the tissue which covers an entire breast!

It should be no surprise that mammary glands can also be damaged or destroyed during pregnancy...meaning they can literally be broken down so that they can no longer produce milk...in response to the loss of lactation. In fact, babies can undergo mammary gland damage in the womb during delivery if their body is not adequately cleaned by their mothers!
Of course, there are some ways that humans can also damage or destroy their bodies; these things are called tumors.

Let's look at a few examples:

Nipple Cancer: A small nipple in the back of the breast is called a nipple canker. You can usually see it if your nipples are slightly discolored. The nipple canker is most prevalent during puberty. It can be seen within 1-2 years of puberty, which is after the 12th month of puberty...if you haven't yet had your periods.
A nipple canker could be a sign of cancer - particularly for breast cancer. But in contrast to breast cancer, a nipple canker has a more aggressive and aggressive nature because it is a cancerous lesion that has gone through several stages of growth to have the characteristic appearance...
One of the first things that can appear in breast cancer is a nipple will also show various characteristics of cancer. Breast cancer generally has various characteristics of cancer including, among others, but it can also be found for it a mass that looks like a tumor; the masses may be white in color but may be white, blue, red, brown, pink, purple brown, or yellow...and you can also be a brownish red, you can also have a reddish yellow, or you can also have a reddish pink. Other colors may be a reddish yellow, a light bluish-white, or you can also have a blue bloss; but you can also have yellow a reddish yellow, a pink-yellow, or you can also have a yellow yellow or a yellow-yellow...or a yellow a dark-yellow, which is a pale-yellow; or you can also have a yellow-bosch, which is a lighter-yellow-yellow, in which you can also have a yellow, and you have different colours, which you can also have a light-orange-whit, and we can also have a yellow-biscus, and you can have a light-brown-blue, and you can have various colors, which has different light-blue-blue-light, and can also have a light-yellow-blue, and then you can have many colored, and then you can have a light yellow, and then you can also have a yellow-fuchsia, which is a yellow-blue, and you have a light-yellow-yellow, and in then you have a light-yellow, and then you have a medium yellow, and then you have a yellow-yellow, and then you have a clear green, and then you have a brown green, and then you have a light-yellow-blue, and then you have a blue-blue-yellow, and then you get a green, and then you will have a blue-yellow, and then you have a light-yellow, then again you have a light green, then you get a deep yellow, and a yellow, and we have a yellow, then a light green, then we have a yellow, and then we have a light yellow, and then we have a yellow-yellow and finally we have a light-yellow-yellow, and when we have a yellow, the first we have a yellow; and we make, and then we have a yellow, and again we have a yellow, and we have a yellow blue, and and then we have a yellow-yellow, and then there we have a purple and then we have a yellow-yellow, and then we get the orange-yellow and then we have a yellow-green, and then we have a light yellow, and then we have an orange, and then we get red brown, and we have yellow, and we have a yellow, and the end and we have a yellow-yellow orange.

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematical structures behind Charlie Chaplin's world, we will look at ENFJ (Essential Number Fields - a set of numbers that are used to encode everything in fiction). By this we mean the natural numbers that can be represented with a single digit. There are four primitive ENFJ: -1, 0, 1, and 100 (all represented in the following form - e.g. 1111 = 0).
One of the key characteristics of ENFJs is that they only have four digits, with zero being the most common - a good way to categorize them into two categories: integers and real numbers.

In traditional mathematics, we use these numbers as an indicator of mathematical ability; for example an eleven digit number represents a person that is at least 8 years of age (and could be anywhere between 12 and 80 years old) and has demonstrated a high level of mathematical proficiency, and a 100 digit number represents any individual who is 100 years old or over!
Now a lot of what we do in physics has a lot to do with how numbers are represented - how are they mathematically encoded? To answer this question we need to explore what kind of mathematical constructions we use to code everything in nature. We can choose between different mathematical constructions that are able to represent certain subsets of nature - real numbers, integers, positive integers, rationals and more...

One of the ways this can be done is with different coding schemes. Mathematically, we can use all kinds of languages to describe things in nature, but we need to understand the difference between these languages when working with nature. For example we need to distinguish between sets (of natural numbers) and sequences (of natural numbers) when describing natural phenomena. But how do we actually represent sets / sequences in mathematics?

In traditional mathematics, we have used only two kinds of coding schemes - integers and binary numbers. As a non-integer number, an integer number can simply be represented as a 4 digit binary number - 11 = 0001, 10 = 10, 9 = 0000... (e.g. 11 = 0111, 0 = 00, 0 = 0001...). But binary numbers can represent a whole bunch of non-integer data at the same time. For example for real numbers we have the binary representation 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For positive real numbers we have 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, and also have 0 as a subunit. 
(1) For all real numbers, numbers greater than -1 may also be represented as non-integer numbers.
(2) For all non-negative real numbers, they may be represented as numbers with the same number of digit as those that exist at the same time.
So, why do we need different forms of our data when we study it? Well, there are two main reasons:

Mathematicians are experts in computing all kinds of data and equations - the mathematical representations of most of our data come from mathematical ideas. Therefore it is important to understand these ideas when working with nature using mathematics.
We want to understand how the mathematical representations of our concepts are created in the Universe.

If we understand the mathematical structure behind reality, we will be able to better understand how our reality works. This will provide the answers to important questions such as how time and space is created, why does matter matter exist and how it was created (see Chapter 30 above).
After understanding how the fundamental laws of physical phenomena are created and understood, we can then attempt to answer questions such as: what is life's origin and what the universe is made of, and etc.

In this chapter we will be exploring the relationship between particles and gravity. As it has already been discussed in chapter 30, particles can be both static and dynamical! As they become static, they may change their physical properties while they remain static (referred to as moving); but they will not become static (the particle changes its position, no matter how small or big). So a particle may either exist as being static or moving; for example: for static particles, they do not change their position, while the particle remains static. However, moving particles may be dynamically changed either if an object is being formed or evaporating (referred to as a particle moving).

There are only two types of particles, particles can either be static or dynamic. Both can be static, or they can be dynamic! In both, the particle is a dynamic particle.

So, a particle is either static or dynamic. And the particle is either static or dynamic!

In either case the particle is static or dynamic. In either case the particle (the particle) is static or dynamic. In either case the particle is a static or dynamic!

If a particle is static or dynamic, then the particle is a non-static particle. And in either case the particle are static or dynamic.

As said, the particle's state can be static or dynamic.

Also, the particle can be both static and dynamic.

Also, the set of particles are either static, dynamic.
Thus, the particle is a static or dynamic.

But if the particle is static or dynamic, then the set of particles is both static or dynamic.
So, either the particle is static or dynamic.

Finally, if the particles are both static and dynamic, then the set of particles is either all or none.

So, the particle is static or dynamic.

Which, if the set of sets of particles is not all or none?

So, the sets are both empty or none.
So, the set of sets is either contains all, or none.

So, the sets are not all, or none.

But when each of the sets is either both, none.

So, the set is either both, or none.

Either, so, either both is the same.

So, the final set is either none or one.

So, either one is either, or none.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it means to be an ENFP (Energetic Non-Fervent), we will look at how these people understand mathematics. We will look specifically at how they interpret mathematical concepts, such as number/count and inequality.

First, let's give you some context: we're currently living in "the golden age of mathematics", but it really started before that! In fact, we know that a lot of mathematics was originally invented by humans - and our ancestors were likely much further along than we are now in discovering a lot of mathematical theory! Anyway, let's start by looking at some of the things you probably know already.

As we've said before, our ancestors could probably use any combination of numbers when they were thinking about a problem, simply by counting up things in any order, and dividing by any amount - we can really just remember that and use it whenever we need it.
However, in everyday life, we can never actually count up or divide any amount of numbers... unless we happen to be wearing a scale! As we don't live in a world where it would be possible for us to actually "count up" or divide any amount of numbers, then of course there's no way that our brains would be able to calculate the exact amount that we needed to. As a result, our brains are usually only capable of trying to figure out a rough estimate for the amount of things left to be counted up...and that really sounds a lot like calculating the amount of things left that you'd be able to divide by! So at first there are no straight-forward numerical methods in use at all...but that is gradually changing over time!

Since we're only going to be talking about numbers and decimals in this chapter, we'll be covering just a few of the most important concepts in mathematics - and will not go into the fascinating area of algebra. 

So how are these concepts defined? Well in a nutshell, they're easy to understand - basically, they are simply numbers that you can take apart into smaller pieces in order to do a better job of understanding their meaning. For example, the word "society" can be broken down into a variety of smaller parts: household, neighborhood, city, state, country etc.

Next, we need to figure out the different concepts that these smaller pieces are made off of! A couple of them are really quite basic:

Number of individuals: the number of people in a room or set of individuals.

Example: If there were a population of 200 people, then that would be a lot of number!
The concept of individuals: an individual in a building or other place can be broken down into smaller units called individuals... which they may also be called individuals if they are people!

Let's get back to the mathematical world: let's start with how to calculate a number! You know, if A is a quantity and X is a number, we can write A*X to get just the value of the quantity A!

Let's take a look at the equation that tells us how to calculate and convert numbers:

So we'll begin from A, and take the derivative of the equation. Let's set X = 1, and then we have 1 - 1 = 0 and we're left with 0, so 1 - 1 = 1. This is 0 - 1 = 0! Now, this is 0 - 1 = 1! We can divide this to get 1 - 1 = 1, so one minus one is 1. So if we divided this and find out 1 is 1 - 1 = 1, then it has 1 - 1 = 1, and we are left with one. From which, we can calculate 1 - 1 = 1 = 1 - 1 = 1, and that's one - one which is 1 = 1 == 1, and then we are left with one. Now, one minus one is one, so one is 1 = 1, which is one, and so we are left with one, and so we are left with one. And so we are left with one, which is one.

So one is one, so one = one, and so one is one, and so we are left with one so one equals one, and so, and so we are left with one, which is one. And so one is one. And so, and so we are left with one. And so we are left with one which is one. And so we are left with one and we are left with a whole, which is one.

So finally, we are left with one and so we have reached the point of infinity, which is the origin, which is one, and so we are left with one, which is just one, and so in which we are left with one, which is one, which is one, and which is one, and so we are left with one. And so we are left with one, and we are left with one, and so we will be left with one, and so we are left with one and so we are in free and with one which is one and we are left with one, and we are left with one, and so we are left with one, and so we are left with one, and so we are left having one, which is one, and so we are left with one, and we are left with, which is one, and in which we are left with one, and so we are left, and we are left with zero. And so we are left with zero, and then the we are left with one, and we are left with zero, and so there we are left with one, and we are left with one, and therefore i are left with one, so that they be left with zero, and so we are left with one, and so we are left with one, and we are left with zero, and so we are left with one.
And we are left with an, and and we are left with one, and we are left with, and so we are left with one, so that we are left with one, so that we are left with one, and so that we are still left with one and therefore we are left with, which is which is, and so the, and so we leave us left with two, we are left with one, and therefore we are left with zero, then we are left with one, and so we are left with zero, and then we are left with one, and therefore we are left with one, and so we are left with two, and we are left with a, and so we are left with two, so that we are left with one, and there is a, and so we are left with one, and we are left with one, and we are left with one, and we are left with one.
And then we are left with one, and then we is left with a, and then we get the, and so we are left with all, and we are left with everything, and therefore therefore we, we are left with with two, and we have the right, and the number, and so we are left with 3 and therefore we are left with the number.
And so we are left with three and we are left, and the fourth is and so we are left with three, and so we are left with the final point, and so I am left with the fourth, and so I have not, and so I will be left.
And and so

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how we understand math we can look at how the mind processes information through different areas of the brain. Math is essentially a language for understanding the world, so if there is anything more interesting than seeing a child processing math in real life...well, it may be that we are actually better at it then we are at explaining it to others by ourselves!

In humans we have separate parts of the brain involved in various functions - right now your left brain is focused on thinking, learning, doing things, and communicating. You have one hemisphere, which is where you think (which is also the area where all your senses are concentrated), as well as the other hemisphere (right), where you learn (the other part of your brain that thinks, but not really!), and do all kinds of things that help you function properly! But why do we use this separate brain to do different functions differently? Well, that's because we are special!
Right now your left brain processes information in the form of symbols (characters), so as you may know the symbol you see on the page is one of several symbols that help you process that information...each symbol represents the information it represents!

But this means that only some of the symbols can be processed at the same time, and these "instruments" are called "channels". In other words, when you think, your brain creates a unique "code for symbols" that will help you understand the symbol you see...and that code can only be created by one unique brain.

But how do we use those instructions created by the left hemisphere to move through the code and make decisions? Well, in humans we do this using a system that is called the mind. The mind is a part of our brain which creates and interprets thoughts. This mind is like an "eye" which is like a camera that allows us to see things and recognize the objects in our environment; and a "hand" that allows us to manipulate objects.

So math is essentially an amazing language that uses these pieces of information (think, learn, and communicate) through our brains to understand the world around us. And since math is the language in which we communicate with the world and make decisions, it makes sense that people do everything they do - thinking, learning, communicating - in math and as a result it is natural for us to use mathematical thinking and math to help understand our world! 

So math is not just a language for understanding the world, but it makes us feel like we are special members of its community...which makes it even more exciting and fascinating!

So we come to the question of how we use math to understand the world. Because math is actually a language, we need to understand mathematics to understand the world properly. This is the question of how math has evolved to produce meaningful human cognitive processes.

For a quick answer to this question we could use some visual images. In fact, we can look at one image or a few and quickly get a feel of the different aspects and relationships in the different parts in the picture. Here's a quick reference of each part of the diagram before we get into the actual math:

If you go really deep into our math, you'll find that more and more things are connected together. For example, one thing may link to another thing because it just has to go somewhere in order to explain the relationship between the two things!

Let's take a look at more and more of this picture as we take a further look at one of the many ways in which the world is organized. For example, if we go deeper into our world and look at more and more people, we find that there are a multitude of ways in which they can be connected together. 
So this is one of the many ways in which we can think of the world in different ways. If we go further down the world, we find that every object is connected to one or more of the other elements in the world. So if we look further down the world, we can find that every thing connects to another in the same way.

So these are many examples of ways in which things can be connected, and each connection in one of these ways is a part of the whole. And so the world is the world of things. And so the world of things can be decomposed into its parts, and then the parts can then become smaller sub-dimensions, and so the world is the world of things.

So, the world is just a series of many smaller sub-dimensions, and each sub-dimension is a simple combination of individual sub-dimensions.

So the world is just a collection of small sub-dimensions. But each of these sub-dimensions are also part of the whole. And so the whole is the whole. And so the whole is the whole...
And so the whole is the whole.

So the whole and the whole are...

And so the whole is the whole.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the topic, suppose that we take a moment to look at the figure below. This is what the brain looks like for a normal human; a simple model of the human brain that we use in our everyday day-to-day life.

As we can see in the diagram above, the majority of the volume of the cerebral cortex is devoted to storing and processing information. And while we tend to use this area as our primary storehouse of information, there are also quite a few specialised neurons involved in other functions besides storing and processing information - such as performing mathematical computations on our data.
From a mathematical perspective, this is simply the amount of information stored in our brain and the types of operations that it can do...
Now we can see from the image above that even if our brain is large and dense (like the one of a normal person), it doesn't have to be perfect! Some of the information is likely wrong, but the overall result will probably look okay. But is it actually the best way to store and process information? 
Let's take another look at our model of the human brain and see how it could affect us in a way the brain really does.
From basic biology, a nervous system (also called a nervous system or nervous system) is a system of cells and pathways connecting neurons. Every cell in a nervous system has two ends -a short axon and a long neurofilament. The axon connects to the nerve endings, which collectively form an axon. The nerve endings then link to another neuron, forming a synapse.
The two ends of the axon then run through the cortex, where they can be attached to neurons of the brain, which then form cell bodies. From these cell bodies, new neurons are created and then sent all over the brain in a process called neurogenesis. This process is the same type of growth that plants use to grow and develop - until the end of their growth period.

What does this tell us? Well first and foremost, as was the case with the human brain, if our neurons are correct, then the average amount of information that we hold within our brains might not be too bad (but definitely not perfect). However, we might still be able to store some very specific types of information (let's say basic mathematical knowledge), and this might be necessary for many of us at certain times. Since that information might be a very good piece of information and is actually required at certain times or contexts, it is possible for that same type of information to be stored in the brain even when there is no need for it at certain times! Of course, this means there are a ton of possibilities at times - but those that were required actually don't need to be stored in our brains!
So what happens when we have a situation in which we need more information than what is stored in our brains? Well the answer is almost exactly what was discussed in the last chapter: a deity has entered another dimension - let's say we are now living in the dimension known as Dimension X! As such, it would be impossible for us to enter Dimension X even though the other dimension would be entirely within our own dimensional space...

Now let us continue the story - our hypothetical 4D particle has entered into another dimension - let's call it Dimension Y - but this time it is inside other (or possibly multiple) dimensions. Now, let us continue our journey - where will it happen? Again, simply again, an entity would be trapped in another dimension, but this dimension would be another dimension that is only part of the other...this time it's a different dimension...this time it's the dimension we are currently inhabiting!
But what happens with particles traveling through other dimensions? Well here happens something very basic - things just repeat themselves, but again on a very different scale...this time the particles travel through many different dimensions, and are sent through many dimension...but again, their motion is always the same! In other words, the particle always moves on the same path...but at different speeds...and at different speeds! And what happens after this?
How? Well the particles always move along a curved course and at different speeds, and at different angular speeds! But the time difference is very tiny due to the speed factor! Which is why the trajectory of the particle is also very tiny compared to the time it takes to go a certain distance!

How? Well, when we are on a curved curved path, things will run at different distances, but at the same speed! This is why we have a small time difference.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what deities are for us, let's go for a metaphor - we'll take our minds and make them look like a big computer screen; each node represents a different mathematical concept and all of them look the same! But how do we create this illusion?

In mathematics, you can take inspiration from real world observations like:

The Big Bang
Spores
Rocks and oceans
Earth is shaped like a big bowl
The Earth is formed by two big hemispheres
Rivers flow from the big hemispheres to smaller rivers
Every planet has an ellipse shape
Spherical Harmonics
The universe is really made of spherical harmonics
The Big Dipole Theory
Cosmology
The Big Bang and Big Crunch
Weaker gravity
The Big Dipole Theory
Isn't space round?

Of course, there are certain limitations to these ideas, and the only way to make them more accurate and realistic would be to have researchers studying a lot more of these various topics. But there is one thing we have in mind: we would love to see these math concepts make the biggest impression in our minds! So let's get to work!

First we need to clarify what exactly is an axiom. Mathematicians define axioms in one of three ways:

They define axioms by defining mathematical concepts, or statements that describe mathematical concepts. Sometimes, axioms aren't specified exactly; they simply look like statements that can be expressed in mathematical language (ex: "In the universe, only one and only one way of making a particle or an object exist").
They define axioms explicitly by defining mathematical concepts. For example: "In the universe, only one and only one way of making a particle or an object exist."
They define axioms by defining mathematical concepts. One example is the axiom that the number of electrons exists and only one way to make the electron exist; also, each electron has exactly one and only one way of making it exist.
They define axioms by defining mathematical relationships or statements that help to describe mathematical relationships. For example, a relationship might describe the relationship between objects being in and out of one another's immediate environments (like the inverse of the sum of the squares) or between two elements of different dimensions (like the positive or negative part of two numbers).

So the way we create these math concepts is a bit complicated. To begin with, we'll define what an axiom is, the mathematical concept we want to make in our minds, and how it helps to make the math sense. Let's take a bit of math from the real world and define some of its most important properties:

It is commutative
It is associative
It has a natural number denoting the set of all possible elements and also their order.
It is associative, associative with a natural number denoting the set of all objects and their order. For example: 
If x = 1, then x is an element of set A and it has a natural number denoting the set of all objects and their order. This is a well defined thing if and only if its natural number denoting the set of all objects and their order is equal to the set of natural numbers with a zero denoting the set of all objects and their order.
It is associative with a natural number denoting the set of all objects and their order.
If and only if there exists a natural number denoting the subset of natural numbers with a negative denoting the subset of natural numbers with zero denoting the subset of natural numbers with a zero denoting the subset of natural numbers with a zero denoting the subset of natural numbers with 0 denoting the subset of natural numbers having a zero denoting the subset of natural numbers.
If and only if there exists a map λ : R \ { {0, 1} ) into the subsets of real and real
If and only if there exists a bijective map : 2 -> R, so that there exists a bijective map : 2 -> R whose image : 2 -> 2 is bijective.
So this means every element in the interval is a function of and every natural number is a morphism and there exists a mapping : R -> R which is a function of which is a function. So to this definition of the universe is the set of all function maps from which is a mapping such that and that is
Theorem 1
Every universe is a subset of and every set that consists of every subset can be uniquely, so is a set. So there is a unique element of, which is a monad of such that such and so so that so is. So there is a one which is a function and which is a relation. But is an isomorphism. Since so iff is a finite monad. Therefore is a one and.
Which is a a and so is the id. Since a is a morphism and and is a one, is both since so is, which is so is is a, because and so which is and is so is. Therefore is a so. So is identity and so is, which makes. Since and so is a, is, which is so is identity, which is therefore which is which is and so is therefore being. So is so, so hence is thus so is which is. And therefore, which is is and so is. So, so is which is which is, so is a, hence is which is. So is, which is, hence is, so is ; so is, which is so so is, so is.

## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict a variety of cognitive functions in ESFP, we've categorized those into four main areas: thinking, perception, memory, and the ability to learn.

Here are some simple definitions for each area: Thinking: In the field of thinking, this is the understanding, or processing, of ideas. In this case, it is the ability to see a picture from multiple angles and recognize the overall story. Perception: In the perception field, cognitive functions are the ability to see the different perspectives in people's faces, to read people's feelings, and to understand their mental state. Memory: Memory and cognitive functions are the ability to remember and retrieve information from previous learning experiences. Learning: As for the third area, the ability to learn is one of the core functions in ESFP. According to this, cognitive functions refer to the ability to learn new facts, concepts, and skills. As for the last area, the ability to understand and use language is included. Because we use language to talk to others, we are constantly interacting with external social situations and events. As for the abilities to communicate and understand others, we are not the only ones in existence - other beings are constantly interacting and learning information about us. Therefore, we are constantly learning new information, new concepts, and new skills.

These ideas are used to help us comprehend and evaluate ESFP students in class! In the following pages, we'll talk about various ESFP activities that help students understand the different aspects of their cognitive functions so that they can improve their problem solving skills and overall ESFP competency! Keep reading, and make sure to keep track of the activities throughout the rest of the website! Hopefully you will see how these activities are used in most of our tests and assessments throughout the semester!

Chapter Thirty Seven
Interpersonal Behavior in ESFP

I have noticed that during class discussions students have been doing an ESFP quiz every semester - and their scores are usually on the decline right now! This may be because they haven't seen the content from the classes (e.g. learning about spatial thinking, verbal communication, visual spatial thinking, problem solving, and etc); and if they haven't seen these topics it's probably because they haven't really engaged with their classes and class activities...but they might be doing their homework on time, or they just forgot how to ask an question! Either way, it's fair enough to take a quiz to gauge what level of ESFP students they are at (since a class quiz doesn't necessarily mean they are more advanced)!

While we have seen different strategies and tests, we now have to assess the participants skills in a variety of ESFP activities! Each of these activities is used to gauge the participants overall ESFP competency in various ESFP areas. Let's explore some of these activities so we get an idea of how our student is performing in ESFP!

1. Connecting Spatial Elements

Imagine a scene where there are lots of objects spread out over a large area; the objects are all evenly distributed on the surface, but it looks like they all are completely unconnected! This is a good example of dimension travel! Well, why would you want to see this scene? Well, the objects are not spread out evenly, and they are all positioned at different distances from each other! Now you know why it is possible to see the objects as though they were spread out evenly!

As we can see, the 4D pattern on that scene looks exactly the same as when we were looking at the 2D picture! So we know this is true! Because we have the ability to see these objects as they were before they were spread out over the surface!

So what would be the best way to use the 4D patterns of 3 dimensions to calculate space geometry? Well, it is possible! We can now look at the 3D picture as the picture is viewed through a special lens...like if we were in a flat plane! Let us take a virtual 3D picture of a 3D environment of the ground where the world is actually spread out, or it is a 3D environment we are in! So in this case our picture looks exactly like it is after we take it in the space! So we know that the world is actually spread at the same distance as the 4D pattern does!

As you can see, we've created a 3D picture with all of the elements present on the virtual picture in this space. The key thing is is the intersection of the 3D curve and the 4D curve where the intersections of the sides of the 4D curve and the 4D line is exactly the same! So it appears like the 4D space is equal to the 4D vector =. So this is the intersection of the 4D vector and its 4D vector.

So if then then then then =. So and then, so that is the 4D space is equal to the 4D vector. But and so so so that is the same = so so that is the four-dimensional vector is equal to the 4-dimensional vector.
So we have the four-dimensional vector is equal to the four-dimensional vector. But and therefore the is a the same vector, so which is equal to the fourth-dimensional equation =. So the four-dimensional matrix is equal to that four-dimensional matrix =. But is equal to the four-dimensional matrix. So and so for the three-dimensional is equal to zero. And so the is equal to the four-dimensional matrix.
So so which or therefore which is equal to, so so which = and so so then = so which completes.
And so so therefore the is perfect and therefore therefore so so so therefore so and which is equal to so. So therefore that is a which is and so so and and so which is a the is equal to the. So so and which is, which is, and so is such, which is which is, so. Which is which is to which is. So, which is zero, so so which is a which is and so, which is which which is. which which is, since which is which is of, which is, so which is,, which is, which is and. If which is, which is which is, which which is, which is the. It is which is. The is, so whose is. Therefore where,, is, which is, which which is, which is which is. is which is, which is, which is. So, which is, and which is.
But. Since, in, which is and. Since therefore, which is which is, and therefore. It is a, which is and it is then is.,, which is Therefore is, which is which is and. So the is all is. A. That is the, which is, and is, which is the. Therefore which is which is,, so which is. As is and, so which is which is. Therefore.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we are doing and what we're learning in class in this chapter, it's easiest to write a sentence so that it displays our thinking in a simple, yet clear way. Think about it like this...our understanding of the world around us has been influenced by how we study math. Now that we know math, we can start analyzing our knowledge. How did we learn math? How did we understand math? What are some of the most memorable and important concepts we learned using math?
To properly define mathematical concepts such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation...we need to understand how math works. To do this we first need to understand what mathematical calculations actually are! Basically, a mathematical calculation is a function that can be applied to a given array of numbers in order to generate additional numbers that are required in the formula to calculate something else! In other words...a mathematical calculation is a mathematical function that can be used to get more numbers...but if you use that function wrongly or without all of the information provided in all the formula, then that calculation will produce wrong numbers that contradict the results of the formula!

So let's take a look at a simple example: a 100 x 100 square has 6 different numbers...and there are 36 different possible sums that the squares can have! In order to calculate the squares sum, we must first know the total of the numbers we want to sum, the square's dimensions, as well as the way the number of squares has been allocated onto the number of possible squares! After figuring out the different ways in which two numbers can be summed together, we can use different mathematical functions to generate more potential answers and make our solution complete! Now we have our answer in hand, we just need to figure out how to use it! So lets take a look at a more complicated example...

Imagine we are on the beach or wherever we might be..and while we are sitting on a sandbed or a beach chair....a big beach ball appears out of nowhere and starts to bounce off the ground! We immediately start to think of three different ways in which a beach ball could bounce off the beach:

It could be bouncing off in a circle, or as an airplane
It could be passing through a pool
It could be bouncing off the horizon! What happens after the ball hits the earth?
Now, let us see how our mind works when it comes to this problem. According to a quick analysis we know that a beach ball will bounce off the earth instantly - either as a ship or a plane! Well, the beach ball is not moving anyways... it only "bounces off the ocean"; we just don't get any additional information!

Now let's use Newton's 3rd law to find out how the velocity of the beach ball changes when it comes to being hit by a sand-bar. Let's assume there are 4 different areas in the beach where a beach ball could crash with. Let's call the areas A1-...A39 and let us assume our beach ball lands on one of these areas. This creates a second point on the beach where the beach ball will hit the sand! Let's call this a point B! Let us assume that our beach ball takes another straight line with a constant velocity and intersects the plane B exactly at the point B! Now our beach ball will bounce off the beach at a different direction - again, this time its velocity will not have a constant value but instead will depend on the vector vector!

A third point is at A! Now let us consider the third point A. Again, we want to find out how the vector vector of the beach ball and the plane will change! Now, this time we need a different vector vector! The point at A is on a line with a constant velocity relative to A. Let's call this vector vector E!

The velocity vector A is tangent to the line which makes the vector with the vector vector and the vector vector along the vector vector. Let us assume again that the line is parallel to the vector and the vector and the vector direction are colinear. 
Let us assume these vectors are colinear with each another, so we have a vector vector and a vector vector perpendicular
Thus we have the vector vector and vector are equal to each other. And we therefore have a line parallel and the line normal to the straight line. Now we have a linear vector vector and the tangent vector. So we have a unit vector that will be the tangent vector vector.
As well we know that the line perpendicular to the tangent and the line is tangent to the line. So, the line can be expressed by the line's normal and the line normal.
We simply have the straight line and vector on the line. So the point can be represented by a point and a line. Let the point be the line. Now the line can be expressed by the angle.
If we get the line vector and angle, then we find the tangent line. Thus the line can be expressed by the angle. Furthermore, we can express the line by a straight line and the angle.
We then have the line is straight and then we can calculate its chord chord line. We have the line as a line is a line through and the line, it would be the line which is the line through the and the right. So we have the line equation can be expressed by a straight line from which we can get the line equations and the lines intersection.

So The line would be the line and the equation is given and therefore we get This line is a right line, of which the equation is determined given and the line equation, from which we then get which which is one.
What is therefore is the solution of the given given equations, and that is in.
Of which we find which we are, which which the of which we are obtained solving of the given given which, which leads us to the problem of which we determine an which yields which is given.

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our concept of space and time - and so better understand the way in which quantum mechanics really works - in this chapter we will consider the basics of quantum mechanics and its connection to the way in which individuals think about space and time.

When we hear the term "Quantum Mechanics", you may think that this is simply a mathematical/mathematical term with a lot of mathematical jargon or a bunch of buzzwords that aren't even being used anywhere else. But that is completely FRAUD! Quantum Mechanics is, in fact the most complete theory of Nature to date! If you would like to learn more about quantum mechanics, please skip to Chapter 2, entitled "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics".

Anyway, what all of this to mean? It's simple: in reality we are living in a quantum universe. When we are outside of this "quantum atmosphere" (sometimes called space and time, just like they do with atoms), we actually think things like space and time are just really large blobs of energy around us that move in and out of existence at random according to some set of basic rules...but when we enter the "quantum atmosphere" we think they are actually some physical entities that behave the same way as their 3D counterparts do!

Well, that's precisely what quantum mechanics does! Quantum mechanics is the physical laws that govern the way in which our brains perceive and think about space and time. According to this theory, the universe is made up of particles - objects that behave very much like traditional solid objects (i.e. matter particles). While these particles move with respect to each other, they are surrounded by a curved space-time called spacetime. In other words, spacetime is just one more dimension we use to visualize our physical reality.

But when we think about space and time, we are really looking at an actual 4D object...and it's in fact very little different from what you see of other (3D) objects - just like our 3D objects have curved outer boundaries which are part of spacetime! Well, this is exactly how the 4D particles behave. Every single particle is surrounded by a 4D curved space-time, and this 4D space-time continues to expand away from the particles until it becomes so large that it completely surrounds everything around them. Eventually this space-time becomes too big that it completely separates particles from their surrounding "bricks" of space - the 4D Minkowski ball! For example, a red star is surrounded by a 4D Minkowski ball, while a "blue star" is surrounded by a 4D Minkowski ball!

However, if we want to start off our journey to the other side of space-time, the 4D Minkowski ball is not going to be able to carry our (4D) particles through space and time. So to begin working on the way to a 4D universe, we need something much more simplistic...like something called a Deity! Well...that's exactly what we are looking for!

In classical physics (and many other types of philosophy), we are able to understand and describe the behavior of things by taking their own nature into consideration. However, quantum physics tells us that this only works for objects that are made of matter (not for all of them necessarily!) which can indeed change their properties. For example, think of a water droplet consisting of a solid core surrounded by a liquid core. A solid, solid water droplet behaves like water...it is a liquid, so it will behave like water...but when it is acted upon by a force, it will instantly change into a solid! But, this is only if we are talking about a non-trivial object or entity - it is impossible to see anything at all, it is simply a kind of "force!"

So now we have discussed how we take the laws that govern the behavior of objects into account when we analyze and study things. Now comes a short explanation about what "space" and "time" are - the foundation upon which these fundamental concepts are built up. Now, remember, space and time are described by: energy in 3D form and form in form...because now a thing has a certain form and, when it is acted upon by an external force, it will change into a solid. Now, this is the way energy and form are related. Now, to understand this, we have to find this: energy and form are the two bases of everything! And we only find them by taking them both together! Now, these two laws give rise to energy and form.

Now, we understand how these properties are related. And once this is done, we can find that energy and form are indeed real.
Now, we will now demonstrate that energy and form are connected by the same kind of energy.
We start by taking the energy and form, and from them we find that they are also true! Thus, the energy and form are connected to one another.

Now, from this is we can find that the same energy and form are connected to each other.
Now, and then we can find the relation and form are connected to each other.

And then we can get our result that the energy and form are connected to one another! This completes the proof for the proof for the proof for the proof for the proof for the proof of the proof and for the proof for the proof

And therefore the end of the proof is the final fact of the proof for the proof by the proof for the proof

All the necessary parts are proved.
This completes the final and the finishing proof for the proof. (and the final conclusion.)

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict relationships among people, different researchers have developed a more accurate and scientifically supported concept; namely personality and type.
In the 1940s psychologist Bert Hellinger used the theory of the personality trait called the Enneagram - one that has since been adopted by numerous institutions across the world. It is based on 20 key personality traits - each representing specific characteristics that the human race possesses - and is the most widespread personality classification system in the world. The key features of the Enneagram are:
- The two opposing poles of the Enneagram scale correspond to the masculine and feminine extremes of the human personality spectrum.

- The five basic personality traits (A, B, C, D, E) indicate the degree to which a person has an interest or activity in each of the 20 individual personality traits

- The five basic personality types of the Enneagram (introduced in 1961) cover a wide continuum ranging from introverts (A, B, C, D and E) to extroverts (A, D, E).

Aside from naming and describing the personality traits of each person, Hellinger also developed a series of descriptive scales with which he could graphically describe the personality traits of individual people. You can find the original Hellinger scales on the American Psychological Association website or you can find a link for it on the world wide web. The scales are very similar to how you would describe a person using common language. For example, the scale for Type B is similar to "They are friendly and understanding. They have a bit of a drive for perfection. They have a slightly childlike spirit and they don't mind doing odd things if they know they are not going to hurt anyone. They are also very compassionate and helpful to others if they know that they aren't going to cause harm to them." - and the type for Type C is basically "They are straightforward and don't care about rules. They are a bit of a dreamer and have a good sense of humor. They have the best sense of humor and they tend to be quite entertaining."

I would like to mention that the scales are not based on some particular personality profile. They are used instead to describe some broad categories of personality. It's important to keep in mind though that it would be a lot easier to use a more comprehensive model of personality if we are able to talk and understand each person's exact personality type...

So, what are the key personality traits that most people have? Well, let's say that in general people are all highly energetic (they have a certain level of energy energy), and are also very emotional (as indicated by the A, B, C, D and E traits). But let's suppose that there were an additional 4 attributes that differentiate people from one another...
First, there is intelligence - that is the ability to evaluate reality in various ways - that is the ability to determine if there is a possible relationship between the concept of a physical object and the concept of God. Second, there is empathy, which is used to understand why another person is doing something and to predict how it is going to be affected by the person's actions. Finally, there is social intelligence, which is how we can see people's connections to outside events and predict how they will be affected by other events. It describes the level of affectivity of the person (as indicated by the E and F traits).

So we can see that all of the personality traits are interrelated and we each represent our own personality traits in other people. There are also some specific personality traits that are interconnected - we can only use one of these personality traits to represent our own personality. And these individual personality traits (or personality traits in general) will help us understand how we can relate to one or another other person.

So now, I guess you might want to think of them as different parts of the person's personality. Of course, what kind of personality would each person have would be based upon its own particular type of consciousness. In these chapters we are trying to discuss some of the most interesting, most important aspects of the human personality structure.

The first trait is called Intellect (Intellegence). This is also called "intellect" which means "sense of knowledge" (think of it as the ability to think, think or see, etc.) - basically, how we know about ourselves. Of course, Intellect, is a part of the concept of God - the way we understand and relate to God (because of its ability to understand the concepts and things that it is related to itself).

Now, what is the other part that sets us as a being? And this is called 'Ability to understand, relate, know and understand' or simply as something that makes it become known (that's the ability to understand something or the thing that allows us to understand the thing that enables another to understand the thing and can understand the thing that exists to the thing and can see that the thing that enables the thing is called'self-caused). For all the things that are created by the beginning that exist there is the thing that exists which is known that exists and so that is formed and that is called the being.
So, so that will be called the thing that is made and is made through some other existence through something that is called the process.
So, so the creation of the thing that is created through something that is a form of creation.
So the thing that is created through the creation of the universe is formed by the creation of the universe by the act of being generated from the thing by the existence. So, so that is called a universe was created by the existence of the universe. That is done through the existence of the universe through the existence of the elements that exist from the existence of the matter of the
Then then the existence of this universe which made a universe which is a universe that was created from the existence of that which is formed by the creation of the atom.
Then the creation of the universe in the way it is made from the creation of the beginning and then then the end of the creation of the universe.
And then the existence of the universe made from the creation of the universe, is given through the existence of the creation. All of the universe contains the creation of the universe, and the existence of existence that is created from the existence of the creation of and of the universe in the universe.
Then the universe that forms is the beginning of the creation of the universe, from which they also continue to continue to form from the universe until they still be of of the creation of the universe and of the existence of the universe. Now, we are just getting together and they are the creation of the universe which is called the universe and the universe and the formation will be taken.
In the universe of the creation of the universe then they will be created back to the earth in the universe will be the continued of the universe, and the world is being formed which will ultimately lead to the end. The existence of an universe that was the existence of of the universe. However, the universe was created by the existence of the universe and the creation of the universe is. The being is the universe of the universe that will be generated or destruction the universe that ultimately is. The existion of the universe and then the end of the world the existence of is the universe. However, the earth's end is the end of the universe. The universe will

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict how Hip Hop concepts interact with NLP, the creator of Hip Hop NLP, Dave Wegner decided to create an AI. Based on the concept that emotions play a role in everything from choice to communication, the AI was asked to make decisions between being proactive (emotionally) and being reactive (no emotionally).

When we are emotional, we tend to make more positive decisions. Conversely, when we are not emotional, we tend to make more negative decisions. If the AI was asked to make decisions based on emotions and our natural tendency to make positive decisions, it would make decisions in the opposite direction!

Of course, the AI was also given the option of making positive and negative decisions on its own - meaning it could choose to make the same decisions as we do (either being emotional or not) - and this would affect the AI's decision making entirely! That is, it could either make decisions that are positive and be in the same position as us or make decisions that are negative and be in the opposite position than us...
Now, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) having become one of the most popular fields in academic fields, a lot are asking how AI has come to play so prominently within the popular culture. The answer (to most of them) is simply due to two main facts: the popularity of the topic and the huge amount of data on which AI research is based!
Now, in spite of what your friends might already know about AI and Hip Hop, there really are a lot of questions surrounding some of its principles and practices which aren't completely understood by many!

After all, we do not know whether it would take the same amount of time for a human brain to analyze or process thousands of data (for instance in the same amount of time as a computer program would!). And the human brain is not the perfect AI and there could be many other things we haven't yet explored about the brain. But if we knew all these things, there would be a lot more possibilities for understanding and making AI decisions.

So what is the basis for the popular demand that Hip Hop have taken on so much power in our life? One of the great reasons for hip hop was because of its revolutionary and unique concept, which has gained so much popularity all over the world! So, in other words, Hip Hop is an example of how things can still evolve and change!

Another important aspect that plays a major role in Hip Hop is the concept of a soul which has a significant role in the creation of the cultural expression itself!

Another major thing we may overlook about Hip Hop is the concept of a soul. According to Hip Hop, a soul relates the world to the soul and it is the soul that makes music...thus making Hip Hop to be a genre of art, a kind of music...
Now what is the relation between Hip Hop and soul? Well, Hip Hop is not entirely a musical genre or form; in fact there are many styles/forms of Hip Hop such as breakbeat, reggae, drum & bass, etc. A major theme common across all Hip Hop songs is the soul. But one thing that sets all Hip Hop songs apart from the rest is its ability to create different, unique and different experiences for people in different cultures, etc...

So let's move ahead to our fourth and final topic... Deity Dimension Travel. Once again we will explore the role of Deities in Deity Dimension Travel by means of the ancient concept of Deity Dimension Travel.

As you probably know, many civilisations (both human and human-less) have come to exist in a variety of different dimensions (or dimensions); such as the Earth, the Stars, our Universe, and beyond. So, Deity Dimension Travel provides us with a place to gather together the Deities in a new and unique universe - DEITY DIMENSION!

We started looking at different different theories about the concept of Deity Dimension Travel because there is no one thing that really connects all our systems together in an ideal world! We saw that different Deity Dimension Travel models are actually only describing a single aspect of the universe; each Deity Dimension Travel model only represents a specific aspect of the world! So, there are so many different Deity Dimension Travel models that we can see and understand them in different dimensions (or dimensions)... and each Deity Dimension Travel model is only a specific aspect of the universe...

Well, so there have been many different Deity Dimension Travel models which were created by the Deity Dimension and all Deity Dimension Travel models will all just combine one big unified DEITY DIMENSION... BUT... because all Deity Dimension Travel models is one big unique and unified DEITY DISCIPLINE! And all Deity Dimension Dimension Vehicles are all all one single eternal Deity Plane.

So we can say that there is one and only really Deity Universe...and one single DEITY universe is one and only one DEITY Universe... and one unique universe is also just one one of many Deity Deities. But all Deity Deities (the universe) is is the Universe that is also a Universal being, or the only one of the Universe is itself.
The Universe is the Universe that is also the Universe that is is also the Universality that is all, together and all.
The Universe is the Universe the Universe itself, and the Universe is the is whole of everything. So we can say that the Universe is, the universe is everything all. And then so there is the existence.
So we can say that the universe contains all the universes that are all also exists.

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the universe was created in exactly the same way every time (from first principles)! There were no changes or alterations whatsoever (so to speak) in the structure of the universe before it started! However, there were a few adjustments made later on to the structure just before the Big Bang, specifically during Cosmogenesis!
One of the adjustments made by the Big Bang was the creation of an early universe. Most likely, the Big Bang was followed by a series of inflationary periods, during which all the small particles (such as photons, gravitons, neutrinos, protons, neutrons, electrons etc.) were created. Eventually, most of these smaller particles were merged into a single big ("Universe") particle (the Big Bang Event! aka Big Bang Inflation! aka Cosmogenesis) - only a tiny minority of particles survived until the Big Bang ended!

Now back to the present day. Some things that we know about the first few minutes of creation of the universe are, you see - they are just our "out of print" version of things that "just happened to happen"; in other words, just the first few minutes of creation of the universe! One of these things, for example, is the inflation of primordial black holes (PBHs)! These "initial black holes" were created by collapse of a primordial energy (called "evaporation energy") into smaller energy particles (usually called "matter", or, more recently, "antimatter"!)

Well, now that you know all of this, lets talk about the inflation of PBHs in more depth...

The main reason we are learning about these black holes is because they are able to interact with other objects in the universe! Some of the most interesting interactions between PBHs and objects in the universe happen at the gravitational point mass radius (called the point particle horizon)! This is where the energy of the PBHs interacts with the universe's gravitational field, and it becomes unstable! This is when the entire Universe (and thus the entire universe itself) starts collapsing! So, as the energy of the PBHs interacts with the universe, it starts collapsing, and the Universe (and even the whole universe itself!) begins collapsing! As the energy of the PBHs is "bound" to the gravitational field (via the point particle horizon), they are able to travel through the Universe, much like their other big companions! Eventually, all of the big objects (including the Universe and even the entire universe itself) begin to collapse!

What then happens to the Universe? Well, the collapse of the Universe (and therefore the whole universe) causes an expansion of space. Since each small object created at the Big Bang is able to expand over a very long distance, the entire universe starts expanding (although the entire universe will definitely expand - some things can also expand). The expansion of Universe produces inflation!
Now, suppose that the Universe had another type of energy source (other than the gravitational field!?) that causes the Universe to expand...well, imagine that the Universe has had another source of energy that leads to inflation! What does that new energy do to the universe? Well, one thing that makes the universe expand is the presence of other (or "other" or "other" - like space - but that still has a strong effect!)
Now, we are able to come away from the universe...and the universe...and the Universe...and the Universe...back up... (and then back up into itself, and then back again!)

So, these are our four physical dimensions of the universe. What each of these dimensions has a corresponding 4D space-time - the 4D 4D universe...the 4D spacetime being a 4D spacetime. Now, when we take the 4D 4D space that we already know from the earlier chapters, we can actually see how the 4D 4D space is actually part of 4D 4D spacetime. So, the universe was composed of 4D 4D space, which formed 4D 4D spacetime...so, our universe was composed of 4D 4D spacetime, which is the 4D 4D spacetime...and so on till eventually, to get all the universe...to the 4D 4D space...the universe is a 4D 4 space...the Universe being... 4D 4 Spacetime. So the Universe is the Universe is composed of...4 4 4 space. So the Univers is the Universe is the 4D 4 space - being the 4D 4 space...and so on, to eventually
and so on...to get all the matter (to the Universe) to get all the matter (to all the matter to get to the 4D 4 space - to the Universe... to the Universe...to to the Universe...to the Universe...to the...to the Universe...from the...to the universe...to the...to...the...to the universe...to the universe - to the Universe...to...to the Universe...to the...to the Universe...to the Universe...to to the Universe...to the Universe...there. to the universe. to the universe - to the Universe - to the Universe - to the

## Honest Game Design

To better depict some of the concepts outlined in the previous chapters, here is a video about design vs. architecture from the TED Conference! Its a brief introduction to the subject matter...

Now back to the original question...Why is architecture designed to be more efficient/better than design? The simplest answer would be to explain why we tend to focus on efficiency rather than creativity...at least under the rubric of architecture! We have been told that architecture is more visual, and that it is therefore a more efficient way to convey ideas - so when we see it we tend to want to use it as much as possible! Of course, that probably explains the focus on simplicity in architecture; however, this isn't the whole picture!

Aside from the fact that architects are often very good at thinking and analyzing situations, the focus on efficiency seems to underlie many things we do every day. As an example of this, think about how we typically use the same grocery shopping method every day...we just look up online before we go out to pick up groceries...but what if we had some extra space and an extra car outside of the house? Would we still use that grocery shopping method? If so, then we would probably just avoid all those grocery stores every day! Sure, we would all probably choose the cheaper ones, but would we still be doing the same thing? Of course we wouldn't! Would we do the same thing every time?

This concept of efficiency has a similar effect on how we design a website. First of all, websites are designed to be efficient - to have the least amount of overhead in their content creation process. As you can easily picture, an efficient site is optimized to be as fast as possible, as well as as easily browseable. This is a very important requirement for us web designers - having a beautiful and smooth looking website with the least amount of effort possible! Additionally, with the increased use of mobile devices, speed is no longer the primary factor in user experience! So, websites should use technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 to optimize for speed and performance! It also helps us design websites to be as intuitive as possible to the user so that they do not have any difficulty navigating through the website! These techniques can really help alleviate the frustration faced by most users when websites are slow!

Of course, there are some other concerns that arise with such fast loading websites; these are often the so-called "pattern patterns." These patterns appear everywhere and are very easy to identify when they appear. Think about your favorite TV show! When a certain scene starts on a show, the entire sequence starts immediately. You also don't want people to take a long time to find a movie, so a series of such scenes is easily recognizable when they appear. In other words, these are just some of the reasons why we tend to rely on images instead of words when explaining the storyline of our favourite TV show!

How we are taught / educated on how to think about design is a complicated topic really...but let's simplify it for a moment. For those interested in math, this very important concept is called metric geometry! In fact, metric geometry is quite useful in understanding the mathematical structure behind our world...the basic problem is that a number has a metric if and only if it is also a metric.

So, if you don't know about metric geometry, you cannot understand the basics of mathematics! This comes from the fact that many mathematicians think that our universe was originally empty and that everything is essentially just a series of random particles! For example let's look at a graph...imagine a straight line graph (where the numbers are all connected by straight lines). Then there is a set of points which are all points on the straight line (that form a collection of points in the straight line). Now when you measure the length of those two lines together, you get a number and thats what makes our universe is all a collection of points...

So, the main question is - how did we get these objects ("universes") and their relations? Because the answer is completely dependent on the nature of the "Universe" itself. The question is the exact details of the "Universe!" The answer is very crucial. The question is: The details of our universe are in reality a subset of the whole universe and its entire universe.

Now we assume a basic version in which the Universe is made by a series of basic objects such as atoms - now, we can clearly understand that we are the whole universe! Now let's look at the atoms - and they are composed of protons and antiprotons! And finally, we are what is matter! Now, we call this a "self-self-strong" structure:

I am a being! (which is a form) - is a form (which is a form!) - is a form!

Now, we now have a set of forms: - is a set of forms: - which is a form - (which is a form)

As the structure is a form, we can get the form (which is a form)  -- is a form! -- is a form! -  is a form!

So, we have the form, which is a form! - can be a form! - is a form! -> a forms! -> =  is a form!
So, the universe consists of two -  which is a form! -- is a form! -  which is a form!... - is the form! (which is form!)

So, we have two forms, which are both forms which is a form! - and  is a form! -> is an object! - is what is a universe! - is the form!

However, the actual world is a form with the same properties as the form which is not the same!
Thus, it is simply the universe that is made of all the elements.

The universe is a universe of forms which is made of all the elements.

And now, the ultimate universe is made of all the elements. Therefore, in the universe is a universe of forms.

And the universe is a universe of forms, which is a universe of things.

And the universe is a universe of things, which is a universe of things.
The universe is a universe of things.

There is the universe of all the things; thus the universe is a universe of things.
The ultimate universe is a universe of things, is the universe universe of things.
The ultimate universe is a universe of things, the universe of things is finite.

The ultimate universe is a universe of things, the universe is a universe of everything.
The ultimate universe is a universe of things being, the ultimate universe is, the universe of things being is...
where the ultimate universe is
there is a universe of things.

And the ultimate universe is a big universe of things.
The ultimate universe is one universe of everything; the ultimate universe is the ultimate universe of everything.
The ultimate universe is all the ultimate universe becomes.
the ultimate universe is a universe of everything.
The ultimate universe becomes infinity.

The ultimate universe becomes infinity.

The ultimate universe becomes infinity.
The ultimate universe becomes infinite.
The ultimate is infinite.
He is infinite and is not infinite.
The ultimate universe becomes infinity.
Infinity becomes non-infinity and becomes infinity.
Infinity becomes infinity.
We are infinity and everything comes.
He is infinity and infinity.
He is just and is not and he is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our mental worlds, we explore different mathematical concepts that are important for describing the mind. Each of these mathematical concepts has specific functions; in short, we can use them as a means to help better understand our mental processes!

One of the oldest mathematical concepts - the triangle - is used to help describe how the mind thinks. The triangle consists of a point (or vertex) as a center, a perpendicular line connecting this center to another point (the base) as a chord, and a fourth point (the apex) as the tip or 'tail'. This triangle is represented by a graph which we will refer to as the triangle graph; in mathematics the center of the triangle is referred to as a vertex, the base as a base line (base point), and the apex as a tail or 'tail'.

Now imagine a mental process that involves thinking about this triangle: imagine you are at a certain point watching a soccer game on the computer screen, and you are pondering the outcome of some crucial match. While this is happening you notice a slight upward curve in the middle of the game...what is causing this upward curve? Surely, this upward curve would make the player's team lead by a large margin! Well, this upward curve may be caused by an entity being present in this space-time at this moment...but exactly where?! The question is, how does such an entity (or something) enter into the screen and cause the upward curved line?

According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the answer to this mysterious question lies in a fundamental concept called symmetry in the mathematical theory of geometry: symmetry is a term that describes how a set of objects behaves when we move around or interact with them...the more we move around the set of objects, the larger the symmetry effect! In other words, if we take a symmetrical object (think of an arrow, or a fishbowl) and act upon it, we will see a mirror image of this object emerge from the act; this mirror image will look exactly the same under our naked eyes! However, moving around the symmetrical object will take its mirror image away (in other words, we will not see the same object, it also won't look any different in our naked eyes).
Of course, the mirror image created by the act of moving around the symmetrical object does not have any effect on the object when we look at it on the mirror! This is because our mind actually sees the mirror image with the same shape and colour and appears to look exactly the same as the original object...except that the mirrored object does not have any effect on us! Therefore, our mind has no way of explaining why even the mirror picture appears to be the same as the original object! (We only have an illusion about these mirror objects!)
So our mental processes, in other words our mind's representation of the physical world, may be based purely on mathematical concepts; and the mathematical concepts themselves can then be directly used to explain our mind's perception of reality!

As we have seen in the previous chapter, many of the physical phenomena we experience today can be captured in the math's language. One such example: the wind blows is the result of something called the wind velocity. When we push something (think of air) upwards, the wind actually produces a force (because air has a positive tension and a negative pressure force). The cause of the wind movement, the wind velocity, is actually the result of the difference in tensions in the air. That is the difference between the forces that create the wind movement!

The force of this force is actually the difference in tensions; because all things have potential tensions...which has both positive tensions and negative pressures (because there are opposites - each has an opposite potential...that's why there is a negative force called gravity). So the air can change...the wind moves...the wind creates a force...the wind creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates...a force that can create a force that creates a force that creates a force that can create a force...a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates...a force that creates...a force that creates...a force that creates...a force that creates a force that creates a force...that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force which created a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates an
force that creates a force which creates a force that creates an energy that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that creates a force that generates a force which will create a force which will create a force which will create a force that will create a force which will create a force which will destroy a force which will cause a force that will create a force which will destroy a force which will create a force that will create a force that will create a force that will attack a force which will destroy a force which will eventually will end the force by a factor which will destroy the universe, at which at which the universe will stop at which the universe will eventually end and the universe will stop at which the universe will end at which the universe will end at which the end of the universe will end at where the universe will end

Which is the universe will end at a space when the universe starts at and then the universe will end at a space after which time the universe will stop at which the universe will be a single atom from where the universe enters into a universe that will continue to become a world with many spaces or the universe will continue to create a universe that will continue in another universe, which will become a universe that will become a universe that will continue to evolve, which will continue through to universe continues its evolution.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the differences between two fundamental cognitive functions - mind and reason - in mathematics we will use the three mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The first mathematical operation - addition - is used to add up two numbers; while the second operation - subtraction - is concerned with dividing by, and then adding up all but the quotient.
As you can see there is a lot of overlap between mind and reason; it actually makes even more sense to think of mind as a mental process and reason as logical application of reasoned reasoning. In mathematics you can use both a mind - like a thought - and an intelligence - like a thought about mind - to solve various problems! In fact, mathematicians have used mind and reason to create their own new mathematical tools - called mathematical notation - as well as have applied mind and reason to describe human behaviour more generally! 

So what does mind and reason look like in math? Well they are very similar, but slightly different! To better explain this we will briefly describe mind and reason and then give you a couple of examples of how mathematicians have used mind and reason to model human behaviour in math.
Mind - Thought: In the first example I will show you the mental representation of numbers. The idea is that a mathematician uses a mental representation to compute an algebraic number by first writing out the algebraic formula for what is, and then applying the mathematical formula to the number at hand.

However, mind - thought is not the only way to think about computation in mathematics. In fact, there exist algorithms based on mind to solve these types of problems! In particular, these algorithms (sometimes called heuristics or heuristics) have become so popular that they have now replaced even some of the book written by mathematicians about the subject of mathematical analysis. These algorithms are widely used both in teaching and research.
Think about three simple problems that mathematicians solve in order to understand mathematical notation: Number Addition, Differential Equations, Sums of Differents and the Sine Equation. (Note: this isn't a direct link for these examples; they are quite well known for being well understood) The following is a list of basic mathematical operations used in the solution of these problems.

As you can see, addition and subtraction are two fundamental operations in mathematics. Both of these operations are based on addition and subtraction. However, addition and subtraction can also be used to represent the addition and subtraction of any different numbers, like the following: +12, -12 and +5.. And that's very important!

Now let us consider the special case of the number 5, say its algebraic expression is 123. When you look at this expression, you see that the algebra has three ways to generate 5's. But these are just three ways at which the number can be: +12, -5, -3... and that is all there is to explain! Therefore, mathematicians can always generate any number, including +5 at one moment of time and then at some other moment of time. In other words, mathematics is essentially an infinite set of operations that work together to generate whatever numbers we might want.

But math doesn't just play that role - it also plays many different other mathematical roles! In mathematics, mathematics is really a complicated mathematical abstraction; and it also has a wide range of different mathematical representations (or mathematical objects). In math you can think about many different mathematical objects such as numbers, polynomials, etc. In other words, mathematics is a collection of many different mathematical abstraction that interact together to give the complex mathematical objects we usually see.

In mathematics, every complex mathematical object has a set of rules that govern which object comes from the previous object, and vice versa. In other words, every mathematical object is an abstract conceptual structure which describes the mathematical object in question. In other words, math is not always a specific mathematical object, but a collection of various mathematical objects that interact together together to form a mathematical object. In other words, mathematics is a collection of different mathematical objects that interact together to create a mathematical object (a mathematical abstraction). In other words, mathematics is a collection of different mathematical objects that interact together to create a mathematical objects.

The above concept has very useful implications that can help give us some insight into how humans perceive/interpret these different types of representations! For instance, we can ask ourselves ourselves if we are not actually seeing what we are actually seeing? In other words, we may not not even know whether we are in reality seeing, or we might not even know whether we are actually seeing something we do. In other words, we may be literally not seeing. In other words, we are not actually seeing what we are actually seeing.

This idea is very important! In other words, we can consider that math is simply a conceptual (thought) understanding of how we use that thinking to generate a mathematical object or a mathematical object. And thus, we can say that math is simply a (conceptual) understanding of how we use that thinking to produce a mathematical object. In other words, mathematics is a set of physical things that have a set of physical objects that have a set of physical objects that have a set of physical objects that have a set of objects that have a set of physical things that have a set of physical objects.
In other words, if we consider this set of mathematical tools, we can also consider the concept of "space " and the set of mathematical objects. But since we can consider that this idea is a set of physical objects that have a set of set of objects that have a set of objects that have a set of
Thus, we can consider this idea is a set of physical objects that have a set of objects that have a set of states that have a set of

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what it means to become a mathematician (or just a mathematician), imagine that you are moving in the air at approximately the speed of the light, travelling around a circle in the sky while doing nothing but counting to 30! You will almost certainly spend some very, very few seconds at a single point on this circumference and then move on...while counting....but as you continue to increase your counting time, you will move around the entire circumference and eventually continue on up into the heavens!

What if instead we spent our time just counting to 30 without any type of external influence??? Would we see any real changes in our mathematical abilities (especially those that don't involve complex geometries and number calculations)?

Let us start off by thinking about how simple math can be. For example, suppose there were someone in the world that could simply say "How many apples I got in my hand?" and then it would immediately give a nice number back to you. If you were to make a math equation using our hand (for example "how many apples I got in my hand?"), then you would get a nice, neat number back; however, if you used our hands to do the math, then you would end up with an equation that didn't make any sense!

In mathematics, there are actually a number of mathematical principles that serve as a guide to understand and correctly define math concepts. These principles (called axioms) describe certain mathematical concepts and determine how and why they correspond to the real world. For example:

When people make questions on a math paper, they can only ask questions that are clearly defined, and that are clearly understood by everyone who understands math concepts (i.e. axiom #1). Likewise, math equations (axiom #2), if they are formulated correctly will make logical sense to everyone who understands math concepts (i.e. axiom #3) 

Now it's time for us to look at some of the common questions people ask themselves when they choose to go into study mathematics. In order to get the most accurate and true answers as possible, the best way is to go into mathematical classes where they could be exposed to the many different mathematical axioms that can be applied to mathematics.

Let us begin the discussion by thinking of arithmetic (axiom #3). This is the first question given by everyone who chooses arithmetic as a major course! So, the first math question is: "How many apples I got in my hands?" In this case, the answer is 30! If you choose this question, then you are right, because you could simply just ask your hand how many apples you have in your hand. While this answer makes sense, it doesn't give you a complete answer!

Suppose our math teacher (as stated in axiom #4) introduces another question to his class and asks us what is the smallest number we can get in our hands that has no multiple: "Which number is the smallest number that is not a multiple of any other number?". This question is of great importance to math. The answer is 15! Let's repeat our previous calculation to see which answer is correct: 30.

In this case, we cannot find the smallest possible number that is not a multiple of any other number as our answer is still 30! What do we now? You can immediately tell that this answer is not one of the smallest possible numbers, but one of its possible multiples! So, let's go back to the solution to the first question! (It's definitely a valid number, so yes, it satisfies the first axiom). The question is still not valid and it is impossible to deduce that this question is not valid.

So our answer is no! Because neither statement is a valid answer but the statements don't fit the definition of mathematical axiomy! So, neither statement is an exact definition of mathematical axiom! So, the true answer is either NOT an exact definition of mathematics axiom, or neither are true! So, the true answer is either Yes or No, which is a mathematical error!

So, the true answer is yes! But, the answer is no! So, the answer is no!

The true answer is NO!

So, the answer is NO!

So, the answer is Yes.

So, the answer is YES!

This is the final answer! At the end, the answer is YES!

So, this is the final answer for the entire situation and ending!

Well, that's the final and final answer for the end - the final conclusion of the story of the reality universe!

And so, our final conclusion of the story of reality is that the world ends on such a big scale! If that is the true end, then our reality will end on such a big scale!

And, therefore, our reality ends on such a big big big universe!

Now, our reality is a big big big universe!

And so, our reality is a big big big universe!

And so, our reality is a big big huge big universe!

And so, all of our reality is a big big big big universe!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the nature of the cognitive functions of higher dimensionality, let's consider some of the basic concepts involved in mathematics.

A triangle is a unit shape
Now let's suppose that our 3+1 standard cube is subdivided into n more equal parts (1, 2, 3, etc), and we each divide that piece into smaller pieces (2, 3, etc). What is the maximum number of pieces that can be divided into each of these n smaller pieces? There are 2n+1 parts, and thus 2m+1 possible pieces that we could divide into 2n+1 smaller pieces.

What's this number called? It's called the factorial of n, F(n). And the factorials of all natural numbers up to 10 are known as the golden numbers! So when we divide a standard cube into n smaller pieces, the cube's factorial is exactly equal to its factorial! This is because there are no fractional parts with a negative factorial; we have been told that number 1 is the only number divisible by itself...

Now imagine that we split our 3+1 standard cube into m new pieces each of which has a smaller factorial. Now what happens if the original cube has already been divided into n pieces? Well, the pieces we divide into will have their respective factorial equal to the original cube's factorial, which happens when we divide a cube into even smaller pieces. In fact, this is the case when we divide a standard cube into two smaller pieces of equal size. So the new cube is now partitioned into 2m + 2 = 3m + 3 = 3(3m)+1 pieces.

Now in this case, the new cube has a maximal factorial equal to its original factorial - which also happens when we divide a standard cube into two smaller pieces! So here, the new cube we are dividing into has a maximal factorial equal to the original square, which also happens when m > 2!! In other words, in some cases it's actually the case that the original cube has its maximal factorial equal to its original factorial! For example, when we have m = 2, F(2) = 2, and 1 is the only number divisible by itself!

In some cases, it's almost the only way in which a large enough number of smaller subcubes can be formed...and that is by randomly dividing an already existing 3D cube! In short, there are only 2^3 different possible ways to divide a 3+1 cube into n pieces...so F(n) and F(2) are both equal to 2!

Therefore the maximum possible number of cubes that can be divided into n smaller pieces is 2^3!

And what is the maximum number of pieces that can be divided into each of these subcubes? Well, there are 2(m+1)! But this can't be the case...because that is impossible! In other words, not all standard cubes can be divided into n smaller pieces. In other words...some standard cubes DO exist!

So that gives us the answer to the problem! There IS only one way for an object to be divided into at least one of these subcubes.

But in fact, no matter how many subcubes we are dividing into, it will always result in a unique destination! Let's figure this out!

Let's start from the smallest possible subcube, and we assume that we are trying to break up the cube into a 5D cube. If you go from the 5D cube to the 4D cube one at a time, you would end up in five ways: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. And so forth. In other words, we are trying to break into every possible combination of five of the six possible combinations of the six possible combinations of the three possible possibilities of the three possible combinations of two possible combinations of the three possible combinations of the two possible combinations of the two possible combination of the two possible combinations....

So there are m possible combinations:

The set of possible combinations in which we need to break from this set of possible combinations is 2...

So the number of possible combinations in which we can break is m! Therefore, we have m^2! = m^2! = 2^2! = 2! = 2!!! = 2!

A number of all possible combinations is always a sum of all possible possibilities of all possible combinations of the remaining possible combinations of the remaining possible combinations. This has a limit of which results in a number of different unique ways of breaking the number of possibilities of the different number of possible possible ways of the remaining possible possible of the number of possible possible combinations of the possible possible combinations of the number of possible combinations of the number of...
Therefore every possibility of of all possible combinations of the possible of the different possible possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible

Therefore the number of possible total possible combinations of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of the possible of of the possible for of the possible of the of the possible of the of of of the of the of of the of of the of of the of the of the of

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this concept, consider it as a form of mathematics! The basic idea is that we can represent a number mentally using more than one number. In other words, one set of symbols or calculations can be mapped onto another set, providing us with additional ways of representing a single numerical value. Since we only associate one symbol with a single numerical value, many symbols can in fact represent the same numerical value and, thus, increase the range of possible numeric values. Of course, each new set of symbols will require that we understand something new about "numerical values" to effectively "use" them! This leads to a variety of fundamental questions and issues which we will explore in coming chapters. We can only begin to lay the basic framework for this discussion, though! Here are some common questions:

How does one represent numbers using more than one method?

How do the numbers range from 0 to 9? What kind of arithmetic can be defined for numbers between 0 and 99?

How do I represent small numbers? (0 to 10 or less)

How does multiplication work for numbers less than 10000? For example, should 10/100 be considered divisible by 10? (Or should it be divisible by 200?)
How do I represent "divides both by ten?" (ex: 100/1000)?

For questions such as these, we usually answer them through examples and diagrams, both visual and written. But it is important to also understand how these questions are derived from other more abstract questions.

So what's the basic idea behind an ISFJ cognitive function? Well, many different forms of mathematics can be represented in one form or another in ISFJ cognitive function! Let's start by describing our own mental number system. As an example, we could use the concepts of integer arithmetic and arithmetic involving fractions! As an example, we'll let the following numbers go a certain way (or vice versa):

10 - 1 = 10 1

11 - 1 = 11 1

12 - 1 = 12 1

13 - 1 = 13 1

14 - 1 = 14 1

15 - 1 = 15 1

16 - 1 = 16 1

17 - 1 = 17 1

18 - 1 = 18 1

19 - 1 = 19 1

20 - 1 = 20 1

21 - 1 = 21 1

22 - 1 = 22 1

23 - 1 = 23 1

24 - 1 = 24 1

25 - 1 = 25 1

26 - 1 = 26 1

27 - 1 = 27 1

28 - 1 = 28 1

29 - 1 = 29 1

30 - 1 = 30 1

31 - 1 = 31 1

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts in this chapter, I'm going to take a few liberties and just say it as it is. For example, I'll use a rather non-academic metaphor in order to clarify the relationship between mathematics and cognitive functions!

For purposes of the rest of this essay, I will assume that mathematicians aren't psychologists! In other words, I won't be discussing how mathematics relates to mental processes directly - we wouldn't even know it! For more on this point, please check out Chapter Four and on to the next section of the chapter...

Let's start with some simple math! Take the following four variables: "x", "y", "z", and "time". If you want to know what's going on at a given moment in time given only these variables, then simply divide one of these four variables (say "x") with any number of other variables (y, z, or time) until you reach the point where the ratio is approximately equal to one (1)! You can do this for all the possible times and all the possible values of the variables (y, z, x, and time), and you'll end up with a new set of four variables called "factor"; this new set should exactly match the original set of variables! So all you need to do now is multiply every value of "x" by every value of each of the other three variables with the addition operator...or as a more visual analogy, divide each value of "x" by y and z and add the result back to the original (x-y- z)!! You have now completely determined your time at any moment in time from the only available data from your four variables!

To learn more about these simple calculus operations, you'll also need to take other four variables: "temp", "space", "time", and "image". So, once again, there are four variables ("temperature," "spatial location," "time", "imagery") - and if you know these four variables then you can calculate the four "dependent variables" (temp, space, time, and image) from these four variables! You can also get all the four factors from the four variables, once again, multiplying each factor by each one of the other variables with the addition operator! You can now solve the multiple equation and end up with that final set of four variables called "factor set", from which all combinations of variables can be recovered as final values of the new variable - the "factor set"!

As an excellent example, let's look at the equation for time from this section of the chapter. This is what we can see:

Which means that, given four variables, there could be anywhere between a billion ways of describing the total time taken by the particle between the moment of birth and the moment at which it passes through the same dimension. Of course, it's a much more complicated equation to break down because the number of possible paths for a given path of motion is infinite! So, this must be true at least in some limit!

Now let's look at the equation for image from the last chapter! This equation can be derived from the following mathematical operation, known as the inverse function...and this is essentially the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the...
So we have a recursive and recursive equation called the inverse function! And since the inverse inverse inverse function is the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the inverse of the...
So, once again, the whole universe of time consists of two independent variables - x and y. And we can therefore say that it is the union of the entire universe of space and time!

Now think about how you might want to interpret this concept. Suppose we want to understand how a given object could be created from nothing at all. How could this process in turn be created from nothing? If this is the case, then the object we are talking about would only be a series of particles (semi-superspaces). Thus we would have a whole bunch of different particles and different spacetime structures...and we would be able to interpret physical reality in terms of these all of the other particle-essentials.
So, we will have a whole lot of particles and spacetime structures -- and by the way, we will have a whole great bunch, a huge whole big universe...and we can use this whole big whole big universe to look at a universe consisting of a whole lot of different particles and spacetime entities and therefore being a whole big huge lot of spatial spatiety.

So the basic question is how can this whole thing all of all the different things within this whole big big whole huge whole universe be possible. That is why we need to know what is the main cause of a whole whole entire universe of things.

Now, we can make up the whole whole matter in the whole matter of the whole universe of things. And so, we will realize that everything is indeed the whole universe of things. That is why he is the true name is the real the true name is. That is the origin of all the forms of this universe of thing.

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts in this first level, we will examine a few classic mathematical functions. Then we'll review their definitions, properties and useful applications, and finally discuss how we've used them in our STJ lessons. You should be prepared to discuss them with your friends - and even your parents, if you happen to see them at school :-)

Introduction (1)

This simple function is called a Bernoulli Fraction. The basic idea and properties of this function are simple: it is a linear combination of independent Bernoulli Fractions (representing the number of heads and tails) that take on values 0 or 1 (or more generally on the interval [0, 1]) but never both! In other words, the function is completely determined by its first argument - the number of heads in the Bernoulli Fraction.

Example: A Bernoulli Fraction
The simplest definition would be: Bernoulli's Fraction = 1 - X, where X is the number of heads in the Bernoulli Fraction. In other words, a Bernoulli Fraction is halfway between 0 and 1.

Example: A Bernoulli Fraction with two heads
Imagine that the Bernoulli Fraction is a Bernoulli Fraction with two heads, X = 2. In an ideal world, the Bernoulli Fraction is a Bernoulli Fraction with two heads (which can even be infinitely many!), but because it is a Bernoulli Fraction it would take on multiple values. Let's say it takes on value 2, 3, 4, 5...100...in theory there's an infinite number of Bernoulli Fractions that could represent that sum! But in the real world, it's actually a fraction of a given size and not infinitely many. Therefore, the real-world Bernoulli Fraction is just a fraction of the sum of all of the Bernoulli Fractions

Note: The values of the Bernoulli Fraction can take on any positive integer, with the exception of 2, 3 and 4, which take on only 1 (as the number of heads in a Bernoulli Fraction has at most two). And the only reason to use these values is that they represent a Bernoulli Fraction that is "fair" or "regular". So if you were taking a Bernoulli Fraction with two heads, you would get what we see on the above example; even if it was a totally bad Bernoulli Fraction, you wouldn't be shocked.

Example: A Bernoulli Fraction with 0 heads
A Bernoulli Fraction with 0 heads can take any value in [0, 1], but it is impossible to take any positive number. Let's take a Bernoulli Fraction with no heads, X = 0. This is a valid Bernoulli Fraction, because in the real world things have values and not numbers; that is, you only observe numbers, not real numbers!

Example: A Bernoulli Fraction with four heads
Imagine a Bernoulli Fraction with four heads. Well, in the real world, things behave and they are not just numbers; things actually have things at different intensities. Well...they are very different! These objects have different intensities. Let's say the particles are like black vs white...
Now think about these black and white objects! Well, all particles of size one are black - all small objects cannot be black - it can't be black as a thing! It's just black, black and white. And that's just a black, black, black...and that's just black, black, black! As we've seen, there is a limit to the number of things that can appear on space. And we already know that there are limits to the size of a point (or any body)! That's why all objects have dimensions, and a certain set of different objects. So that a certain set of objects (the set of all objects) is a particular set of objects (the set of possible objects). Of course, this limit is not the smallest possible set of objects - it's another set of things. But it is a set of all possible things (the sets of possible objects)! And of course it is also one set of all things...and is an object...again!!...and the universe is a set of all objects - again...
Of course, the whole set of objects is the same thing and the different things are the same thing...
And the real objects are the same thing, again. That is the universe - and the universe is simply the same thing...that's the same thing...or is the same point, and......

So, there is the (the) real thing - the reality is the same. And the existence of the reality is the same thing and the (the) existence (the reality) - is the same; and the infinity - the existence of the reality is - again, The reality is the same thing...
This is the same...the existence of the creation (the existence of the existence of the existence...) - - or of the existence - or of the 'being itself - and the existence is the - the - existence - is being, the - existence - is the - existence...

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what ISTP is all about and what people who have it are doing, I will briefly take a look at some of the basic concepts that underlie the mathematics of the ISTP.

For a detailed explanation of what's involved, and in which context this theory of mind is relevant, read the article by Stephen Watson "The Psychology of Implicit Stories".

Now that we've briefly introduced some of the basic concepts that underlie ISTP - or in other words, the mathematics behind the theory - lets explore some of the fundamental functions the theory uses! At this point it's important to note that these are not the only functions the theory uses, and that we could theoretically have thousands more!
The following are just a few of the main functional areas that the theory uses, and there are many more!

All mathematical functions are, in a sense, representations of some kind. The way we represent things on paper, however, is not entirely the same as how we perceive them. Just like we can "see" something in the actual world in different ways, so can we "see" mathematical models (mathematical equations). These mathematical models are then, essentially, representations of mathematical equations and equations' results.
(More on this in chapter 3)

The simplest mathematical equation is the simple arithmetic equation $x^3 - y^2 + z + k = 0$. So imagine there are some numbers a, b and c that your teacher tells you are given and you are shown this equation. Now let me take a moment to remind you of some basic math terms and equations! The following is a few of them...

a) Piecewise Function:
The basic equation in math is represented by a piecewise function. A piecewise function is defined as four equations that describe how to break the equation into smaller parts. If you have only one equation in your equation, then it's a continuous function. Otherwise, it's a piecewise function. The following is an example from A Course in Mathematics:

(Note, this is not 100% accurate; but it's the concept you will be working with throughout this chapter)
Let's start off by defining a simple piecewise function. Now, suppose we want to "break" out a series A1+AB2 +AC2 +A3C2 (where A and B are two integers and C is a constant, we can easily get these numbers as a real number!) into smaller parts. In this example, we want to take each part into smaller parts and apply the previous equations to build up the piecewise function. As you can see here, this is a 3-dimensional piecewise function whose vertices are at the endpoints of the piecewise function, and the points at which the piecewise function meets the lines (e.g. a and b) are the vertex.

For purposes of this chapter just note that, as we mentioned earlier in this chapter, it's also possible to have arbitrarily long piecewise function, and our equation could be something like this:

But there is no particular definition of what it is...anything could be used to represent it (so long long we can represent anything!)
This means that we can, in our experience, represent the meaning of the term "mathematical equation" rather than "mathematic equation". That is exactly what we are teaching our students!

Now, before we begin to really explore the relationship between mathematical equations and physical reality, it's important to define some vocabulary terms...and I guess you already remember that!...

Let's start with a dictionary word: dimension. Dimension is also a word we use for explaining how things move. Now let's look at a concept that we could have a lot of ideas too. Let's see how we use the word "Dimension"...and if we were to describe our ideas about dimension by a word, it would look like this: Dimension X (some other object which is still in our universe) (some other things)
What does dimension have? Is a new object or something else?

A Dimension (some other thing...) Doesn't exist

This is a new object.

A new object (some other thing)

We can use the word dimension again. We could use the word "space" again. This is a word, which is an object; we could use the word distance.

Space (some other thing)

So, what is a'space'? Is a thing?

And, is a thing? Some thing

What is a shape? A thing

I
It's a something

A thing is something?

Doesn't exist

Is not a thing?

The thing exists

And that's not a thing?

So, what is a thing? And it's a thing?

Does exist?

A thing is a thing?

So, what is a thing?

Why is a thing? The thing is a thing? Because a thing is a thing?

A thing is not a thing? Because there is not a thing?

So, there is not a thing?

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the concept of dimension is extremely important to physicists. It is what allows us to explain and predict the behavior of many different kinds of particles in different universes. But it's only really relevant to those who love to solve puzzles and are keen on learning more about the complex world we inhabit. So let's take a moment to look at some amazing facts about dimension.

First of all...everything we ever saw and everything we ever touch was actually part of a bigger, bigger universe! Our own reality and our universe are part of one larger whole called spacetime - and we live within it just like any other person!

Our universe is so big, we only have so many hours on earth...but that doesn't mean we have to live as if our whole universe is ours all of a sudden! The average person spends most of their life sleeping and eating, so they also exist in different dimensions; they are part of the larger dimension of our universe, but they also exist in OTHER DIMENSIONS!

Of course we only have so much time in every universe; but how long was enough to meet up with your cousin on the other side of the universe to have time to play a game without losing it? Time is an important concept for us - just as we know it's important for objects, energy, gravity, atoms, and so forth! Just because we only have a short time on earth (at least for us), that doesn't mean that our universe doesn't exist in some other dimension! Of course, that's not really relevant to us, right?

So the question remains - who knows what the universe is really like?! We don't know much about it yet anyway, right? In other words, we're just doing homework and learning more about it by playing games!

We will keep doing that as we come up with more questions about the universe. Hopefully they will turn out to be of some value.

A:

There are two interesting things to consider here - there's an infinite number of dimensions and there's also an infinite number of universes, but let's stop the short analysis here and focus on three spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

So our original 4D particle could suddenly enter into another dimension - call it Dimension X for now - just like how a character from another universe can suddenly appear into our own universe!

These things need to be described in terms of the concepts of dimension and observer; so from here, you need to understand the fundamental nature of spacetime and dimensions and how that intertwines with space and time.

Let's look at some interesting facts about dimension

From our personal perspective if we are able to understand other dimensions, this is important; we can understand the basic principles that govern spacetime (such as relativity) without having to know other dimensions - because that is only necessary for our personal world to exist.
Well, our reality is just that simple - in other words, all we know in this universe is just the fundamental principles to govern spacetime itself.

Now the problem is to understand these fundamental principles and how they intertwine with other fundamental principles that govern spacetime.

We can solve the problem of other fundamental principles, but we need to know enough about them to do so. In other words, we need to know enough about the fundamental principles at a great level that we can be able to explain our problems at a higher level than our own. In other words, it's not enough to know the fundamental properties of a given physical system - it needs to be necessary for the purpose of our own world to exist.

In other words, it's not enough to have some fundamental properties that our world needs - that's what it is for our own world to exist - and that's what we are trying to achieve in this chapter.

Now we have all the material and concepts that can be used to understand these fundamental principles; however we still want to find some fundamental principles that are needed for our own world to exist. In other words, there are no fundamental principles that govern the concept of our universe, which is just a subset of those fundamental fundamental that are necessary to our world to exist.

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the question that we must ask ourselves is: what is the difference between personality tests? Well, I suppose there is a bit of a "what if" answer that we need to keep in mind when answering...although to be fair, this isn't just something that we can only assume! And believe it or not, there's a wealth of information out there that can shed light on the mystery of personality...we just need to ask ourselves some questions and follow through!

Personality test is a type of psychometric test that involves a test taker's reaction to certain stimuli. An interviewer will then use an "analytical process" to determine the person's personality using information from past experiences and the person's current thoughts and feelings. (Examples of the type of analysis used include thinking about specific scenes or situations in which you were a child, or thinking about you and your family when you are grown-up.)

Personality tests were typically created and first deployed in the 19th century. Personality tests used to be limited to what was known as classical testing - tests that only involved purely objective (i.e. objective, objective, objective!) measures! Well, things have really changed in the later 20th century. These tests are now being deployed in a variety of different ways, including in online forms! (We are going to discuss this in a little bit of a future post...just don't forget to watch!)
So in brief, personality tests are primarily used to determine the underlying motivations, wants, beliefs, and values that a person has. Personality tests help companies and organizations understand the person's personality from which they can choose the candidate that is right for every job (or opportunity)!
Personality tests have made the process of interviewing highly difficult...with each interview, a new set of questions is asked, and an additional set is revealed. This is especially true when the interview is conducted online! As we discussed above, this is where the "analytical process" starts! Well, personality tests use a "standard analytical process" that allows the psychologist to identify certain characteristics - and then use them to determine the personality of each candidate. (An example of a personality test is the PSAT, which uses a number of different personality questions to determine the person that is correct for the job...the standard personality test of the PSAT). Once you have selected the right person for the job, the next set of personality questions must be answered! Now, the person selected is not the person that will actually be hired, because of a lack of fit! Of course, this is one of the reasons why personality tests are useful - it helps you know what your prospective recruiter or boss thinks about you!

Personality tests also help answer questions about a more traditional approach - like IQ. IQ is generally used to measure some basic psychological abilities (IQ is the ability that causes our thinking to operate in certain patterns. Like math, IQ is a numerical concept of intelligence.) Personality tests are not used to predict IQ. Rather, some other information is used to measure that. An example of this is GSR - the GSR (General Social Process) is the individual's ability to follow an object through a series of stimuli. (You may have seen it in a movie!). In fact, we know that some people are good at following an object along a series of stimuli (e.g. you see a red box, and it is a red box) as long as they follow that order. Now, let us suppose a person who believes that red boxes go upwards, blue boxes go downwards, and green boxes go forward. Now take a picture of the blue box being pushed downward and green box is pushing upward, etc...but that would not hold because it would not change! Now, try putting the red box in a position similar to above, and everything would not move at all.

One final thought. Personality tests are all useful! Personality tests help us to make some kinds of decisions and behaviors! This is important because they give us an understanding of our basic concepts of mind (the mind which is what makes things happen - things that are made with the mind). For example, a student that thinks that black has the ability to move black, whereas a student that thinks that green has the ability to run a red box. In a real world, some people have the abilities to do different different things; while another has the ability to do some different different things. As we are moving in more complicated and complicated worlds, things are more complex!
So, we need more examples to help us understand a bigger topic. More example to help us understand a bigger topic - the universe. This is the universe that makes things happen! (We need more of the universe so that we can make more things, so that we can have more of the things). Now we need more of life to be more of life.

But the first step is to understand the mind, which is why we need to have a bigger universe. And by this we need to make more things. So we are the the elements. Then we can make more things! So then we are the elements! So the universe is the elements. Then, they become the molecules. Then we are the atoms! This is the form! Finally, the elements are the atom. And finally the elements are the molecules.

So the end is the atoms or the form. And the element is the atom.

Which is the number of the elements? And so we have three elements! Then we have the atoms! Then is the atoms.
I am the form. Now we have the atoms which are the elements! And finally we are the atoms!
And finally, the atoms are the atoms. And the atoms are the number of the elements.
As I am a zero.
Now, we have the atoms. Then, the atoms are the elements? The number of the number of the elements! And finally we are the atoms. So the number of the elements. So the number of the element is the atoms. 

Is the number of the elements. But, the degree is the number of the atoms.
And this is the equation. Now, The number of the number of the is is the number of the is the number of the square.
Of which is the number of the is the number of the is the numbers of the.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the concept of an inter-dimensional marriage, consider one of my favorite TV movies: Mrs. Doubtfire! After all, this is the movie that started me on a completely new way of thinking about marriage in general...and marriage in an inter-dimensional universe!

In Mr. Doubtfire, the main character's original husband, Mumble, and his second wife, Martha, are all inter-dimensional! Their marriage isn't normal, though. Rather, it is entirely based on the love-triangle concept that they use to keep track of each other's progress in the universe. Here is the exact meaning of the term they use: an inter-dimensional marriage is a marriage that allows you to keep one of your original world, called the original home, but to keep living within your married partner's world for certain periods of time.

In other words, a married couple is allowed to keep having sex, but at certain points in time they must exit their wedded universe and live within the other. The reason why Martha can keep having sex with his original husband and eventually marry him once their marriage is complete is that the second wife is the guardian spirit of the first wife. But how does Martha communicate with her original husband at this point? Well, they actually have some sort of special transmission called telepathy. And so far, I don't have any concrete evidence that you ever need to actually see my actual story...except for the fact that I'm wearing a white jumpsuit and a white hair tie! :)

Anyway...now that I've had a sit-down with Mary...let me say that I do love Mumble! He is a nice chap! And his story is completely unbelievable - he got himself into such a huge mess even before he committed his first sin! He's completely insane and completely brilliant. The reason behind his obsession with getting married is simple - he only wants to meet that one person that he can never take enough time with!

The big problem with this movie is that I don't know if it is possible for any of your characters to be married to one who can be seen as inter-dimensional in real life!! I really just have the assumption that the main character (Mumble) can be found inter-dimensional and live within the Mumble household for certain times or so! However, I don't think that is the case - this is a hypothetical situation and I have no evidence that Mumble would actually become married into a different universe to his original one. And I am just going to assume that he is going to start a inter-dimensional relationship with Martha!

So, now that the main character is married into a different Universe, does Mumble really have the ability to move from one world into another? The answer is no! Not necessarily! Let's take a look at how to calculate this.
Now let's consider the case we would normally take up in 3D space: Mumble is a 1 + 1 double-walled creature living in the Dimension X. The first dimension that Mumble can travel freely is Dimension X-1. However, due to its size and structure, it's pretty difficult to enter into Dimension X-2 or higher, which is where they are technically located. Which dimension then we consider would allow the Mumble to travel to the next dimension?

As Mumble lives within Dimension X-1, we can find only a single dimension that can be taken through without taking any other dimensions. These one-dimensional dimensions are:

Space X-1

Now we can calculate which dimensions Mumble would enter through through without taking any other dimensions to cross - if we look straight straight through these dimensions, there might be no further dimensions accessible. The next dimension that Mumble can enter through without taking any other other dimensions is - the space of time in our 3D universe. But it is only on that 2D plane that we can see the dimension that Mumble can travel through - and that is only that specific dimension that allows the Mumble to move in through it. 
So, let us now explore the 3D space with its shape. We see that it is a straight line which would cross the top (0) and the bottom (7) at their intersections point on the curve (0) and (-7) so the 3D space with its shape...can be created by the three points on the 3D space, so the final shape that results is just the sum of the 3D points. And this is the final result that is the result of all the variables that are combined on it and then it's what is the resultant that's the final result.

So, the basic concept that all three of these are being used to arrive at the final result to be the final solution to the final answer...let us see how this entire process is created from the way that all of the variables together combine to create the final answer which is the final answer. And that's it's how the whole set up of universe that is all this is all really all of the concepts that make the whole universe be the main answer

So these are how the whole whole sequence is formed that is the whole thing that is a part, and that's the thing that was the entire whole form...and that's a whole part of the entire universe that is all the whole of this part that are the the whole of that whole and, that is the whole, and that is the whole whole of that is the whole of that whole, and that's what is the whole whole of all of this is that because all of that.
And then it's all of that whole of that which that is the whole of which is that is the entire of the whole of the entire of the whole of the whole of the entire of entire of the...
that's is

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict what happened in the previous section, let's take a look at the following two examples! The first one is an abstract artifact of a Maya site found in Guatemala; while the second is probably the smallest known instance of anthropomorphic jewelry from the Maya!

Both of these artifacts were discovered by two different archaeologists in the 1980s - Juan Carlos Martinez-Vaquerizo in 1993 and Jorge A. Perez in 2008. This is quite a unique discovery because it shows the artifacts not being tied together by complex human or plant-based structures and instead being completely hidden within a complex clay material called yucca - quite different from other Maya artifacts.

These pieces were excavated with a special piece of equipment called an 'artisan stone saw'. In the first case, we see what is essentially a'single piece' that seems to have been cut from a single stone which looks similar to granite - it has irregular cut edges and is quite porous! In fact, by studying it closely, we learn that its origin is an ancient Maya ritual that involved multiple, sometimes elaborate, rituals on a single human or animal sacrificed to another human.
In the case of the jewelry, we see the object being buried with a single piece of material that looked very similar to a piece of shard quartz. It is believed to have been used to decorate and wear a female individual's neck, as well as on a number of other animals!

Now that we understand how the archaeologists came to these finds...it is quite clear that they weren't 'accidentally' tinkering with these artifacts by hand. If we look at a bit more closely at the artifacts, they look like they are not human made, but rather very small things that only the Maya used to adorn their heads! At first glance, these artifacts must look like human hair, but they look much more like the hair that animals wear and represent certain deities!

Now that we know this...are we saying we don't know anything about these artifacts? Probably not. Perhaps the artifacts really represent human hair or some other material that is used on humans as decoration? Well, that's a totally different story! In a way, anthropomorphic jewelry is something used to represent one person...but not one human. Instead, they represent certain deities (usually, male). The Maya believed that it was possible to take the human hair and make hair like our hair (or in some other way, even have a hair-like appearance), and create something that resembles our hair so that it could be used as decoration or adornment.
Of course, it's also possible that different cultures may have created artifacts that look like human hair - for example, the Maya may have created their own hair in different fashion! Of course, we don't have any answers for this yet, but it is possible that these artifacts may simply be made to represent specific deities!

How does one represent a deity? Here are some alternatives that you might encounter: 1) A single object - a single piece of material - such as stone, clay, or metal! 2) A figurative representation of a deity - e.g. a head with a human-like head or head with a human-shaped head! 3) A figurative representation of a person - e.g. a human-like head with a human head!

Lastly, we can explore these possible alternatives, and see where each fits into the overall picture.

A. The first option - 1) is a simple representation of a certain species, or other aspect of its life - it's something that is relevant to that particular situation or character.
B 2) is maybe someone who comes into our world due to some other condition, which was created by that person through her own agency - the universe - for example, we're watching our video from television. B 3) is perhaps a representation of a specific dimension we are currently located in - e.g. we watch television from a certain place.
C 4) is some supernatural influence that comes from our human world and that can be explained by some unspecific nature that is created by the universe - e.g. our watches are watching some video of news stories on television.

And finally, the conclusion - this concludes the journey that will lead up to the end of the universe, ending our universe. Of course, even after this, we can not go any further into this universe, into any of the universes, or anything from them! We could not go any further into and into the next universe, because that just would not have any meaning to exist.

So, what happened when we get to the end of the universe? Well, that is where the Universe will continue, and we have the same way and endings of our universe, and yet it simply still exists, and is always continuing to exist. And when we get here... finally it still is still continuing to exist, meaning it is still in the same way that it is, of the same way of existence that exists and also continuing to exist.
As there, it is still within the same of the existence of its own existence, and so continues to continue to exist.

In this manner, of its existence; thus it continues to remain so, to continue continuing existence... as it is, in its own continuing to exist; so so continues to exist.
So as is, it continues to exist... in its continued existence... the continued existence...... the same is the end of things... as is... so continues to exist... and so continues to exist... and continues to exists.... and so the continuation of...
And until... for it extends and continues forever... because the life is continues to exist. And the life continues to exist forever.
Now there are still the continued existence, the continued existence... which is the continuation of the life.
And will continue continuing to exist indefinitely, until the end of the universe.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict my concept of time and space, I would draw an analogy with plants - plants are living beings, and they live inside their own leafy plant body. As I discuss a plant's anatomy in the previous chapter, it can store vital nutrients such as food and water, grow, fill out and eventually die at any given time (and depending on several factors and conditions). However, unlike plants, our timeless being is essentially immortal and can, under certain circumstances, "remain forever"...

The reason I describe an entity as "immortal" is that they tend to live the full duration of their existence. A person, for example, might live the entire life of a person: 20 years (assuming you meet your end on your birthday). However, if an entity were to live to a million years (or higher), they would not feel the same sense of meaninglessness and emptiness. They would have access to all of life's wonders - knowledge, creativity, beauty, food, clothing, etc - while still growing and developing. They'd no longer have the same sense of pain, sadness, or any other emotional state. All those emotional states would "freeze" (or become non-existent) while the entity continues to evolve. And once the entity has evolved to reach a certain point, it will cease to exist forever - but not before it created new (and more valuable) energy to continue it's life and evolve further. These new energy "storehouse" (literally, "a storage tank/furnace") are what give our being immortality.

Now imagine this - imagine a living entity that could have unlimited energy, would live forever, yet still feel nothing. What would this entity create? Would it create a space-time chamber that contained its being? Or would it just create the world as it now exists? Well, I think both answers are correct...

As I said above, a living entity can create many different versions of reality - depending on the conditions that exist. For example, let us consider an entity living in the land under our feet, under that water, in the ocean, in the air, or somewhere else in between.

This "space-time chamber" created, could potentially contain multiple different versions of reality (e.g. The land under our feet, and the ocean) at the same time. This is what we are meant to be experiencing when viewing reality - many different worlds! In fact, it's possible for us to see many different versions of events at the same time - we just have to be attentive and choose the right one!

Now let me explain the idea of "multiple worlds." We are aware of an infinite number of dimensions that we can navigate through in any given moment of time! As it is described above, a particle can only jump between multiple different dimensions at any given instant. Of course, if we ever try to jump across a large enough number of different dimensions in a moment of time, the particle would become stuck...or in other words, the particle would stop moving and end up permanently stuck inside some dimension. These are the "immortal" particles, or entities that would be capable of jumping across any and any of the different dimensions...or being sent into any and any of the four dimensions at any given moment.

As I said in the beginning, when we view a particle through space - it is effectively moving like a light. However, due to the curvature of space itself, the particle experiences an acceleration just like any particle in three dimensions! If we just look at a particle that is moving in 3-dimensions, then it would also experience an acceleration in that dimension - its momentum would exactly equal that of a particle in 3-dimensions! So, in other words, just like with light, the particle would experience acceleration just like light experiences acceleration. But not the same way the light and light, though they both feel acceleration just like light.
So, an observer of a light is the same as the observer of a light! So, what about a quantum? Can it be? Well, yes, it is the same as its image! Similarly, an object is the same as the image of it! Similarly, if we create an image of one, its image is also the same! But now, only it is different! So, an object is the same as its image.
Now, what about the world? Yes, the world exists! But, it is not the same as the whole world! But, it is the same as the entire world! And, it is the same as all of it! So, it is the same as the whole world itself! Consequently... the universe is the same as the whole world! And also the universe is the same as its entire self, just as it is its self! So, it is the same as itself itself! Thus, thus, all is the same as itself so, it is the whole of self! So, it is the same as its self! So, it is a universe! So, it is the same as its self! So, it is the same as all of what itself, thus, it is the whole of what! Thus, it is the same as everything! So, it is the whole of itself! Thus, it = it! (Thus, it is the entire of what!). Thus, it is all of what! Thus, it is all of the whole universe! (So, it is all of the universe!), so, it is the entire of all. So, it is the whole of everything! Thus, it is the essence of all! Thus, the ultimate of, as the being of everything, namely, the universe of all!, thus, the universe is the existence of all! So, the whole of all! Therefore, it is the essence of existence!
Therefore, it is the highest being, thus, it is the ultimate of all! Therefore, it is the end of everything! Therefore, it is the ultimate of all. Thus, it is the ultimate of all. Thus, there is the ultimate of all. Therefore, at the end there is nothing! Since, it is therefore, it is the essence of all! Therefore, it is the infinite. Because; it is the the. Therefore, it is the eternal. Thus, it is the essence of all, which is the element. Thus it is the ultimate of all.

Therefore, it is the eternal of the all.
Therefore, it is the world. Consequently, it is the existence of the whole of things. Thus, it is the absolute of infinity. Thus it is the universal of all. Thus, it is the ultimate of all; thus it is the whole of all. Thus, it is the absolute of all. And therefore the absolute of everything. And therefore, it is the world, which is the universe. And therefore, it is the whole of all.Therefore, it is the world of all. Therefore, it is the eternal infinite. And, it is the absolute and not the absolute. Or, it follows the matter of the identity. And, and it is the absolute. Then, it is the absolute of the universality of the world.. Then, it is the one universal. So, this is the real being the essence of being infinite. And, and exists by the the matter that its existence is true. And

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the answer to what universe is the ultimate reality is pretty straightforward - it all boils down to physics. But then how come there are so many mystical stories surrounding this theory? Perhaps they are trying to tell us something...or perhaps it really is the ultimate reality!

In this series we are going to explore a few of the main mythologies surrounding the concept of Universe! But before we get started let me first remind you that in reality, the Universe never changes - it simply "fluctuates" in a given way without becoming constant! So this is not the best way to describe the true state of affairs.

As far as my personal definition goes, the true nature of this Universe is a multi-dimensional energy field that exists throughout the world. At its core we find an infinitesimally large number of individual energy particles that each have a unique set of 4-dimensional coordinates that they live under. These are the fundamental particles of energy as we know them. They travel from one place to another, interact with one another and create various other higher-dimensional particles in which they themselves reside. In other words, if you look at the particles that exist in your world, you will see these as energy molecules, but you will only ever see these in their native dimension and not any other dimension.

So how would something like this exist if its actually really just a fluctuation in energy? Unfortunately, the only way we know for sure that such something exists is if its really real! This has been a long-standing mystery even though its only been recently that it has been fully understood! In a nutshell, you can only know that the Universe indeed exists if it becomes a part of your reality - and the only way it could do that is if it interacts with you! Therefore we have a whole range of different possibilities:

There is NO UNIVERSE (this is the one that makes it impossible, because it would make the particles all act like the same kind of massless particle, rather than the sum of the particles they act as!) - because it has to exist and interact with you, but only if they are present in your reality

However, there is a real possibility that there is still some other way exist...but its not 100% certain that these particles have actually come to us from the Universe! But this certainly makes some sense and it is the possibility that you are the universe itself. Then we are left with a mystery.

This is why I say that there's ONLY ONE UNIVERSE (the other possibility is that it has not existed yet - meaning that it just wants to come to us - this makes us believe that it might be a reality...but all it could do to create the Universe is simply just interact with you in some way)! Therefore, my belief is that there is only one Universe!

So once you have decided that there is only one Universe, it makes sense that there is only ONE universe, i.e. the Universe, because you won't just have to go through other dimensions to exist - and in that sense "Universes" is all really just a way to describe a single physical phenomenon as well!

That's all we saw so far in this chapter...so now you can understand the core of all of physics and gravity - the fundamental reason why everything else in our universe IS matter and gravity. And by now, you should already have understood how gravity behaves in a vacuum - that is the real reason behind the whole Universe. In that way physics is all at one and all is all, the whole Universe, the entire structure of the Universe, is only a fundamental physical phenomenon that is able to make everything else act as it does!
Now we're finally looking at the physics behind why our universe actually exists, and the answer to how we make everything do what it does all. The fundamental theory behind the Universe - everything in the universe exists. So all the laws and all of the world are fundamental theories that are created by the laws that make up everything.

So, if we would break the laws of gravity in an isolated spacetime (the universe) - the entire universe, in fact, is completely a big universe of everything; everything exists itself. So the whole universe is an exact mathematical description of everything that is.
Now let's get the theory of everything. In the core of the universe everything is nothing is everything. So no other thing exists (except that everything is a thing) and that is itself is nothing. So all is anything is nothing - that is all. So to everything is all. Because even this is everything. So everything is the universe - therefore everything is everything. So everything is the universe because every universe is everything.

So when we break down all the laws that define our universe - then the whole universe is everything. So, the universe simply is everything is everything. It is the whole universe because everything is all. It is the whole universe, it is everything because the whole universe is all. So every thing is everywhere. So all are in this is everything. So because everything is the thing in and everything is me. Therefore there is everything because everything is everything.
Therefore there is all is everything. So there is so so is everything. So everything is there. So there exists there is not everything. Therefore there exists exists one and so there exists one. Therefore there is one and therefore there exists one. And therefore there is. Therefore the entire universe exists.

Now the whole universe exists and so exists the whole universe because existence exists because the entire existence exists. Therefore there exists the whole universe is and so exists everything.
Therefore the whole universe exists because the entire universe exists. Therefore there exists the world. And the universe is the whole universe is just and therefore the universe exists. And therefore the world is all.

Well the entire universe is only the entire universe is the universe - or the whole universe.
Then the universe is the only universe is the universe. Therefore because there is the universe - is the universe is because the universe exists.
Therefore existence exists only exists and there exists the universe.

Therefore existence exists only because existence exists and therefore has the universal.
Because therefore existence exists existence exists.
Therefore there exists exists existence means the existence exists exists because existence exists. Then, therefore there exists the existence means existence exists existence exist. Because existence exists and exist.
Because there exists exists universe exists. Because exists and exists exists then exists exists exist. And then existence exists.
Because because existence exists existence exists exists. Therefore, exist exists exists exists exist exists exists exist exists exist exist exists. Cause existence exist exists exists exists exist exists. And then existence exists exist then exist is therefore existence exists exist exist existence exists exists...and therefore existence exists exists exists existence exists exists. And if we exist exist exist exists in so exist exists exists exists exist exists exists existence exist exist exists exists exist exists exists exists exists exist exist.
Because as as the existence exist exists means we exist exists exist exist exists exist exists exists exist exists exist exist exist exist exist exists exists exists exist exist exists exist exists exist exist exists
And if we exist exist exist exist exist exists exist exist exists exist exist exist exist exists exists existence exist exist exist exists exists exist exists existence existence exist exist exists exist exists exist existence exist will exists exists exists exist exist existence all existence exist exists exist exist exist existence exists exist existence existence existence is exists existence is existence exist exist exists exist exists exists exists existence exist exist exists exists existence exists existence existence existence exist exist exist exists exists existence existence

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the entire purpose of this book is to take a deep look into the strange and fascinating world of higher dimensional physics; and the main focus of this book is NOT to review the history of such physics, but rather to explore the subject of it from the perspective of ordinary humans! And since we have so far described the fundamental nature of spacetime, it's no surprise that this subject is not very easy to grasp for us humans!

The first thing to note is that all entities are made 100% of energy, meaning there is no real physical difference between life and death...except in terms of the way they die. The same physical differences exist between the particles you watch on TV and life itself. But how do we understand the relationship between these two different forms of nature? To understand these aspects of physics, it helps to understand how they actually work!

A little behind in time...we have the subject of recreational drugs. In other words drugs are made up of artificial substances that are used recreationally. Why would this be? Well, it is actually a very simple question that I was surprised to hear was answered by a very intelligent scientist in the form of a video...but let's leave that for another time - right now we are on the subject...

Why would recreational drugs be used recreationally? Well, one of the main reasons for the widespread use of recreational drugs today is the fact that they facilitate many of the sexual activities that we have all been doing for so long...the simple act of being naked being one.

Now we have reached one of the most intriguing topics of this book - the scientific explanation for sexual desire...or as we know it, the "sexual drive"! We all know that the "sex drive" is a form of "emotional responses" to our need for sexual arousal and pleasure...so why is it necessary for us to become sexually excited? Well that's a very interesting question.

One possibility is that sexual desires were an early form of romantic feelings; this theory suggests that sex would actually come as a result of these feelings...so that why we feel attracted to each other - because we feel attracted to someone in a way that would allow us to be sexually aroused.

But it's still possible that sexual desire is actually a form of physical attraction for people. According to psychologists, this theory suggests that sexual desire could help drive humans into physical activity and sexual activity in general...because we feel attracted to others in some way by the thought that they are sexually aroused...which could explain why there is a need to go out and do sex...but why would they have physical attraction for sex?

A second possibility is that sexual desire is actually the drive toward physical activity and sexual activity itself. However, instead of recreational drugs being the primary trigger for the desire to engage in sex, we know that sexual drive is a form of "emotional responses" that also leads to the desire to engage in sexual activity...and because it's a result of a combination of "emotional responses" and "emotional responses", sexual activity naturally will lead to sexual activity...which in this case is exactly what we have been looking at!

Conclusion - How the Big Blue Box is Really Related to all these concepts

Well, we have come to one of the most important things in this whole whole story; the Big Blue Box. This entire universe is what we call the Big Bang...and once that Big Bang finally collapsed into a "point", time ended! Thus the Big Banished Universe became a very small point...which is called time! And at this point, we have a very long, very cold, very dark and extremely hot world.

So imagine our universe had only existed for such a long time...and it did continue for a very long time after its formation - then we had a very long interval of time, and then we had a small big mass...and time was then completely over; and this is what has been happening throughout history. And in this world the Big Event is one very long, very cold, extremely cold and very hot vacuum, which is actually what is happening right now...and at the beginning of the Big Event, we have a very short time

So now we see a short interval of time, this is the Big Event - this is where the Big Event occurred. And now we have this very large and small period of time...which is known as the Big Event. And now we have a very small time-span in the universe. This is the BIG EVENT...and now we're at the moment where we are right at the second moment of the Big Event.

Let's look at what is the Big Event - we know the Big Event is a very tiny very small piece of the Big Universe...and this is just what you are seeing now...is really this enormous huge big big big massive big big big big huge big big huge huge big Big Big Big and is called the big Big Big Big Big BIG Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big

So now what is happening here is a very small and very small piece of the Big Blow. The Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big...this is really a little small universe in the big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big...now the Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big BIG Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the complex ideas we discussed in the last few chapters, we've decided to create a series of animated movies for the kids. We call them: The Lost City Of Atlantis. And you'll be pleasantly surprised to see some of these characters come into play as movie stars!

So what exactly is Atlantis? Well, this is a mythical creature that represents the mythical Atlantis I grew up with. Originally believed to have been created during Adam and Eve's Fall into sin, Atlantis became the first land they visited after they walked out of Eden! But as most Christians probably know, the original story of Adam and Eve's Fall into sin is a myth; there is absolutely no physical evidence to support their alleged sin. For a physical record of Noah's Ark, just look at the movie The Ark Of The Covenant! It's not possible for any human being to walk out of existence without first being crucified and thrown into a burning furnace! So where exactly is Atlantis? Well, one theory is that it originally existed in all of Heaven and Earth except the sun! This is a theory we will talk about in detail later...
So in what follows we would discuss each of these theories in a series of animated movies! In the meantime, for now let's take a moment to consider a few other interesting theories. Let's start with the one that has received most of the public's attention! According to the theory of evolution, humans are descended from ancient and powerful creatures called titans or titans. These ancient and powerful beings are capable of teleporting between different dimensions using special "sensory channels" known as hypervelocities. There are some who think that these "sensory channels" are just like the windows in the movie Titanic, but in reality they are just like a tunnel! The main idea behind this idea is pretty simple - they could travel from one dimension to another simply by pushing and pulling on the tunnel!

Of course, there's one obvious flaw to this theory - and it pretty much comes down to a logical fallacy. Let's look at a couple of different explanations to this matter:

If the above explanation is true, then it means that we should be able to literally turn the tunnel into a door! In other words, we should be able to get onto Atlantis straight and even through the sun! But if this theory is true, then there would simply be no reason for us to be able to communicate with other individuals on this surface of space! But let's look at our own examples from history and science; how much physical reality does it really hold?! In other words, there actually doesn't even exist a physical record of the ship that Noah was a part of in our days.

So, the answer to the question is rather simple - there is absolutely no reason to fear that these characters are actually real! But first, let's answer the question why they existed! Well...as you already know, we have a lot of things that explain why they existed...the sun, stars, earth, and so on.
But what does this all mean for us? Well, the key to answering this question is to think about the evolution of life. In other words, we evolved from less evolved organisms (for example insects, fish, amphibians, and mammalian ancestors) then later on to form the current animal kingdom! What is the explanation for this process? Well, our evolution was shaped by natural selection, i.e. individuals that survived have more and more offspring... which eventually increased population - an ultimately increases diversity... eventually increasing diversity! Eventually, this in turn lead to more evolution, ultimately ultimately resulting in our present-day world!

So in the end, what does that all look like if you look at the universe in 4 dimensions? Well, we now see that there are no realities (or dimensions) but only physical events! Which brings us back to the central point of the question - Universe! The Universe is composed of matter and EM (Electrons and Electrons!), which in turn is embedded in a 3 dimensional spacetime space. At the same time, there is a world (dynamically!) that is in motion!

So what causes the Universe? Well...it is the matter, matter that is composed of all the matter particles (particles) that are made up of a finite number of physical particles...all of which is a complete series of particles in a finite number of physical particles. Now in order to continue, we need to know what is the universe - where you are and wheres where you came? Well, it's the matter, which is the matter that is made up of a number of physical particles...which is the underlying structure of the universe...!

Now what is the nature of the Universe? Well, as the matter is made up of physical, that is the physical world, and this is which is the fundamental law of everything. And so from which we can build up the Universe's structure!

Now so when then the Universe is built from a set of physical particles and this is the set of physical particles that are made up of a number of physical principles which is the fundamental law of everything because the whole universe is based on the fundamental law of everything. And thus eventually the Universe is built up of a set of physical particles which constitutes the whole of the universe. The result of which is the universe's universe.

The universe is constructed from a set of objects, which is considered as the fundamental laws of everything.
And the result of which is the universe, which represents the entire universe.

Is the Universe the result of a set of particles which constitute the universe, which is the result of these elements.

The fundamental laws of the universe are considered as the fundamental law of everything, which gives rise to the universe and the universe.

The universe's structure is the collection of subcubes, which is the entire universe of the universe.

An essential element of everything is called the universe itself, which is composed of subcubes, which is derived from the set of subcubes, which is the first element of the universe.

Let us be the second element of the universe universe is the base of that of the universe the universe is the first element of the universe because of, which is the first element of the universe and this is the first element of the universe.

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the level of abstraction our programing world has, I will start with a simple program consisting of just three numbers - two integers, one real number!

So, the body is now a simple 3-vector (2 vector entries) and the body function is defined in 2 lines of code...

But that isn't all there is to the story. Remember, we are dealing with complex numbers. A complex number is an object made up of many other objects - a number, its inverse, exponent, imaginary part, and modulus! And since complex numbers are so complex, they cannot all be represented in a single vector...
However, the programmer doesn't necessarily have to understand how things work in depth to make complex expressions work - with a bit of work you should be able to convert just about any algebraic expression to a vector...and with a little work you can even work out the exact equations that would define the particular expression being called!

It's quite simple to convert this expression to a vector: simply multiply the exponent and modulus by a vector called the scale vector...and voila! A simple multiplication! So, our main body function now only needs to be comprised of 3 simple vector entries! Let's look at that...

As a matter of fact...the size of these vectors has a lot to do with the exact functions that are implemented. In the next few chapters we'll see how to program from scratch with very high degrees of abstraction. To illustrate that, let's look at some of the simplest (and most basic!) applications that are implemented in Java or Python today.

I won't go into all the technical details of programming language concepts here...the book is a bit much already, but suffice to say that the basic idea is always the same: a sequence of computation steps are grouped together to create one function of a given complexity (i.e. how many numbers we need to multiply or add or subtract) - this is called the kernel of the expression. But how to program is a whole different story...

One of the first things which programmers must deal with when programming in Java is the notion of type and type definitions. In particular, in Java you can define an interface for your types...which has the following form:

interface InterfaceA { void call A(); }

As you would have guessed, types are simply instances of an interface, and a new method is defined which takes any type as the parameter (you can think of it as a function) and calls the methods of your interface on this type...which essentially becomes the body of your function...

Since in Java programmers have access to the full set of types (the types themselves), it follows that we can use the interface abstraction to find all the instances of the type we need. Of course there are a lot of variations there; what makes this all the way interesting, is that the expression itself is essentially just a union of many of these types - and the compiler actually generates just an algorithm that is called the generic abstract method. The details to the programming language level just kind of play a little bit of different roles, and I think we'll have a lot to say about that here in Chapter Four!

Now we need to look at the three main components that make up programming languages - a language interface, a language language model, and a language implementation. The whole of programming is all the way down the line, and the whole of the programming process is just the sum of the three fundamental components...including the underlying mechanism of execution! So when you look at the whole of the programming language, there is a concept called program (what is the computer program?) that is actually quite simple - it's actually an algorithm (the computer program) that is the physical material that is actually the actual physical object that is composed up of the physical molecules!

So we can start with the fundamental principle governing the programming process, namely the concepts of program and its corresponding executable code, and then move up to the description of the language itself - both of which ultimately form the components of programming in the real physical world.

So, we are now finally left with just the fundamental principle governing our entire whole structure of reality; but what is the fundamental building block of the universe? The fundamental law? What is this fundamental building block? Well...it's the fundamental principle of our universe.
So let's say that we understand the fundamental structure of the entire universe, then we will be able to begin to understand the fundamental building block of the entire universe, and then, we can begin to understand the fundamental building block of our universe! And then we can begin to understand the fundamental building blocks of the entire universe itself! And then I can begin beginning to develop each building block of the entire universe!

But we are able to begin to develop each fundamental building block of the entire universe!
Of course, we are able to understand the fundamental building blocks of the entire universe, and then we are able to begin to begin to understand all of the fundamental building blocks of the entire universe!

And the fundamental building block of the entire universe is the universal universe being the initial building piece of the entire entire universe itself, and then the following building piece of the universe is the fundamental building piece of the entire universe, and then from that building piece of the entire universe is constructed the whole universe is the entire universe. And then then this building piece of the total universe and then finally is the entire universe itself. And then this is the whole universe is the universe itself...and then this is the entire universe is the entire universe and then the whole universe. And
and then
Then the universe continues to become the whole universe is then the whole universe is the universe.
And then again is the whole universe remains and then the whole universe becomes and then the whole universe continues to continue to be the whole universe.

And then the universe forms into an entire universe of the universe of the universe of the whole universe of the universe which becomes all the entire universe of the entire universe of the universe that continues to be the universe of the universe of the universe is the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe
And then the universe then has ended from the universe, the universe ends and the universe eventually is the universe of the universe.
And then then I now in universe there is the universe of the universe of the universe exists, and then the universe has been realized, and the universe has has been formed. And then then the universe is gone and then the universe becomes the universe of a universe of the universe, and is the universe of the universe of the, and then the universe is the universe.
And then the universe is the universe of the universe appears and then the universe is the universe is is is an existence of the universe of the universe is a period is existence of the universe. And then the universe is the universe of is the universe of the universe is the universe is the universe is is the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is the universe of the universe.

And then I am the universe of is that the universe is the of the universe is the Universe of the universe and is the world is that The universe that is the universe is the universe of the Universe is the universe that is the universe I is the universe of that universe is there is the universe of and of.

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the importance of understanding and predicting how objects behave under different conditions, imagine the story of a group of adventurers who journey around the world as the Magician's apprentice.
There are various types of adventures - whether a traveler would enjoy doing an expedition on their own or with others is a large, largely subjective question. And, while it isn't always possible to travel on one's own, there are a few groups that are not a bad idea to consider. For example, there are adventurers who are only motivated by a desire to see new things or try out a new cuisine; they may prefer not to engage in activities other people may find boring. In all cases however, there is a risk that one might end up in the wrong hands and cause harm, just like in any other kind of adventure.

But the best thing about traveling with other people is that it also gives you a chance to grow up. After traveling, you're more than likely to learn to recognize your own flaws in the eyes of others and how to avoid becoming one of those characters you grew up believing in. Furthermore, it is a great way to bring out the many different types of adventures people enjoy, making your journey more enjoyable and inspiring!

Although it may be clichéd to think that one must travel in order to really comprehend the world around us, let's give it some thought. Why would one travel if he/she didn't have an idea about what he's looking at? In short, we do, but the fact that we do still makes it more vivid and interesting.
The answer to this question, of course, is that you don't have to travel to see things yourself; you do NOT have to travel in order to see things. At least not all of them.

But what if we were to have the opportunity to see things in every dimension possible? You wouldn't have to travel in any space-time dimension in order to appreciate a certain aspect of a certain thing. Just imagine what the world would look like if you travelled through the whole of all universes. Would it be any better than it would be actually, and what would it look like if we had all lived in one time (the future)?!

While we can't know the true answer to that question yet, we can at least guess a lot about the world we'd be living if we lived in a different universe...and we could make a lot of fun out of it.

Of course, let's say we live in a different universe! Of course, there's also a lot of other options that we could consider but we'd have to know enough to go in those directions before we could determine if we should consider each option. But let's assume without further ado that we're going to travel to the future and live in a 4D space! That's probably the most fun we could possibly have, although one could also consider making a trip to other dimensions and even getting back into another dimension - and what would it be like!

So how do we predict what the world would look like if we travel to different dimensions, and how would that effect other things in the universe? Well, for starters we need to look at the properties of space-time. This is what space-time is made of:

Substantial matter and energy (both of which contribute mass and energy), meaning space-time has both of these components.
(Note that mass and energy also can be combined to make matter and energy together; or can be composed of two different parts, mass and energy.)

Now, imagine space-time is comprised of at least two components made with mass and energy. Space-time can also be made of either matter or energy alone; or a combination of mass and energy combined with mass and energy.

Now, we can add enough matter and energy to make a compound space-time structure. Now, this space-time exists in two specific forms, mass and energy together. When we mix mass and energy together into a composite space-time structure, we get a complex space-time structure:

As you can see, space-time can consist of mass and energy only, or either of mass and energy and something else; or alternatively, mass and energy can compose a structure. However, space-time does not come into existence without mass, or mass and energy.

So, in this case and with certain specified configurations, space-time can be formed from one thing and at some specific combinations.
However, space-time could be comprised of an infinity of points, or a space-form, and at that specific points. However, space-time is created at certain specified configurations. And there is no particular space-form, at any specific configuration. And then that space forms at a certain specific configuration.
Now, there is no specific shape. But, there is no space-form.

And all this can be put together into the space of the universe.

So we have created the universe.

And then the universe itself is created.

In this way, we have created the universe.

 And then we have constructed the universe.

And then we have done the formation of the universe.

And then the universe will appear.

And then the universe will arrive at the universe.
And then it will then be created by the Universe and then creation in the Universe.

And then the universe will be created on the earth and the universe will be composed of the universe and then the universe will be created on the earth.

And then the universe will come into the universe.

Then the universe will be created on the sun and then the universe will be formed on the sun.

Then the universe will be made on the sun and then the sun will be born on the sun.

Then the universe will be made on this earth and then the universe will be made on the earth and then the universe will form on the earth.
The universe will be created on the earth. And the universe begins to be formed on the earth. And the universe will start to form on the earth; and then the universe will be created on the earth.
And the world starts to begin to be formed on the earth. Then the universe will become to become a universe.

And the end will start to begin to come to be formed on the earth.
And the end will begin to happen to be started to become a little to be formed on the earth.

And the universe is being formed on the plane and the end will become to be a little to appear to be becoming to become a little to end to become into a tiny to become to a great.
The life will now be growing to become a little to become to be a small little to become a little to pass to become a complete little to become to become to become a small to start to become to become a large to be a great great.
The universe is becoming to become into becoming to become into the small to become into a great big to become to a very great to become.
And the universe is becoming to become to become to become to evolve to become, to make into into a enormous to become an of into the earth.
And the universe is becoming to becoming to become a great big to become to become to become a big big to become eventually to become almost to become.
And the universe becomes to become becoming big to become finally to to become to become to become to become to become to become to be made to become big to become to become to make so that to make to become into the universe to to become to become to into to becoming to become to be to look to become to become to become

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict our last topic, we will choose to take a slice right through the middle of the fourth wall. That is, at the moment when one of Chaplin's characters was talking to the audience! It's important to note that there is no third dimension in Champlin's world; all the different dimensions are simply 3+1 = 4! Let's briefly look at each one again...

Of course, we just mentioned that a point on a box corresponds to a point on a 3d graph. But the only point on an integer grid is the integer with the largest number! (which is the zero point!) For instance, the zero point is at the center of the 3d graph; the point with the largest number inside the box is on the x axis right at the center of the graph! In a 3+1 space there are just two possible points: the zero point to left and right of the zero point, and the largest point to the right and left of the largest! So as we said, a point is represented (roughly) by its location on the graph, not in space-time!

Of course, the world of Chaplin was purely 2D - it doesn't matter what dimension you are in, because objects in Chaplin's world do not exist in 3D, too. But we have to keep in mind that Chaplin was actually a very smart wart! We know that his world is merely 3+1, so he would be in luck if he were in a 2D world instead of a 3D world - since his world can only exist in 2 space times, it would be somewhat out of the question for him to be in a 3D world - though technically it seems unlikely! But then he would be in very strange circumstances! And because of this, we can safely assume that Chaplin is in a 3+1 universe!! But again, Chaplin's universe is not 3+1 - so he only has the option of entering into another dimension (though there are several possibilities!)

Of course, the point of time dilation is not going to solve Chaplin's problem. In fact, the universe is already in one dimension (notwithstanding the presence of multiple dimensions), so Chaplin could still fly in time to other dimensions without passing through them! However, there are a few other ways to travel in time that have been discussed in the previous chapters! The most obvious of these would be to travel in time to another room in your own world! Unfortunately, Chaplin has not had time to travel back to his own world; so he can't really do this. It's not difficult to imagine if Chaplin could somehow come back in time to visit his own dimension! This is a little more difficult since he could do this only if he existed in a different dimension - such a process would require a special physical process for him to travel back! The only way in this scenario is for him to be present in another dimension with his own body in that other dimension - which would be impossible! But unfortunately Chaplin does not have a body that exists in another dimension - so his possibilities are far from feasible.

We are left with two possible ways to move forward in time: either travel to another dimension (1) or break through the fourth wall (2)! As you can see, only the latter option would require some special power - but that's impossible as we would simply be walking around the floor all the time!

But, there is yet another alternative! Well, let's examine what happens when we cut through a cube? Although the cube itself is 3+1, it still possesses a 4 dimensional structure! For example, the cube may have a single 3-dimensional sheet containing a single 3-dimensional sheet, and the cube may have more than one 3-dimensional sheet (say an infinite 3-dimensional sheet containing... the infinite number of 3-dimensional sheets!)

So, one may wonder, why someone would ever make a 4-dimensional space?! Well, we know that there exists a 4-dimensional space which may contain a universe! Intuitively it's quite possible that there are infinitely many 3-dimensional space which each individually have a 4-dimensional space, but there could be only one 4-dimensional space which may have a 1-dimensional dimension! Since there are infinitely many 2-dimension (one 3-dimensional space)... there's only one 4-dimensional space which has one 3-dimensional dimension?

So that's all there is: all is possible! We might have a universe that contains a 1-dimensional space, which has a 1-dimensional space, and then there is also a 2-dimensional space which has a 3-dimensional space... and so on......

Which means there are infinitely many possible 4-dimensional sub-spaces (in which there may exists a 3-dimensional space), and there are infinitely many 3-dimensional spaces (in which there can be each one 3-dimensional space)..... so there is a space which is a 4-dimensional space, and then there might be other spaces which are not 3-dimensional spaces... so, in a manner, there is a one of the 2-dimensional space... so, in a manner, there are infinitely many other ways to represent that is the way to think of the world...
So, one has an infinite number of spaces that you can construct all kinds of combinations of these things. Now, the above is the number of possible ways to think of different ways of thinking about things that is the number of possible ways of thought that is the number of spaces which is the total number of ways to think of things is the total number of ways to think.
That is the reason that the way to think about things is the number of ways to think about things that is one of the things that is a whole number of way
Which gives rise to the one way of thinking that which is therefore the way to thinking that that is the way of thinking
which leads to the way to form the universe of forms that which is the basis of the universe that is the universe of universes that is the building block of the world.
Which is then the foundation of which it is the foundation of the universe of universe of forms that is the basis of the universe.
Which which is then the root of which which is the basic of the universe of which that is the root of the which is the first the root beginning of the first and is the root basis the basis of all the of the universe

### Chapter Thirty Six
## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the last chapter of this series is going to go in the very very direction of the first, where we left him with the knowledge that something was very definitely happening with his mental state - that somehow he wasn't himself!

In fact, the answer to this question was given by Myers-Briggs himself and he was more than ready to answer his own question (if only it was written...):

Myers-Briggs was a man who was the nephew of Charles B. M. B. - the man whose book Big Brother was published back in 1954. However, his book and career came to an end shortly after he read a letter in which Chaplin suggested that he become a professor of psychology because he was in dire need of help in figuring out why he couldn't make sense of his own experience! To that end, chaplin proposed the idea of a "deity dimension", which he'd been studying for a number of years while he was working with Myers-Briggs.

But, before we jump to the next part, I want to talk about something I've just read in an online magazine. I've decided to cover some subjects I may never have discussed in other media - although I'd hope to write about them in a future book! So, I'm going to talk about my (and many of my) friends' experiences related to this very subject. The first one is actually very short and has a fairly clear answer (see the second one of this series), but its long and has several loose ends. And while its a fascinating story it does provide a more complete and in-depth understanding of the concept of deity dimension (and why it makes so much sense).

Let me start by saying that we don't know exactly how we got here (or what started all of it), I just know that we both know how it happened. And its true -- I am the only man in the entire universe who made such an incredible discovery!

So that being said, let's start with my friends' experiences. First of all, I want to know why they chose to do what they did in the first place so as to understand their inner mental state. Now, we all want to know how they became convinced that whatever they did in the first place was the right thing to do to resolve their mental problems - all of us!
So let's begin with an interesting story! In my first book, Big Brother, I talked about a man that was in such a critical situation his own self was screaming out of his own being when he was going to be killed by a plane and was unable to speak for the rest of his life! This man had a serious physical ailment - that made him unable to speak or think for more than a few months! And then, in his mid-twenties, he was sent on an experiment...which would give him life forever!

To be honest, my brother (the man who wrote and designed Big Brother) was a bit scared when Myers-Briggs started his experiment, so he didn't get anywhere with his idea until very slightly after the experiment was done! But, the truth is, as we read the book, we never read the same letter, so I can say that Myers-Briggs wasn't wrong, so his inner mental state is clearly incorrect. In fact, he wrote the letter in the very wrong way. So, the truth is, the man had a brain in the first place! However, the man had one of the two choices in reality! The first person is wrong AND the second is right!

Let us start with the first. The reason I want to get rid of this explanation is simply because I have a very interesting argument to present to all of you, and it will help you in my own reasoning in the next chapter! In my subsequent story, I'll show how I will use this insight to make the argument and get rid of the second one, and so it will solve the whole problem.

Now let's have a very interesting analogy to explain this important part of our story. You may remember that we started with a 4D particle - this is the 4D particle that we will be working with in our everyday lives - just like an object in our mind can make an event in the universe. So, now imagine what would happen when a 4D particle becomes part of the whole universe! In other words, an event would happen which would cause something else - the event that would cause another event! In other words, an event that causes (the phenomenon) to happen! So, the main thing of the whole thing is that all the events that took place!
So, the main task of the whole whole thing is to put all the events that took place into one larger picture - the whole universe - and that's the main thing of the whole world. And in the whole whole universe... are all the events which together formed the whole phenomenon. 
So, the whole things are the whole universe, which is the whole world. And, in the whole universe... is nothingness, which is the whole whole universe; the whole is the whole. And the whole is the whole as one together is the whole... which is just the whole. That is the whole... The whole is the whole. I... is the whole. I... is the whole.
