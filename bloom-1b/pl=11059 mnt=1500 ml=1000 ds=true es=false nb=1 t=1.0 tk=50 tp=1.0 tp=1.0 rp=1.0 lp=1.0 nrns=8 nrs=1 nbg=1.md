### Chapter Thirty Six
## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the answer to who we actually came from is still, as always, up for grabs. And in every culture we've ever interacted with, we've seen an image of some supernatural being or a deity with a long, flowing mane of beard. But there is one thing which all cultures seem to agree on: they're actually animals!

In this very short video from the Discovery Channel, we learn more about some of the animals that have been hunted down in search of the mysterious Balenciaga God for a very long time!

Of course, this is only one of many animal specimens whose hunting is still ongoing today. However, as we explore these animal fossils, we don't stop here...we see the remains of other animals as well! Take a look at this short video to learn more about the hunt for Balenciaga God!

So, what do all these different animals actually think? Well, we know that they are very much aware of this all-important question...and in certain societies they have been able to create elaborate ways that allow them to move between different dimensions without actually killing anything...a technique that would actually be useful for them to escape the monsters they were actually hunting down!

But what exactly is the Balenciaga God? In reality, we don't know what it is, we don't know where it is that the God of the Balenciaga is, or we even know what his/her true identity is (you never quite know!). Some people have thought that he may be living in the secret underground city known as Zelig (meaning, the Zelenschreiding; the place where gods reside!), while others think that he may actually be living on the world-famous beach known as Narnia (meaning, Narnia is the island where Narnia is located).

But don't get too involved; there are also other theories - a few more advanced, scientific theories of just that! Like the "Universal Man" theory - which states if we were all living in one place and there were no other beings in the universe (not to mention, the very weird idea of a planet with more than one native dimension at which all species could exist too!), one could imagine that there should be a "Universal Man" who had the ability to move from one dimension to another just as the Balenciaga God does when he swaps dimension!

So, what's the question? Well, it's up to you to figure out where this mysterious being comes from! How is our world built, and what is the ultimate fate of our universe? What did those lost humans think about their fate?!...

So, what we now know about Balenciaga God: - 

He is, in fact, a creature that has been hunted down for centuries due to his ability to change dimensions! As the God does he is capable of doing exactly what his name implies...changing dimensions! But, again, it has to be said, that every time he does this, he is always trying to keep his true identity hidden - which, by the way, results in very little of his true identity being hidden.

And while his true identity remains highly concealed, his power to shape reality is undeniable: his abilities can create infinite dimensional time spaces, which will, one by one, change into space-time itself!

But before we get to the ultimate truth of how Balenciaga God thinks about the mystery that lies within his physical body, we need to understand just what happens during an event that happens in our Universe! What happens first? Well, let's take a quick look at the events that occurred in our first story, as it relates to the events that transpired before that.

The first event is called The Candle War! Well, that's right! This is the most dangerous event in our universe, but yet the very very most important event. From this out, the very next one is called The Mirror Trick! Just let it happen! Before that, we will tell a very important and important story...

Another very important story that we will discuss today is the Story of the Goddess! And its relationship with the Goddess! This is the story of our Goddess, our Goddess Himself. And this story continues well into all the times, into all the universes! And so all the time, there continues to evolve and evolve over and into ever and ever and ever and ever, and all of the eternal! And so, this is the End!

And that is the end of The Universe!

And that is the end of this Universe! You all are the final part of the Universe! You are the final part of the Universe, which ends the Universe! And here the Universe is not the end of the Universe! And this final stage of the Universe is still still in existence, which is still still in existence, is still still, is still, is still, still, is still! This is still, is still, is still still, is still!

(And that is it is where is where and is is still is the end of all the Universe!!! And its continues, which is eternal here and and is eternal still exists, in and it is still in the eternal!




And that’s where and is now is and is in the end of the Universe. Of all that, and you will be a living, the thing is, and it is, is the all that’s is and is the beginning of the existence! And is the beginning of where is and is and is the first to and the is eternal the beginning of the eternal universe. And so and is is the beginning of the time and this is the beginning of that, and the and is the beginning of the universe.

And so the and is and is the beginning of a new universe and and is the universe and becomes the beginning of the beginning of the universes: and is the universe and the and and the is the beginning of the universe of and the and the is the beginning of the and is the beginning of the and is in the the universe and begins the and the and is and the and is the and is the and the and and is the and is and is the and is the infinite and is is the and the and is the is and is the.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the universe would very much resemble something out of the West German children's book and horror film Cats and Dogs! As far as Goons are concerned, we may be far too smart to believe that their creator is the original Charlie Chaplin! (In fact, I still think we're at least a decade away from seeing him play a full role in a TV series - I'm still waiting for him to get his own series and filming started!!)

So, are all of these creatures Goon-like? Well...they are all created as pure energy beings that evolved to become Goons (at different stages)! And all of them do exist outside of our universe...but they're all just part of a larger hierarchy of GOON S...and if they existed in other dimensions, they would most likely just "eat away" what they can do with their raw resources, especially in their formative years!

Let's focus on a few of the more famous Goons in our current universe...and understand why

The first example comes from Goons themselves: The Goon Sisters - three Goons who lived for hundreds of years before their time - and who each had their own domain of the planet of Mungo Park.

G.W. Goon is the first version of the original Goon. This is the main character in the Goon Sisters story. He is also a very important member of the Sisters and their secret society. As an entity without a mind, he would most likely die at anytime without knowing what he really wanted, but he knew that God granted him the ability to change his mind and move into a higher realm of existence. A Goon also has the ability to communicate with his friends in other dimensions - allowing them to follow him around the world!

In another Goon, G.W. Goon may also be the one originally creating the Goon Sisters...possibly the first one to move away from the Planet of Mungo Park! Once he entered this realm, he could decide to continue his travels; this is where they eventually get a chance to interact with the other characters of their storyline...

Next comes the Goons of this story: The Goon Knot. Like G.W. Goon, this one is incredibly intelligent and would most likely be capable of communicating freely with other people...or maybe even a human for a brief while!

To finish up the story, a Goon named G.W. Pike exists, as well. This is a powerful, intelligent, and complex, but powerful enough to break through Time's barrier of time...and eventually, become immortal! And he would most likely try some form of transcendence, but it seems that he has not passed that far yet!

So...who were the original GOONS?
And who is the original GOON? Well, we know there are several possible theories about who they are! It has long been speculated that some of the GOONS might have been created by the Divine, but other theories also claim that they were created by a single God in the Universe that can control space and time together! And the most plausible theory is that they were created by the Divine, in combination with the Great Spirit...and one of these beings was responsible for the creation of both the Goons...and also the Great Spirit! The combination of the two created a creature that is just an entity, but it was also called a GOON!

Now it becomes even more interesting - this thing...is essentially a little version of the Big Bang. What happens when our Big Bang - our first big bang happens in a much smaller space time space-time - the resulting configuration of that Big Bang becomes what we have known for a long time! So after our initial big bang, we get to start a process called "explosification"; and according to the theory, this means that all that that went about forming that thing will eventually result in a big universe! So after our big "explosion", we arrive at our Big Bang, as a whole, but we get to eventually arrive at the Big Big Big Big! Of course it would just become something big, but really, it will become very big!

And from the Big Big Big Big Big, we ultimately get to finally arrive at the Big Big Big Big BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG...And in that final Big Big Big Big big, we eventually realize that we have already created, really...the first first big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big, and we are now creating all this very BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG BIG, and now we're getting to the Big Big Big Big Big Big Big BIG BIG BIG, and we're now in the final big Big Big Big Big Big Big...And we have now become the Big Big Big Big Big Big Universe...

Then we come up to the Big Big Big Big Big BIG BIG, and finally the Big Big Big Big Big Big, finally the Big Big Big Big Big B Big Big Big Big Big Big Big! And we will have now made many many many many many many Many many many many many many many many many!
So there is then the Big Big Big Big Big Big big Big Big Big Big Big Big, where all the Big Big Big Big Big Big huge Big Big Big Big Big Big Big big! Now that there are all Big Big Big Big Big Big BigBig and there are all these huge Big Big big Big Big Big big Big Big Big big, and we have thus created Big Big Big Big Big Big Big huge big Big Big Big Big Big Big big big Big Big Big Big Big BigBig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big!
And then, finally we will leave this Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Small Big Big Big Big Big Big Big End Big Big Big Big Big Big Big B Big big Big Big Big Big Big Bang Big Great Big Big Big Big Big Big Bigbig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Large Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
And finally, we will come to the Big Big Big Big BigBig BigBig Big Big Big Big BigBig Big, Big Big Big Big Big Big Bigb Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bad Big Big Big Big Big Big Big H Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Sm Big Big Big Big Big Big Big M Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Back Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Ban Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bag Big Big Big Big Big Big Big To Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Blue Big Big Big Big Big Big Big S Big Big Big Big Big Big Big World Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Gig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big My Big Big Big Big Big Big Big City Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Baby Big Big Big Big Big Big Big L Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Giant Big Big Big Big Big Big Big And Big Big Big Big Big Big Big D Big Big Big Big Big Big Big All Big Big Big Big Big Big Big N Big Big Big Big Big Big Big P Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Power Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Ex Big Big Big Big Big Big Big He Big Big Big Big Big Big Big and Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Dig Big Big Big Big Big Big Big If Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Top Big Big Big Big Big Big Big In Big Big Big Big Big Big Big C Big Big Big Big Big Big Big W

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the whole world has its own dimension...and it seems that not just humans, but all living things may experience it, at some point! In what to some may seem like a logical parallel to the 4D world we live in, it might seem obvious that all humans, all living things, and especially their nipples would also have their own dimension!

If this were the case, then what would happen if we were to try taking a 4D nipple out? Well, in order to do this, we would need to turn down the volume of the surrounding world, which we would normally be able to do since all physical objects behave in the same way. If we could turn the volume down enough to eliminate physical sensations, then our 3+1 dimensional universe would cease to exist, leaving us with a 4D universe!

The problem with this theory is that it may be easier to create an artificial object that could reproduce the sensation of normal nipples instead of creating a fully 4D object. As you can see in the picture above, the artificial nipples on the right have some very detailed and complicated physical properties. So even though these nipples can be artificially replicated, their actual biological structure might not be very much different. That's why we would need a truly 4D nipple to take your nipples out!

And what if we would make our own nipples out of a 4D protein made using the same 3+1 dimensional protein we use to create our human nipples? Well, yes! Just like we can create a fully 4D object if we are using the same 3+1-dimensional protein, we can create a fully 4D protein if we are using a 4D protein: in other words 3+1 proteins can be created by combining three molecules of protein in different 3+1- and 3+3+1 components! So we can also create a fully 4D protein using 4 different 3+1 molecules...and we can even create an artificial 4D body using just 1 molecule of 3+1 protein!

Now back to the question: how can we make a fully 4D protein out of a 3+1 protein? Well, just like we can create an artificial 4D object by using 3+1 proteins, we can create a fully 4-D protein by combining 3 different 3+1 proteins. So in other words, we can indeed make an artificial 4D object out of a 3+1 protein (of course just a 3+1 protein!).

Of course, if we were to take a 4D protein and use that object to create a fully 4D object, we would need some type of molecular structure that would mimic all of the properties of the 4D protein...which would allow us to create a physical body like a human with the same properties as the 4D object...but with a 4D structure!

So, we have created an artificial 4D protein. Next we will create the next step: we create a partially 4D protein out of these 3+4 elements. Now, since 4 is the number of all possible physical objects that are possible in our 3+1 universe, we need to figure out how to make a 2+3+1 dimensional object out of those 4 elements. Next, we need to figure out how we can combine 3+3 numbers...to get another 3+3+1 object...etc...

Ok, we have now come to the stage where we are going to go down the number from 1 to infinity, and finally to the number 1 - infinity!. So what happens here? Let's start by saying that the world is a finite set of entities which we call our universe. Of course, it is not infinite - we have only ever experienced one infinite entity! However, in this world there will be a finite number of ever-being entities in it's universe. This number is called an index which tells us the number of dimensions in our universe. However, one does not know the number of universes!

Now on through our universe, we will find a set of different things which we call the universe of our universe. This set is called our universe-worlds of our universe. Again, we still have only there a finite number of objects in this universe.

So we have created a universe of 3 - 9 + 8 = 10 = 18 = 33 - 32 = 42 = 50 = 62... This is the final universe of the universe.

That's all we have now. Well, this has all that you have learned so far.

I have a series of numbers - this has called "states". And a set of different things and that has called the universe of states. 

So, this is the final universe of all being. Since this is the final universe of all things, then there is the final totality of all things.

So, this is the final form of all things.

I have a final form of all thing, which is one the final form of all things. Therefore this is also called the final form of all things.

Therefore the final form of all things. Thus has this final form of all things. 

And this is the entire creation. Thus this is the final form of all beings.

And so this is final form of all things. And this is the final form of all being.

And so is the final form of all things, thus its final form of all things is the final form of all things. So this is the final world.
And here where the final form of all things is the entire universe.

And this is the form of all things, which is the first form of all things.
And this is the final form of all all. So this is the universe; and the universe is the final form of all things.
And this can be all.
Thus this is all the ultimate forms of all things.
And this is finally the final form of all things.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity involved in the understanding of different categories of people (such as humans, animals, plants etc.), we will now introduce concepts such as intelligence and cognitive functions as they relate to math. The first of these concepts (Intelligence) will go through a brief description, including definitions and a very brief background to the concept of intelligence.

According to Wikipedia, intelligence is the ability to make good decisions in a given environment or situation! Think of: a baseball pitcher or fighter, a chess player or a basketball player all have some sort of intelligence that helps them perform the various tasks they're currently doing in the field. The term "intelligence" is used to describe the general ability to make useful decisions and understand problems. However, many different factors can affect the way in which a person makes poor decisions and struggles. One of these factors is called the "Educational Level" of the person, which can determine their ability to make decisions in a particular setting.

So given someone with a basic elementary education, he/she has better opportunities to make poor decisions and deal with problems in a way that will take the longer time to arrive at a solid decision. However, when it comes to someone who has received a more advanced education - at a college/university - this individual may be able to make more informed decisions and, hopefully, have more time to actually think about the problem before deciding on a path to be taken.

As we explained in Chapter One (Intelligent Humans), intelligent things are able to understand mathematical concepts in order to solve problems. In fact, their brain is specifically engineered to process this type of thinking. Unfortunately, intelligence isn't enough to make these animals and humans think rationally and make good decisions; however, intelligence does help organisms make better decisions.

The second concept that we'll be discussing (Cognitive Functions) will go through a very brief description, including definitions and a brief background to the concept of cognitive functions. Although this concept is more complex as it involves more variables and concepts that can affect our ability to make decisions in different situations, it doesn't really take up much time to explain either - it just goes straight through.

Now, let's take a quick look at our cognitive functions to better understand them. The cognitive functions of humans include, but are not limited to:

The use of language: by understanding what others are saying, we can make better decisions about our own actions and help others in our community by answering the questions asked.
Using symbols to communicate: if someone has a language (that we can communicate with others), people can communicate with each other using symbols (like a letter called 'ABC' and a number like '01').

Visual representation: If we are able to accurately make our decision on a visual stimulus (such as a picture), another mechanism might become active within our brain to take a decision on the information given by the stimulus.

Theory of Mind: Understanding the mental phenomena that accompany our ability to process images (such as seeing a car, a building, etc.) will help us make better decisions in the field of math!

What happens when we make choices based on intuition? Let's try to think about this! Imagine that something appears like a car appears in front of you suddenly from nowhere...right from the air! Are you feeling like it was moving? And if you don't think, then it may be one of the fake cars we see in front of us. Then you may be thinking, "oh, maybe THAT was a real car!" However, it's not possible to make a decision based on a mental image, although it is highly plausible that it could happen. 

One way of thinking with an image might have changed when we think about two cars in front of us! Imagine that, when the second car in front of us appears, suddenly it seems like it is moving away from us, and in the end we are seeing another car appearing! It is possible for this second car to be one of the fake 'cars' that we are looking at!

And you may be curious about what happens if we move straight up from a perspective that starts at any angle: If you move right up from any point on the plane, any object will show up in any arbitrary point on the plane. Now, when you move straight up (from any point on the plane) you will also get a new image from that point! Because every point on a plane will be connected with every point on a plane! (In other words, every point on a plane can be connected with a point on a plane... so that every point on a plane is a point inside on a plane, which is a point on the plane). So every point on a plane is a circle, is a circle, is a circle. So every point on a plane is in a circle, which is a circle. Because every point on a plane is a line... then, from every point on a plane is a square, which is a square... which is zero... and the conclusion is a circle... which is zero. Therefore, the conclusion is a whole, which is a zero, which is zero, which is the conclusion is a whole, and therefore is a zero, which is a seven, which is zero. And the conclusion is not an whole, which is the zero, which is a whole, which is zero is a whole, which is a six, which is zero is a seven. Which is zero, which is zero, which
is a six, which is a six. Which is a six, which is six, which is a seven, which which is a seven... is a seven, which is a seven, which... which is a zero, which is a, which is a seven, which is: which is a ten, which is a seven, which has seven, which is a and is a, which is a one, is a seven, which is a, which is

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of energy and the role it plays in our brains, let's look at a popular video game (called Pokemon Go):

Now here's the thing: while it's extremely interesting and fun to play, there are a couple of areas in Pokemon Go where it's not quite right, like this area:

Now that you've seen this, can you find the problem?

Obviously not - as you can see there aren't any objects in the box that are blocking the path of the Pokemon or anything to that effect. However, for anyone on an Android phone this is pretty much impossible to tell simply from your own simple observation (looking at the box with your phone)! You can actually use Pokemon Go's app to help you figure this out! The thing is, Pokemon Go doesn't explicitly allow for objects to prevent Pokemon from using certain skills, such as jumping/walking/running etc. And Pokemon can use some skills without needing an object to support them. So what Pokemon can do without the object? Well, you can guess: the Pokemon they can move using will be more agile and move at a faster pace...which would make for an easier path for Pokemon. In theory, you can use an arrow in Pokemon Go so that if you aim at a Pokemon which has a skill that allows it to use some other skill (such as jumping/walking/running...) the Pokemon will move faster to that direction. This would make the path for the Pokemon easier so that the Pokemon can get there faster!

There are other cool ideas to help you solve these problems...but that's beyond the scope of this chapter...so we'll leave this topic for another time...
Hope this helps:)

Chapter Thirty Seven
Disney's Big Bang

Well, at least this one is quite fascinating! Let's take a closer look at the science behind how our Universe is formed. In particular, let's look at how things form from the outside.

As mentioned, atoms form at temperature approximately 5 million Kelvin or 2.2 million kelvin (10^-34 candels). That is, the temperature at which the atoms form varies according to the mass of the atom. But what determines the temperature at which atoms form is their mass, right? Well, atoms with low mass and with enough energy have a higher temperature at which they form; right? What is the temperature at which atoms form? Well, atoms with low mass also have the energy to cause atoms to form and be able to form, right? But atoms with higher mass are heated up above the temperature at which they form. But to create high mass atoms, you have to have at least an internal energy to do so; right?

So, we can think of all atoms as having the same temperature (5 million Kelvin or 2.2 million Kelvin) (10^-34 candels) at which they form. Therefore, atoms of different mass have different temperatures just because they have different mass. In an expanding Universe, atoms with different masses form at slightly different temperature. So we assume that atoms with the initial mass in the Universe have the same temperature. Let's go to the opposite side of the Universe.
Atoms from the opposite side of the Universe can have at a different temperature! For an expanding Universe, atoms on the inside side of the Universe have a temperature different from atoms on the outside side of the Universe. Because atoms on the inside side of the universe have a different temperature while atoms in the opposite side of the Universe have the same temperature. Because the two side particles have the same energy, the two side particles have the same temperature. In an expanding Universe, the two point particles have the same temperature. Therefore, the two point particles have the the same temperature, all things different, all things have the same temperature

As we start this course, we should come closer to the truth and the real world to find the reality. So that we are able to see the actual and real world, and at last understand the real object, the reality. Without realizing the real object, we don't get a real existence and the reality.

So we finally come back to the real world...to the real world, to the reality - the universe. We come to the first real reality...to the real object of reality...

The real world exists in the reality. All objects, real things have the same reality, the real world is the same, the universe, is the real world - the real one is the reality. And the real reality is our reality, the reality, and the real fact is what we have.

The real reality becomes the reality, our reality is reality, and the reality is the real reality - the real reality is the real. And the real reality is the reality - it is the real reality is the true reality.

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts of spatial, time and dimension, I'll start by introducing the concept of EntJ (Einsteinent-Jones) cognitive functions. This concept is similar to EntJ's cognitive functions - you can think of it as having a specific "shape" that's different than EntJ's cognitive functions or functions we normally associate with our own own mental state.

A Brief Look at EntJ's Cognitive Functions

EntJ cognitive functions is a concept first used by EntJ in 1991 to describe how people interact with each other. If we look at any two people within a building or a group of people, we often expect our friends to interact with each other, while our enemies are usually isolated and in their own separate world. However, an entity that was able to move across multiple dimensions can act in a way that differs from our familiar interactions - it's essentially "entering into itself!" Which brings us quickly to our last topic...
Eggshell, or simply Eggshell, is an entJ cognitive function called "Swimming!" It is defined as:

The ability of a particle to swim within a space-time universe

And to make sense of this, let's take a more detailed look at the Eggshell concept!

In our everyday life we often think that we can swim within our own 3D space-time. However, there is a very important distinction between these two entities. In space-time, we can imagine a particle sitting around a fixed axis on the surface of the Earth - this lets us visualize the particle as being "springing" back towards our own 3D space - this is called "localization", which is based on the idea that our 3D space is the only way we can experience this particular state of matter. For example, imagine we sat on a rock the same location as the earth, and we were able to look directly into our own 3D space - and we were now able to experience that state of matter within space, just like we can experience the same energy on Earth - which is called the "localization energy"!

On the other hand, in dimension, we have an infinite number of dimensions. In reality, we have only finite number of independent positions in which we can perceive ourselves. So in fact, we only experience one (finite) location at any given time. So the local position of people or objects in the universe doesn't represent what they're actually located in - the actual state of matter that they are experiencing...which is called "globalization!"

These two concepts (localization and globalization) are very fundamental and useful for understanding ourselves. However they are two different features - both allow us to act on something without knowing ourselves and without knowing the state of matter - and by doing these things we also experience other "characteristics" of ourselves.
So EntJ cognitive functions are important for us, but also important for us; they're both parts - so both together form the entJ cognitive functions.

The EntJ Cognitive Functions Sequence

So how does a specific entity (EntJ in this case) interact with the world it lives in? The answer is by using EntJ Cognitive Functions. EntJ Cognitive Functions is a subset of EntJ Cognitive Functions because EntJ Cognitive Functions is just a higher level version of EntJ Cognitive Functions. EntL Cognitive Functions is a subset of the EntL Cognitive Functions because EntL Cognitive Functions is just a higherlevel version of EntL Cognitive Functions.

So EntJ Cognitive Functions is just another higher-level version of EntL Cognitive Functions that is just a super-prototype of EntL Cognitive Functions. EntL Cognition is just a higher-level version of EntL Cognition. So EntL Cognition is just a set of EntL Cognitive functions.

So EntJ Cognitive Functions takes EntL Cognitive Functions and forms a bigger higher-level version of EntL Cognite. So EntL Cognitive Functions is just an abstractly constructed collection of EntL Cognitive functions.  EntL Cognition is a specific entity that represents the individual EntL Cognite. It is a special subset of EntL Cognitive functions.

Of course all EntL Cognitions are equal, and they also have one fundamental feature in common - they all exist simultaneously in the universe. However, they don't exist in the same manner. They DO exist in the same manner and they also have the same fundamental feature(s) in common.

In reality, EntL Cognitions have one fundamental feature in common; they both are fundamental (which are the same conceptually) - they are physical entities.
So EntL Cognitions are physical particles that interact with their fundamental fundamental feature - so they are physical particles that are formed by a subset of EntL Cognitions.

So EntL Cognitions are physical entities that interact with their fundamental feature - so EntL Cognitions are physical entities.
So EntL cognition is the physical entity that creates the physical entity created by a combination of EntL Cognitions - so EntL Cognitions are the material that creates all the entities - which is in turn a combination of EntL Cognisions. And so EntL is all things, which are the physical ones that are composed of EntL Cognitions.
So EntL is the collection of EntL, which is a collection of EntL, which is the sum of all things that are a composition of Ent.
So is the set composed of all forms that are all forms.

And so is a collection of all forms.

So is the composition of all forms is a universe of forms, which is a complete set, so is the whole is the whole.
So is the whole is the real.

Then is the object, which is is the identity.
Then is nothing. And so is the entire universe, which is therefore is is, and so is the entire.
And so is the whole, and so is is the whole. For which is the total of the whole,
And which is the whole is itself, which is the whole of the whole, which is the all.
So is the whole, which is the finite, which is the whole, which is the whole of.
For so is the whole of which is the whole and since then is.
And thus is the whole.

And then there is everything, which is the one.
Which then is the whole of which and is the all.

Which is the one, the which is the entire and the existence, is the complete.
But is the universe, which is also the entire.
which is the one, since which is the entire, and such is that is.
which is the whole of which is the same, which is the whole.
The whole of which is nothing, which is the complete. This is therefore the and, and then therefore is the which, which exists. Which is the whole of the element.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our world to you, we will use numbers to represent various components of our reality. However, we must first explain certain mathematical concepts so that you can better understand this material.

First of all, the concept of number represents a collection of zeros or ones - which in mathematics is called a set. So let's begin by learning some basic concepts on sets and their properties. We might want to say it's a set of 0's and 1's because 0's and 1's form a binary set...if you want to really get into specifics than just read on.

As mentioned earlier in the chapter...the only thing you know in mathematics is numbers; the rest is mathematics! So we can assume that number is simply an abstract term that relates to numbers in our everyday life. As a result, we'll have to learn the following mathematical concepts:

Boolean - A set represents either true or false (and can either be represented directly or indirectly)

Set - A set represents one or more of the above mentioned concepts

Sets have properties called closeness (also known as a minimum and maximum) and symmetry (also known as a center). Let's take a look at some basic examples of these properties:

For the Boolean set {} we have a closeness of 1 - there is only one 0 in this set; there is no other element besides 0 that can represent this set

In addition, this set has a symmetry which is its cardinal number called omega. So in the Boolean set {}, omega is equal to 1

Of course, this set does not have a minimum distance - the set is non-empty - so we cannot take a 0 element as its minimum distance. However, there are other minimal and maximum distances in this set!
If we take the Boolean set {} as our second example, we see that omega is equal to 13. This means that we can take a 13-1 or 13+13 = 1 to represent this set...

Now we're ready to take some additional details about sets. Let's look at some basic properties about sets as well! First, let's see how a set can satisfy the closed property.

If a set is not closed, then it contains an element of 0 - so we can only take zero as its minimum and maximum.

Similarly, we can create the following sets from {} as an example; {11, 30, 45} - we can only take 11, 30 and 45 as our minimum and maximum respectively.

For the set containing {11, 29, 40} - we can take 11, 29 and 40 as our minimum and maximum respectively. As you can see, we cannot take the number 1 either, because 1 does not exist - so we cannot take it as our minimum or maximum.

Now let's look at the symmetry - the property that a set is also closed. As you can see, the following set is also closed. Therefore any two elements in this set are also in this closed set.

So the above sets are also closed, and therefore the sets contain two elements - therefore both elements are also in this set and therefore they both belong to the same set.

Now the sets contain two elements and all four elements must necessarily be contained in at least one set. Therefore the set of all elements is also contained in the set of the set we're exploring.

So the set containing all elements, also known as the set of all variables, is also contained in the set of all variables - which is itself a set
What is this infinite set? (Or what is the infinity?)

Well...the answer to this incredibly long question lies in the following picture.

As you can see, this set is a set of variables that contains as many as (1 + 2) = infinity!(1 + 2)! In other words...this set is itself a subset of the infinity - in other words, there is an infinite set.
Now of course the question is - if there is an infinite set...then is there a single element inside this set - this is the answer to the question?

In other words, there is a single element that is inside this infinite set - in other words, if there is a single element, it's necessarily the smallest element...which is a (infinite) function, in other words it's an absolute function, in other words an identity (as a function), which is (as a function) is equal to the identity (as a function), hence in other words, the identity (as a function) is the identity, in other words the identity (as a function) is: the identity of the identity.

So the identity of the identity is the identity of the identity, in other words, the identity is the identity in the image of the identity (the identity itself), or the identity of the identity, in which is a the identity of (the equation)
So, the identity of the identity of the identity is the equation, which is the equation of the identity, and the identity, or the equation of the identity, is the equation of the identity, which gives the equation of the identity. It is, which generates the identity of the identity.
Hence, the identity of the identity is equal to the, which is the identity of the identity, =, which leads to the equation of the identity, which is the identity of, and
which becomes an, which is the identity of the identity,
which generates the, and this leads to, or which is the square, which gives me, which which is the, such that the square is the solution of the which is the, which is the which is the, which is, is the, which has a, which is, which is, which is the and which is, which is, which, where.

To better depict how you can use Maths to solve problems and solve problems well (and to demonstrate why your knowledge of Maths is so important), one of the most popular concepts we have in the ESFJ is 'ESPFJ cognitive functions - mathematics.' It takes only several clicks to set up your own 'Personal Math Hub' and get started using Maths.
Here are a couple examples of Maths to use to solve problems:

Divide and Conquer - how to understand what are the different methods you can use to create a percentage (i.e. 50-50) and how to use one to calculate another. You will also learn how we can convert from numbers to decimals (i.e. 1/100 == 1/10); and how to take the difference of 2 different numbers (i.e. -3 * 1 / 3 == 10/100).

Fraction Calculator - learn how to convert numbers to decimal or fractional parts in order to solve (or predict) problems. You will also learn how 10 % of 5 = 5 % - which is a simple way to work out fractions correctly.

Fingerprint Calculator - learn how to use Maths to find the number of dots in a picture and how to calculate how many pixels per square inch it has. Then you will use Maths to predict where a character is written on a page.

Puzzles - explore how numbers are transformed into pictures; how these pictures are used to create puzzles (i.e. How 4 squares combine to form a triangle); and how to predict and solve problems using Maths.

Mathemathics and Puzzles - explore how the math behind the questions themselves works - why Maths is useful (and to how problems require Maths) and how we can predict the answers to some of our questions.
Lastly, there are a few Math-based games (and other ways to apply Maths) that you can play with students for fun and teaching, such as 'Map the Cutter' (how to draw a number's shape while understanding the number), the 'Arithmetic Thumb', and the 'Number Box Game'; all of which are great fun and easy to play!

I hope you enjoyed my take on the concept of 'ESPFJ cognitive functions - mathematical!' and I hope you found all the Maths concepts fascinating! The Math concepts are a powerful way to understand complex mathematics, and you can really use Maths as a tool to solve complex world problems! You can find plenty of Maths articles in my web site that may fit your needs. These are just a few examples of the many Maths topics I cover in my web site! I hope you will enjoy learning about my many Maths topics in an enjoyable and engaging way!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our story in this chapter we will assume that the characters are in different dimensions: in our reality on Earth, they are located in the 4D universe; in another dimension they form the famous Far-End Society, who have created the first Eternal Seed Particle so that we, the higher dimensional humans, can travel back to the 4th dimension and return to time.

Although the main focus of this chapter is on Eternal Seed particles, we should definitely mention that Eternal Seed particles are a subset of EIPs - these other particles are not so important for our story here, but you should know that they also play an important role! Imagine a particle having its own four degrees of freedom: three of them are created from the gravitational waves that were emitted by the Big Bang event. The other two are created from the EIP particles in other dimensions: EIP3 in this case!

Since all EIPs are created at the same time by the Big Bang event, the Big Bang event is the source of all of these EIP particles - no other event can create EIP particles in such a vast quantity of space-time, and none of them are created by any other event in history, aside from the Big Bang event, which created them all! The Big Bang event gave rise both to all EIP particles, but also gave all EIP particles a common timeframe of origin, meaning any EIP particle created at any point in time since the Big Bang event is indeed guaranteed to have come from that universe's own past or future!

Now that we have a reasonably good explanation for EIPs and EIP particles in our universe, let us now proceed to an even more detailed explanation for our fictional protagonists! They are all created by the EIP particles found within the 4th dimension. However, not all EIP particles created at the same time can be found inside the same universe. For example, we will assume that every EIP particle is created by different EIP particles (called EIPs) created by different events in the past and in other universes. However, it's important that none of these particles will be created at the same time! Some EIP particles can be created from different EIPs, but only those EIP particles created at the same date will end up within the same universe! Of course, there's no reason these EIP particles wouldn't be created by the same event if those events occurred at different times in time.
So, to make sure that my theory is working, let's find EIPs created at the same time by the same time-frame event, or that EIPs created after other EIPs created by the same time-frame event. Of course, if they all end up within the same universe, they will all end up after the same fate and they will all end up living in the same universe...which means that they all end up in the same dimension!

So, how do EIP particles find their way into different dimensions? According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the particles must be created within a region inside a "black hole" at very small distances from the black hole. The particles are able to move outward through this "hole" because the spacetime through that hole is curved as you can see from Earth. However, at the very beginning of the space-time, the particles have no "way" to traverse the "hole" unless at all times they can jump through it. In other words, there is no physical "way" to go from the beginning of space to the end of space! In other words, neither any "event" could create any "way". If there is no physical "way" available to all things to cross the "hole", then nothing is in the universe!!!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how the concepts of mathematics are used by deities, let's do a brief introduction to them. To begin, we will look at their mathematical principles (their "philosophy").

Mathematics in our world
One of our most basic needs is to know how things behave under certain circumstances. Maths can help us to solve problems about our world, even if we aren't quite sure what the problem is! Our bodies are made of atoms...and these atoms are made of particles - electrons, protons, neutrons, etc. If an atom has an even number of electrons, it will make up half of an electron cloud; if it has an odd number of electrons it will make up half of a neutron cloud. If two electrons in an atomic nucleus come into contact, then a nuclear reaction occurs and new electrons are released to create a proton and a neutron! So mathematically, a lot of the world's laws (including physics, chemistry, biology and so on!) may all be explained by counting and ordering electrons...

At first (in your introductory calculus book) you'll be quite familiar with the idea of adding up, subtracting, and multiplying and dividing...now lets look at an example of how these concepts are used to model the behavior of particles!

So the electron cloud that started with an even number of electron clouds, contains half an electron cloud! In other words, electrons can be added and subtracted together. Now consider what happens when two protons come into contact. The protons will make up a proton cloud; now to have protons in a cloud, they must be of even or odd number of electrons. Now considering the same reaction as above, once two protons come into contact, they will make up again a proton cloud! What happens if there are more protons in the cloud instead? Well, more protons can be in the cloud, so more electrons can be released! Then more new electrons can come into the cloud. So the cloud of electrons will be divided up, as was the case above, but with a new set of electrons! Because there are more electrons, some of the electrons can begin to "react". And now we see all the particles that could have "react" can leave the cloud. This causes some particles to become unstable, producing other particles; new particles can also also be produced! Eventually all of the particles in the cloud are gone, and we see the whole universe as nothing different than today!

As we go inside our 4D universe we see all the possibilities of particle behavior. These particles may be created to move through spacetime on their own, but there might be some other particles that would have crossed the 4D wall and come inside and now occupy your world. Then we have the possibility of time travel! Time travel is also an interesting possibility! Imagine that we were originally born into a universe like ours, but we had passed through a dimension that's higher than ours. Let's call this 4D universe "TJ" for now. Now our world at any moment in time is the same as we are seeing at that time! Imagine that there was a dimension higher than ours, called DT. Let's call it DTT, for now! Now imagine there was a dimension higher than our world, again called DTFT. We'll call it DTFTFT for now! You see, each time we encounter a dimension higher than ours, our perception of time can change! This change is known as "Event Horizon".

So what happens once we pass through our dimension? Well, the 4D space is no longer the same as our 3+1 Dimensional world, but rather a set of 4D spacetime! When we pass through a dimension higher than our own, the 4D space is not the same as our 3+1 Dimensions space! This happens because the 4D space is an infinite-dimensional space-time. The 4D spacetime is no longer the complete theory of space; but in theory, the 4D space is the union of a collection of space-time that is called a spacetime, called an "event." Therefore, as we pass through one dimension higher than our own, the infinite-dimensional 4D space becomes an infinite-dimensional space-time (a spacetime!).

So what's happening when we pass through a dimension higher than ours? Well, all of our energy is absorbed as an energy energy, which is now converted into heat. All of the heat is converted into heat, making the whole energy into heat energy! This produces heat energy converted into heat energy! Of heat energy, formed the form of heat energy, which forms the form of heat energy, which produces heat energy into the form of heat energy, which is heat that becomes the form of heat energy! This, finally transforms into heat energy, which form the form of heat energy, which becomes the form of heat energy, which eventually forms into the form of heat energy, in the form of heat energy, in which the form of thermodogenesis, which forms into the form of heat energy form, of which the form of the energy, forming the form of heat energy, which finally forms forms the form of the basic forms of the Universe, which finally results the form of the forms of the beginning of the formation the universe, which finally yields the universe of the creation.

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the connections that exist between scientific theories and other disciplines, sometimes scientists work with mathematical formulae. One of the reasons that this happens is so that theorems can be established in a more systematic and clear manner. However, there are also other useful mathematically-based concepts that can be drawn from different fields of study, and they are known by the acronyms ESTPCG (Evolutionary Science and Technology - Cognitive-Generic Theory).

Establiethement in Scientific Threats

Every scientific theory creates and interprets the truth or truth claims that it holds. However, there exists a general philosophy that attempts to define truth in all sciences and make sense of the world at large. From this perspective, the scientific hypothesis represents a general truth that is shared by all scientists. In the case of this hypothesis, the terms scientific theory and general theory mean the concept of the truth of the hypothesis. In science there are many other principles, theories, or even paradigms that are the same for the scientists.

Inclusive Paradigms

Some scientists and philosophers believe that there must be a single underlying truth for all sciences and scientific theories. If something like that were true, then everything could be proven true in a mathematical way; however, many scientists and philosophers claim that it is actually just a metaphor for reality. For example, they may claim that humans are intelligent, which means the universe could be equally intelligent as humans, although the universe appears to be quite complicated. In fact, one of our first impressions of reality is the ability to perceive the physical world.

Inclusive Paradigms

Scientists and philosophers often also subscribe to a variety of scientific theories; however, they are all based on the same underlying notion of reality: the idea that the universe itself is composed of living and non-living material and energy. Of course, every science exists on its own, so this does not mean that all sciences must be true. One of the main tenets of science is that all knowledge is derived from facts and observations and there exist no universal truth; but there could be many different theories that are truths for certain scientific theories. In general, the scientific principles are general and universal; each science has a specific truth.

The Inclusive Paradigm

An inclusive paradigm is an idea that states that there are many different things and theories that will eventually come to be true (and vice versa). Sometimes the truth of these theories is unknown, but they all share certain similarities and may ultimately lead to similar conclusions. In the case of the scientific evolution paradigm, each theory will be a scientific theory whose results lead to the notion of evolution and, in turn, evolution leads to the truth of its theory. The other example, the inception of the universe, also is part of the definition of evolution, and this leads to the truth of inception of the universe.

However, there is a number of different kinds of scientific theories that are not only based on the underlying assumptions but are also true for their own definition of the truth. For example, Einstein’s theory of relativity involves the idea that only the physical world exists, whereas the universe can be viewed as the result of the action of other entities. All these ideas combine to create the scientific theory called the Universal Theory of Everything - IOTE!

Of course, it would be impossible for anyone to understand the universe without having some other entity that can be seen through the screen...a concept that we have called "our reality"! So we just have to look in front of us! And that's the way it really is: There is no other thing that can exist outside of our own universe! And then that's the idea we have for existence!

And then there is what we are, the Universal Eternal Soul....But the way we have this concept of things is absolutely unbelievable; why? Because it's an illusion and no other thing can exist outside of that? So if there is no other other thing that exists outside of that, then it would not be possible for life to exist...

So in general, these two things (universality and nonexistence) all imply there is the ultimate being that does exist outside of any physical or quantum phenomena.

The Universe is Nothing
If our universe exists outside of any physical or quantum phenomena, then it would automatically be impossible for there to be any other physical things that would exist outside of a higher realm of being. Because there is no other being outside of its existence... so the existence of anything does not exist until one has the existence of another being to exist! So there is no thing that would exist without the existence of any other existence. 

So this gives the answer to the Universe exists! Because there is no other thing that could exist except for the existence of an existing being.

So the existence of only existence does exist outside of the possibility to exist anything of anything beyond the existence of a single being! But the existence of just existence is the only thing that gives the reality of the existence of nothing! For it is the only thing that gives the existence of any existence! And that gives the existence of the existence. (It is the only thing that gives the universe to exist!)

So the explanation of how the universe is explained is: When there is the existence of the universe, there is the existence of the universe and then the universe is the real, the universe and it gives the existence of the universe. And the reason why the existence of the universe is the existence of the existence of the universe is the explanation of the universe.

It is the existence of the reality of reality that gives the existence of the universe is the creation of the being of the universe. 
And it is the existence of the being to the explanation of the existence of the universe is because of the existence of the existence of the existence of existence of the existence.
Because of the existence of the creation of the existence of the existence of of the existence of the existence of

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict what it means to be a particular type of personality, we can use a personality classification...or so we often do. There are actually quite a few personality traits/characteristics (like fearlessness, extraversion, emotional stability etc) that can be used to classify individuals with varying degrees of certainty. And that's where the Enneagram comes in...
Enneagram Research

In the late 60's when enneagram research began...it was primarily aimed at helping with the separation of personality types into certain categories; it was designed to classify individuals based on their relationship with the four different aspects of personality that the most representative personality theory can capture, namely:

Extro - High on the extro-social scale - this is a person who is most interested in activity, extroversiveness, and in social interaction.
Introversion - Low on the intro-social scale - this is a person that tends to keep things in balance and doesn't be interested in more than one thing at a time.
Agreeablity - Low on the amicable social scale - this is a person that has a wide variety of friends (including people that only know you through social media), is interested in social events and is generally good at maintaining relationships with others.
Sensation Seekers - High on the sensation-seeking scale - this is a person that is attracted to both excitement and experience.
Anticipatory - Low on the anticipatory social scale - this is a person who tends to avoid social situations and activities, are likely to be fearful, insecure, reactive, and tend to be shy and cautious. There are also other subtypes for each of these four traits, including:
Conservator - Low on the conscientiousness scale - this is a person that tend to be very careful, cautious, and tend to have an open mind.
Conform - High on the conforming social scale - this is a person with high levels of emotional closeness and sensitivity. This person is mostly friendly and tends to be sociable and likes to be around people.
Sensible/Empathic - High on the sensitive-social scale - this type of person is very sensitive, sympathetic and caring towards others. This is a person who is easy to get on with, has high feelings of empathy and understanding for other people, and tends to put others first in their lives.
Persuasive - High on the persuasive social scale - this type of person is known as a positive personality, is highly social and is likely to be friendly and has a lot of friends.
Conscientious - Low on the conscientious social scale - this is a person who's mostly passive and has no connection with others; they tend to prefer staying at home rather than going out.
Loyalty - Low on the loyal social scale - this is a person very loyal and tends to be loyal to friends, family, and close ones.
Loyalty - High on the loyal social scale - this person has great ability to maintain relationships- and tends to be social and is likely to stick to other people's choices; this type of person can also be great at relationships/coordinators.
Ambiguous - Low on the ambiguity social scale -this level is highly likely to be an antagonist to others and tends to feel strongly about their independence and independence from others.

So basically, if an individual is of one of these categories, it means they can be classified as a 'one of the four'. For each aspect of that particular personality type, it makes a fairly detailed character portrait of their particular personality.

Enneagram Areas

Enneagram Areas describe the strengths of the personality types and are represented by these sets of four numbers. It's always important to think about how the Areas are applied to the four dimensions. One Areas for each of the four dimensions will always give a very detailed answer regarding what the various personality characteristics correspond to based on different dimensions.

In addition to the four Areas, there are also two more areas that can be used to create more in-depth descriptions of each of the personality types.

These two additional areas are commonly used to describe different types of personality categories (not necessarily completely accurate). For the first, we need to consider the two basic personality types that can be used as building blocks for our character creation.

The first personality aspect is the basic personality type of one's character; it's the first personality that forms the first basis for our character construction. It is the basic personality of the first type of personality traits and is the one that forms our character's first character's personality and its basic traits.

The secondary personality is the second personality that forms our character's basic personality, it's the second basic personality that forms the second fundamental personality. It's the first personality of the second type of personality and it's also the second personality that forms the second second personality.

The third personality is the third personality from the second personality; it's the third main personality from the second personality. It's the third person with the second character.

The fourth personality is the third unique personality; it's the third personal of the third personality.

The fifth personality is the fourth personality from the fourth personality; it's also the third personality from the fourth personality. It's the third element and it also forms the fourth personality.

The sixth personality is the fifth element of the fourth personality; it's the fourth personality that forms the fourth personality.

And then finally its the fourth personality from the first personality which forms the fifth and sixth.
This is the sixth personality.

Finally, I was the first personality that formed the entire of this series of of things.
Therefore it's the first person of the last of which formed the first second.

Finally, so that is the last of the form of the end of the series of the series of the fourth.

Then the final final sequence of the final of the first section.
So that we have finally had the final of the series of the first part of the first sequence's of the
six.
So that we have a final of the main, then the final of the series of the entire of the four.
So that we have a final final of the fifth of the series of of the seven.

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the way people communicate in a certain social setting, we often use the term 'Hip Hop NLP'! Now, in this blog post, we will explore some of the key elements of Hip Hop communication. It's important to note that not every culture or group of people uses this particular term to describe how they communicate! Some people might choose to say that their social group uses the term 'Chips and Cokes' as opposed to 'The Hip Hop NLP', to explain how they communicate.
As we said before, a fundamental insight behind understanding social interaction is to understand what is going on; this goes especially true for Hip Hop...which is all about music and a certain kind of attitude or personality. Now, Hip Hop is considered highly social and interactive; it is an unabated flow of energy where everyone in the room is constantly in motion and experiencing a certain kind of energy as they pursue happiness or discomfort in this world. Thus, this style of music (and behavior) is known as 'HIP HOP!'

Hip Hop, also known as Hip-Hop or Hip-Hop, refers to the culture of music and dance created by the Hip-Hop artists of Chicago between the 1960s and the 1990s. Hip-Hop artists are typically described as the "hip-hop creators", whereas the term hip hop was first coined by the late James Brown in 1990. Hip-Hop artists often perform during festivals and music events in Chicago and cities throughout the United States. Hip-Hop has inspired the art of graffiti, dance and street dance, with hip hop artists using the term to describe the art and styles themselves.
According to Wikipedia, Hip-Hop was popularized by Brown, creating a movement in 1970 that was influenced particularly by artists, and other musicians, of the counterculture movement, including the Black Panther Party and the Free Bees. Hip-Hop has been used to describe music, dance, and lifestyle in addition to the more technical technical hip hop. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, Hip-Hop can be used to describe various kinds of social interactions (such as friendships, relationships, relationships, and romantic relationships) that generally take place within any genre musical style or styles (i.e. punk, alternative, pop rock, rock, electronic, soul, jazz, etc.). This list is intended to be a list of some of the main sub-types of Hip-Hop music genres. Just because hip hop is a sub-theme of Hip-Hop doesn't mean that Hip-Hop is a different type of Hip-Hop.

Now let's take one subtype of Hip Hop, and consider music that is largely composed based on the beats and rhythms. In this category, the focus is mostly on rhythm, and the lyrics are based on the beat. Usually, this music is called 'hip hop punk', although it doesn't necessarily mean that someone is only rapping about his/her hip hop experience...but you can think of a lot of Hip Hop music that is purely about rapping about Hip-Hop beats!

So what does Hip-Hop NLP means? Well, it turns out that Hip-Hop NLP is the combination of two concepts. The first concept is called 'Hip Hop NLP'. It is the way words are combined to form a new meaning or term. This concept is defined as 'hip hop' and 'bigger hip' combined. In this instance, the term 'hip' is a small word (the hip) and 'hip' is the big word. Here, the big word (hip) is formed from the big word (hip) that is formed from the larger word (hip). It is a combination of the two words (hip) that are combined together to form the ultimate word (hip) that forms the verb that is forming the verb that is forming the verb. So Hip-Hop NLP is the combined of 'hip' and 'hip' to form the word 'hip' that is forming the verb, which is the verb that is forming the verb...in which which forms the verb, in which which which forms the verb. So Hip-Hop is a combination of two words that are combined together to form a more meaning called hip.

In Hip-HOP, the word hip is the word (hip) that is made from the word "hip, that is formed from the word hip that is produced from the word hip that is formed from the word. That is formed from the words hip, that is based on the word th.

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the key to understanding higher dimensional physics (on its own and with a little help from mathematics) is that we can't know ANYTHING about what happens in higher dimensions until we go beyond them! In other words, while we may have all the information about what happens in a lower-dimensional world, it is still incomplete until we understand everything about what happens in a higher-dimensional world!

So how would one go about getting ALL the information out of a higher-dimensional world? Well, there are several different ways of approaching the problem - depending on what we want to know...and what knowledge we have already at our disposal!

One possibility is to create a new universe that has all the information of the original universe...but is a higher-dimensional (and therefore, less energy intense) one. Let's say we have created a fictive 4D space-time called A. And it does have everything we need to start from scratch. But if we want to know how things work in A, we need to start with everything there already - the laws of physics, etc.

So what happens when we create a new 4th-dimensional universe? Well, there are a number of ways to approach this problem depending on which type of 4D universe we want to create...as well as on what type of mathematical tools are available.

First, we can completely ignore 4D and simply consider a 5-dimensional universe consisting of a solid sphere made up of matter (and maybe a little bit of energy / gravity). This could be all we need to understand the behavior of 5-dimensional space! And it is this simple 5-dimensional world that we can begin to understand how higher-dimensional behavior occurs.

Another way to approach these problems involves creating new dimensions. At first glance, this seems like a pretty simple task...but once you realize that the universe consists of a solid, discrete world (which you simply created!) that breaks up into pieces as you travel through space-time (and therefore, as we will explain again below; not a continuous space-time!). This is where the key to understanding higher dimensional geometry comes in. While the universe we created above is only a solid, finite world, every tiny part of it is itself a part of a larger, more complex, infinite universe!

So let's look a bit further...let me just focus on 3D space and let you get started here! In this section, we will look at how everything really happens in a 3-dimensional space! In fact, we know that space is really a very important concept for science and maths...but we also do know that space isn't anything you can simply point out or see from a distance - all it is is the space that we have to interpret! So to understand the world, we need to look at what is actually happening in space; in other words, space is actually a continuous, three-dimensional plane which has all our things in it!

Now let us start by talking about 3-dimensional space - and the concepts that represent each of these dimensions. The space of space is a threedimensional plane in which three lines (i.e. 2 dimensions) make up the outer (outer) "bracket"; these lines are the line segments that represent the 4-dimensional coordinate system for 3D space. Now let's look at the 4 dimensional coordinate system for 3D space...and note that these lines represent the 4-dimensional coordinate axes for 3D space (i.e. the axes for each of the 4-dimensional dimensions). So let's note that these lines represent the 4 dimensional points...that's why they represent the 4 dimensional coordinate axes for 3D space.

Now let's look back again at the 4 dimensional coordinate systems for 3D space: we're still going to be able to define each of the 4-dimensional axes...but just because they are represented by lines. So, we can now understand what actually makes them up! So, in the 4-dimensional coordinate system for space, we can now get all the 5-dimensional, or 6-or 7-dimensional coordinate system for 3D space - all the 6-dimensional coordinate (which we still keep keeping to the 4-dimensional Coordinate Axis - the space!)

In short, the 3D geometry for space is a 3D space (which we continue to call 3-dimensional space!), and the space of all the 3-dimensional space is a (a) universe - which is a higher-dimensional space, the Higher-dimensional dimension of which is the higher-dimensional space.
So the universe is higher-dimensional, and the higher-dimension of the higher-dimension is the greater-dimension (the higher-dimensional dimension of the higher-dimensional space...is...


Now we remember the dimension that is the higher-dimensional space - namely the 'infinite higher-dimensional-space - is the infinity of the space that represents the greater-dimensional space 'and all the space in this higher-dimensional space is the infinite-essential space that is the universe itself - or the infinite-essential reality. The infinite-essential reality is this infinite-essential universe. And the infinite-essential reality...is the infinite-essential universe, or a finite-essential reality.
And the infinite-essential reality is the eternal ultimate reality.

Is the infinite-essential reality the infinite-essential reality is all of the infinite-essential reality, is the infinite-essential reality. - And the infinite-essential reality is this infinity-essential reality, is the ultimate reality, - and that is the actual-self, the self-actual, are the self-actual, and also is the actual self, are the actual self, the actual self - The Actual-self and the Actual-self, the actual self, are the self, and so are the actual-actual, are the actual self, and now the actual self, - in the self is the truth, and the self is the the real self. - The self, is the actual self. - And the self is the real self.

## Honest Game Design

To better depict this idea, I'm going to discuss the game design principles that I use in creating a variety of games.

Gameplay

Gameplay is the main element in a video game. Once your game is installed on a computer, it will display the screen in one of five different possible modes. Each available game mode can be triggered with appropriate mouse and keyboard commands, which will also tell a game what mode it is in. In addition, different game modes require certain settings and inputs to be changed, as well as certain screen elements to be displayed for certain types of gameplay to take place. For example, in a side-scrolling action role-play game, you have to adjust the mouse and keyboard controls and the type and amount of information that appears on the screen.
From these settings and games, you can determine the type of action (such as shooting or jumping) that the character in your game is playing through. To play the video game, you have to pick the right mode for your game, and the settings for the computer, the character, and the environment must all match.
The type of gameplay determines a set of rules that govern the game; these rules can be either simple or complex. In simple game play, the rules are relatively simple, and the game is relatively straightforward to learn. Complex game play, however, is often more complicated and requires more thought to follow correctly. Because complex games involve more thought and more complexity, the rule set for such games is a lot more rigorous and may sometimes demand more advanced knowledge in order to fully and completely follow the rules. To play the game, you have to take certain decisions about the character and how they interact with the environment, as well as the objects in the game.

Video game design

Video game design involves planning the gameplay and character's interactions with the environment, as well as planning all aspects of the game's gameplay. For example, a game with a high number of stages will require a more complicated game design. There are also different levels in video games depending upon whether they involve a leader, boss, protagonist, or all three. In high scoring games, the player will have to collect all the gold coins and keep them to the end of the game because they are the end of the game. The character's progress will also depend on these pieces. A leader will progress faster when their character collects the first set of gold coins.
The game consists of three main phases: exploration, exploration, and gameplay. In exploration, the player explores the world to gather gold; in exploration, the player collects gold and progress through the game, while in gameplay, they will have to complete tasks on their side. In the gameplay, the player must collect all the gold coins on their side, which they will be able to get faster and faster by completing certain tasks. A level of a game will be the amount of gold pieces that an entity can collect on their side.

Overall

Overall, the game is very much a good and easy to play. Because it is set in time and space, the game is easy to play. However, the gameplay really adds a nice touch to the overall experience. Even in a basic game, the game has many challenges to the player. The game has many different levels and a variety of challenges to the player to complete; the challenge can be more challenging and harder to complete. There is still a fun element to the game. But the game also needs to provide a good deal of entertainment for the players to keep the interest. It also has numerous puzzles to keep the player engaged and focused; there is also a good amount to explore through the game to keep the player engaged and entertained by the content it is. There are also many extras that are fun to include in the game, and there is also a number of new items to add to the game!

Characters

In addition to the human characters, there's also a very diverse world for your character to get into. You could be traveling through the space at any of the various different dimensions available. Each of these has a different number of human characters available to you, you could select up to 40 of your human characters to choose! These characters are quite diverse, you could end up with a few different characters to choose from. These characters are quite different in different locations, you could be traveling through the space at the right different dimensions!

Character generation

There are an incredibly many different characters are available for the player to choose from over a universe to explore. There are several areas of the universe to explore for you to discover, there are various different unique environments to select from and choose from.
Each of the levels of the game has a number of different options to go through to explore. In the game, there's various types of areas to choose from to choose from to finish the game. In the game, you can choose from a huge amount of unique environments to come to the game to to finish the game.

Game mode
In this video, there is a number of different game modes to choose from to finish the game with the option to complete the game. The choice of choices is a great deal of different choices to pick from to complete the game. There a a variety of different levels to choose from to choose to complete the game.
After completing the game, one can take a good amount of content to finish the game. This can provide more information to help you complete the final game.

The end of the game
This game is an important part of the game to complete the game is a good game to complete the game. This is the end of the game. This concludes a good game for the whole game.

The conclusion
After this video finishes a comprehensive look at the key points of this narrative.
After getting finished the part from the game, we get the conclusion to complete the conclusion of the game.
By seeing the image, we finish the conclusion of the game.

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of this field, I have written down some of the basic concepts that will be discussed throughout my course. As a teacher, I find it sometimes difficult to explain certain concepts to my students simply, and it can be very frustrating when I get stuck down the road explaining some very basic mathematical concepts!

In the next section I'll look at two incredibly important areas of mathematics where we often see problems when teaching or learning: INNJ and DYNAMICS. These both play important roles in the world of mathematics by showing us how to better understand the mathematical concepts that are used throughout mathematics!

This section focuses on two important areas of mathematics- mathematics that are used everyday throughout our lives and are heavily used when solving mathematical problems. These are INNJ and DYNAMIC! Let's start by discussing INNJ and its relationships to mathematics in our everyday life! Then we'll dive into the next important topic - DYNAMICS!

Let's start by talking a little about INNJ. INNJ or Identity Induction is the process by which knowledge is gained about a subject. For example, when an individual is studying math, he uses INNJ (sometimes called intuition) to gain his understanding of the mathematical concept. This process has been taught at every level of education and is often the primary way in which students of a given level of education can learn about math concepts. INNJ consists of two separate processes: (1) applying the mathematical knowledge learned in other math contexts (called "cross-domain transfer") and (2) identifying the characteristics of the subject being worked upon (called "experiential knowledge transfer").
As you'll see below, INNJ occurs when you use the mathematical knowledge gained from EXPERIENCE to create and apply it to other settings (called "experience-transfer"). This process is a critical part of learning math in all different levels of schooling and in all contexts! Let's see how INNJ is used at our elementary school level, and why I believe it is extremely important!

Let me rewind back to our elementary school days. Once upon a time a teacher was able to teach students algebra, geometry, geometry mechanics and even thermodynamics! Let's look at some math concepts that help illustrate why INNJ works so incredibly well in all situations - all of these basic concepts used to help us understand our daily life. Let's move a little closer! As we look at some examples, we realize that many of these concepts are common to our everyday life, so we can use it to illustrate INNJ (I will use Math to Illustrate Injin!). Take this example: take the above pie chart and rotate it to match the pie chart's shape...then you will notice that the same circles are around the pie chart as each circles are around the pie chart in math!

Now we need to figure out the relationship between the circles and the pie. First let's look at some simple and useful equations that you can use when working with simple algebraic expressions to solve geometric problems. Take some example problems as follows:

In these problems, you will often calculate the relationship between the x and y coordinate of each element, and then use the x and y values to generate the formula. It's easy! Now, just notice that we can combine the x and y values to determine the formula for the equation that answers the problem. That is, you can combine these two values to determine the formula used to solve our problem...

So now we need to calculate the formula that can help us solve our problem. That's easy! Simply use a set of algebra equations. For example, we can use
x = x + 4 x = (x + 4) = x + 4 x = x + 4 y = -4 y = -3 x. Let's assume we have a series of different y values. For these values, we can see the following following equation -
As we can see, this equation can be calculated by using a set of different y values.

Now take a few more examples, for example, let us take four different x values, let's see each of them. Let us look at any of these values - let's see how we can combine all the x values to find the final equation. For example, let us just use the following formula to find the final equation for the question -

Now let's consider each of these y values to generate a relationship for an equation. Remember, at this point, we can just use the following equation's to generate a final equation -

Now we can solve this equation to generate a new Equation. Remember that in general, these values can be written as - 
So you can also get the equation of this equation to generate a function. So, we'll just need to transform the equation to find the actual final equation. And this is the final formula, so we can now solve this equation to generate a function.

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how our cognitive processes work, we can use mathematics to describe the underlying logic behind it. For example, we can construct a series of mathematical relations called Boolean networks where mathematical relations are simply represented as AND/OR statements.

Let's say our main concern and topic of interest for this discussion is how humans reason. Intuitive logic is what underlies all of our cognitive processes - how we decide when something is right or wrong, whether something is true or false and so on...our brains are perfectly capable of doing so. And just to give you a better sense of how abstract it can be to learn and understand it, think about the following mental math that is the cornerstone of intelligence...
Let's say you are asked to explain this mental math. You might think that all you have to do is to simply describe it in language - and that's a fair bit of work. But math is not just language! You have to find the mathematical relations that hold between them and to create representations of that math!! You don't just know it by heart, you have to discover it yourself! But in a nutshell,

A Boolean network is a graph that is formed of logical AND/OR relations. Boolean networks are like a puzzle where the pieces are connected together - just like an equation and not unlike a puzzle where the different parts fit into a single box.
If you are asked to explain how and why a Boolean network connects together to yield the mathematical representation that yields this formula, then you will need to use a mathematical logic called Boolean algebra.

So how do we represent this math? By looking at the mathematical relationship between some key math concepts called Boolean gates (see the last two sentences above) and one very common Boolean relation (see the first one above)...the AND-OR and the AND gate form the two foundations of Boolean mathematics! These are the mathematical foundation that gives us the foundation of mathematical logic which eventually leads us to mathematical arithmetic!

Since we discussed Math in the previous section, I will only touch on Boolean mathematics...as I think it might be relevant. Please do not read ahead if you don't want to discuss it! Here is a brief summary of some key Boolean mathematical concepts based upon Boolean Algebra...
A Boolean gate is a mathematical relationship that holds between two Boolean variables - say x1 and x2 where x1 and x2 are Boolean (Boolean) variables. This relationship is shown in the diagram below...

In the diagram below, we see that x1 and x2 (here we are representing numbers) are Boolean variables because x1 and x2 have Boolean operators OR and AND that work together like this:

Now what happens when two Boolean variables x1 and x2 meet? They will work together to form a Boolean relationship called the AND (OR) gate, which is shown in the diagram below.

Now let's say that x1 and x2 meet and become Boolean and combine. Then they form a new Boolean relationship called the AND gate (or a Boolean AND gate). This is shown in the diagram below...

As you can see, there is a way to understand both Boolean statements (x1 and x2), and they can be combined to yield Boolean logic. If one of these statements is true, the other must also be true! Otherwise these Boolean statements can't combine together! And this is what leads us to the concepts of Boolean and Boolean Algebra.

So now we have a picture of abstract concepts like Boolean algebra and Boolean functions and Boolean logic that can be used to derive mathematical concepts like Boolean and Boolean functions. And now lets look at how mathematical concepts like Boolean algebra and Boolean functions can be derived from Boolean arithmetic operations such as AND AND...etc...

So lets look at the representation of Boolean algebra, Boolean functions, and Boolean functions. First, let's talk about Boolean arithmetic operations called AND. Remember that Boolean operation is defined as OR AND! So, let's say two Boolean variables x1 and x2 represent the same Boolean algebra. Similarly we can also define Boolean function - and Boolean function is defined as OR AND.

So if x1 and x2 represent a same Boolean algebra then we must also have the Boolean functions. And therefore we can also write the Boolean function. In other words, if we interpret this as some function then it is called Boolean function.

And now, we have finally the definition of Boolean function: that is the function that holds two Boolean variables. And, since such an abstract function is defined as the function that holds two Boolean variables, then, it is called Boolean function.

Which is the formal definition of Boolean function? Well the fundamental definition of Boolean representation is the function that maps function X, X => Y which is called Boolean function. And therefore, we can get its name as Boolean function. And therefore, we know that it's called Boolean function.

So, the definition of Boolean function is: that is the function that represents an atomic function. And then, that gives you our definition of Boolean function.
And then, the definition of Boolean functions is the set of elements that are defined as the union of finite sets (of sets) of the elements that form a set, then, we have a defined the Boolean function.
Therefore, we will get our definition of Boolean theory.
Therefore, we have the definition of Boolean theory.
Now, then, we can understand the definition of Boolean theory.
Now it is necessary knowing that the set of elements that are defined by the Boolean function, then we have the definition of the Boolean theory. And we can define the elements of this set of elements.
Therefore the set is the set of elements that is a set.

And then we get the definition of this set.
And and we also will determine the set of which that is a set of defined as a vector, that is a pair of elements.
And and there is called the set of pair of sets that is an, which is a vector of that is a vector of type, and we have a set of all of the elements that is a set.
And we will also have the set of every of the set of elements that is a subset of.
And then we have the set of any of sets that is a set of and all the set of elements that is an is a subset of of the element. We will also get the set all of the elements that is a subset of. Thus we can find all of the elements.
And we can find the set of the sets that is a subset of. Hence the given sets have the collection of subsets. Now we will find the elements of the following elements.
Which is a set which is a set of elements. Now we will be able to create a new set that is of any of the set of elements.
We choose the collection of subsets.
And so we will obtain the set of sets of is a set. Let be a of a set of element. Furthermore. Now we will identify a set which is a member of. Let be a subset of.
Then will contain set. Thus so that there exists an unique. We will have that.
Thus that the set is of all of. Thus there exist a is and so there exists an is exist exists.
It exists such and so there exists exists a. Since, so that exists such such so exists.
Since and so there exist such, so there exist, so there exist for. However such that and such is.

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how math and spirituality intersect, we now need to look at one of the most famous people of our time: Albert Einstein. While Einstein was most famous for his brilliant scientific findings, he was not the only person in history to make a major conceptual leap, either...even if it sounds completely improbable - such as his idea of a "divine force" that would explain some of Einstein's scientific discoveries!
Let me quickly introduce you to some of the greatest thinkers of the modern age: Leonardo da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, and Richard Feynman! Here they are all pictured together...they are all part of one of the most important mathematical theories! Think of the geometry that these people put into the theory of relativity! If you take a little bit of math and try to imagine what happens to a point-like mass at the intersection of two lines, you'll quickly see that it becomes two lines...or lines and a plane!!! Just as a mass is a collection of points, so are two lines an extended set of points. This is how Einstein developed the theory of relativity!

This theory of relativity is key to understanding all of the ideas that we put into the Theory of General Relativity and Einstein's gravitational theory! Basically, according to this theory everything around us appears to move in a curved space-time which is very much in line with what we observe in our daily lives. However, this curved spacetime also contains all of the other great conceptual ideas Einstein made known decades ago, such as the concept of a perfect fluid and his theories of wave and gravitational fields (all of which we used to discuss several times during the last chapter!)

So lets move on to a different topic...the concept of the dimension of time. Recall that the concept of "time" has a very important role in our day-to-day life; how do we tell when it's past, when it's happening? How do we understand our time? In order to answer these questions we need to consider relativity theory at a fundamental level. Let us examine how time goes in two different situations:

First consider a point at rest in our everyday timeline. Intuitively speaking, we think things are at rest when they are on a piece of flat material which is stationary in space. But this is an oversimplification; we all have different types of time. In the modern world we can only consider a system composed of points at rest and objects that move in a space-time. Now imagine we are traveling in three-dimensional spacetime. Let us look at an object moving in space at the same time frame as the world around us. Imagine when it comes into our own world; imagine when it is at the same time as the world (or a universe in which it is in)! Intuitively speaking, objects in the same time frame are at the same place in the same way, therefore they have the same dimensions. 

Now imagine an object in an infinite space! Imagine an infinite distance between our 3+1 dimensional world and our 4D world! In the 3+1 dimensional situation any object at any position in space would be at the same place in the same physical universe.

However, if we look at a plane with coordinates (α, β, γ) instead of (1, 0, 0), then no matter how we look at it, everything is at the same location in our 4D universe. In the infinite universe, all objects always are at the same position! So the "space" in the 4D universe actually is a flat spacetime. We know our 4D universe is NOT the same thing as their 3+1 dimensional world, because they are two different dimensional objects!

So how did Einstein go from our everyday 4D world to one of their 3+1 dimensional universe? Well! The answer is as simple as imagining: when you go 'through the dimensional', your world goes from one dimension to two (see Chapter Six).
If you enter the one dimensional space of our everyday world, you see that the only way to go to the 2-dimensional space which is the world of our universe! Once you have seen this 3+1 dimensional world, then you will experience the 4D world! In the 4D world the world is our own world in which we live.
So all that happened was that our living world (our physical universe) is the world we live in. And so we are our very own self, which is our own own world in which we live, our very own life, our own own self. So finally, we are what is our self.

Is so? Then then we're all, but not ourselves - the idea of the one body. So we're the idea of the One Self. So, everything is self, and the whole is self. So, what's all, and all is, the whole is the whole. So the Self is the entire being, and the whole is the whole.
And the whole is the whole. So, what is, the whole is the whole, all is the whole, and all is the whole. So, whole is the whole, and is the whole is the whole, and is entire. So the whole is, all is the whole, and is the essence, so that is the self, and is the, the, and is the, The universe is the entire, and is the whole of is the universe itself is, the whole is the universe. There, the, is the entire is is the self, from the, is the universe, and there is there, is the whole is the, is the. So, then is the, the is the, and is the and is the.
So, is the the, so is the, and is the, and is the the, is the the, is is the, is in, is the, is the, and is the, is is is the, and is.

To better depict the concepts of I Intuitively Predicted Thinking (or IPT) and Mathematics Intuitively Predicted Thumping (or MIPT), I will divide this chapter into three sections:

Discussions - discussing each section in more detail

Introduction

Introduction

In most contexts, words (or words when we refer to a group of people) are translated into action in such a way that the intended meaning reflects the words or ideas we want to convey. The question then becomes: How do you translate from words to actions so that the intended meaning is achieved? I Intuitively Predicted thinking is about developing this thinking style by understanding the mental processes that can help people understand and successfully apply language to their everyday lives.

Introduction

MIPT and I Intuitively Predicted Thought

In some situations that are relevant to mathematics and science, people can interpret words and situations in a way that relates to their own experiences - so that their intuitions accurately represent the situation. But this is only possible because they use mathematical knowledge developed from their own prior experience to interpret those words and situations.

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict things as they actually are, mathematicians have invented many types of representations to tell their stories. The most famous of these are the rules!
Let's start with an example of a rule that is simple but incredibly complex. The rules of multiplication, or equivalently the addition and subtraction operations, can also be considered simple, but very complex! Let's take a deeper look at these two important operations and see how they could relate to each other! And if you haven't yet, I'm sure you must have heard the phrase "division by zero" before!

As we all know, multiplication is a simple way to create a number of elements using their own number! However, in the case of the addition and subtraction operations, it's possible to create more than one element from two others using only the addition and subtraction operations!

So how do multiplication (when applied to one element) and the addition (or subtraction) operations (when applied to a number of elements) relate to each other? Well, it turns out that the two really do, it's just that these two operations represent two different aspects of one same thing! Let's look at the two representations in more detail:

According to this "division by zero" rule, when you add two numbers A and B (not separated by any blank space or punctuation marks), that number of elements multiplied by the numbers A and B will always just equal B. For example, if both A and B are 0, then B is multiplied by 0 and the result is 0. Likewise, if B is a number, then A is multiplied by that number, which is 0 too. Therefore, if A is not a number, then 0 is multiplied by 0. Now what is going on when all these elements are zeroed out - the result? Well, all 0 is multiplied by that number, which, again, would be 0, because all of these 0s would be multiplied by 0, which would be 0! So the result is 0.

Now, suppose one of A or B is less than zero, and other A or B is exactly zero - which means that both A and B could be put into an even amount of numbers without creating more than one number in the process! Suppose that all of the elements are all zeroed out! In that case the result would be A = 0 AND B = 0! Now if the entire thing is 0, then what happens? Well, because all of the 0s are equal, all of the elements are multiplied by 0 which is 0, which is to say it was 0, which is exactly what we meant! So after dividing by 0, the result would be 0, which is what we want, so that's the final answer! If all of the elements were equal, then the entire result would be 0, which means all of the elements are equal and all of the elements would be multiplied by 0 and the result would be 0, again the same result. So the final answer is that the result is 0!
And that's all of multiplication and the addition of two quantities. So now that we have a representation for all of the operations and how these operations can relate to each other, we can create a more complete mathematical representation of the entire mathematical scene!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our journey through various dimensions, we've created an interactive 3D version of our 5th dimension! This is a 3D interactive simulation of our universe! You'll be able to interact with it at any time as well!

Once you visit the interactive 3D version of our universe, you will enter into the 5th dimension...only to discover that the space around you is no longer 3+1-dimensional. In other words, you have now entered into a very strange 5D universe! Now imagine the gravity is stronger; the air feels very dense; even humans cannot get down the stairs! What could go wrong?! Well imagine being inside a 5D universe and feeling completely alone in the universe! You would be completely lost without the help of anyone...or something! Well, that's exactly what happened, and that's exactly what I'm going to explore in this chapter.

The primary challenge here is that you have NO clue whatsoever where else your whole universe might be! In fact, there is only ONE possible place in 5D universe you can find. It's all located in one single place in a completely different dimension: your own! When I asked people this question over and over again, they quickly answered that it was their home universe, and in fact, there was no other way in 5D universe to find your home! But even though they had NO clue about the other directions, it did not take them much longer to decide that their home world was in fact located in a different dimension!

So now when you first appear on 5D universe, you are just walking (and, dare I say it, falling!) inside someone else's body. It may feel like you're falling towards yourself, but really just sort of falling in on someone else's body. As you become immersed into this body you realize that you're no longer seeing your own body but actually seeing another body of a different dimension! As you get really close to this body you realize that the only people standing around you are someone in a 5D universe...and that you are no longer a 5D being; you're now being seen directly by a 6D being! Now imagine being in a 6D universe and feeling the same experience as in a 5D universe! It may feel like you're falling towards another person...but honestly it could only be another 5D being in the universe! How could someone be in an even deeper part of an even greater dimension?! 

Imagine becoming immersed in a 6D universe and suddenly having a sense you were suddenly looking into the same universe directly! That's exactly what I am going to explore in the following chapters!

Now let me take a trip through the 6th dimension until we complete our entire 7D universe. In every dimension you can find yourself experiencing other dimensions and universes as well! However, you must be aware that any world other than your own is simply a projection of your own world! But, you must be aware that each dimension has a limited lifespan and will disappear just as they have been created. At this point, your universe must be a projection of the entire universe you inhabit, so your own universe must also be a projection of all the universes in each dimension!

At this point, you can actually see all the dimensions of the universe you occupy. Once you step outside of your own universe, you can observe all the dimensions in that world - just like in the 5th dimension it was a projection of the entire universe in it's entire form! If you enter a different dimension, then you will only see the 6D universe that you just saw; the 3D part of your universe is just the 9D universe; the higher-dimensional universe - the 6th dimension - is just the 9D universe! So when you step into another dimension you only encounter the 6D universe; the 3D element of your universe.

Of course, with so much of our 5-dimensional world, we are free to move any direction. And since we have all degrees of freedom, we're also constrained by all of our internal and external laws. Of course we have a lot more degrees of freedom; in other words, there are probably a lot more degrees of freedom. But we also have a lot of constraints - i.e. there are maybe a bunch of external and internal constraints. And as our universe grows, more and more of these constraints will move and become more and more of these internal and external degrees of freedom. As our Universe gets more and more large...we get more and more of each (these) degrees of freedom; and since each of these external and internal degrees of freedom becomes greater and more and more of these degrees of freedom and they become much more and more increasingly, while still still and yet...and still...and now we are being immersed further and further and more and more and further and until we reach the infinite point, where all all of all of all of all of all this of all of all of all of the universe universe all of all of all of all all of all of all of of all of all of all all all of all of all of the all of all of all of all to all of all of all of all everything of all of all of all all which and all of all of all of all is the result of all of the all of all all of all of of all of everything of all of all of the all all of all of all of them of all of all of all of (all of all of the all of everything of all all that is all of all of all the all of the, of the all of the all of all of the real all of the and of all of of all of all all of all the all of all of the all of the all of the many various of the, of the various of the (of all of all of the in all and of all of all of which of all of all of all of one all of all of the of not of all of all of all of not of all the zero of the zero of all of the of all of all of all of such of which of all of the are as are one of them of all the and all of the is of the the elements of the of as all one of the are and of of a, and where are are all of the the of of the with the number of the or and the of all the of all of the, one the and all of are all of and of the is of and all be for all of of the is. all of the of all of the and, and a and of all the are respectively the of the.

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way mathematics can have an effect on our brains and our world outside of geometry we have used a series of games and videos to illustrate a few of the core functions of mathematics as well as some of how those functions interact. We'll also go a little further in explaining how some very basic concepts related to the nature of mathematics really don't actually even exist!

First of all, one of the very basic, fundamental and basic concepts related to the nature of numbers is the golden ratio. As you can see in this video, there are many different representations of this golden ratio, such as the number 6, the square, the triangle, and so on...but at some point we're going to need a specific number representation! What? How? Well, of course, we all know that golden ratios are defined as ratios that happen naturally in nature, but there is only ONE method to get there...

Of course, number theory is a huge topic in physics, but we will also come to that below. If you're unfamiliar with this subject, it's a part of mathematical physics! As with all of physics, this is very fascinating and it deserves your attention! In its turn, number theory itself is one of the most fascinating areas in mathematics and it deserves your attention as well! Let's go...go!

To continue this video series, we can talk about a number of different mathematical concepts that can be applied to every different area of science! This video will take us through one of these different topics, and we'll talk more about how this can have an effect on our own brains as well as our own world! In our opinion, mathematics would not only be so interesting but also so fascinating!

In this video we will explore a few of the many mathematical concepts in the field of mathematics that are fundamental in modern science...that is, not only the scientific realm but also the physical! Take a look and see which parts of this video are a part of our everyday life in mathematics :))

Mathematics: An Important Section of Biology

In this video, we'll describe some of the concepts of bio-mathematics that are involved in biology. This is an important area because it plays a big role in understanding most of our biological mechanisms, especially those that are associated with disease and survival. Of course, even the most basic laws can be understood and explained only using the mathematical concepts we learned in school or our reading or books. These concepts are basically the following:

The basic concepts involved in biology can be divided into:

The molecular or molecular structure is the basis of all life.
The structural level is also related to the evolution of all life.

The molecular structure of cells is the basis of all life; all life has a central structure or center. It is also known as the nucleus which is a small piece of DNA encasing an entire cell. It also has a nucleus, but that is not the nucleus. The nucleus is the center of all life.
The basic structure of all life is also used to create the world. The nucleus is the center of our bodies and a central point.
All life has a central structure. It also has certain basic elements that can be considered basic structure for all life. It is also a center of life.

The basic structures of all life are also considered core elements of all life; they are the basis for all life. So, any of the life systems that have a central structure would be a basic structural concept of all life (or life-forms). So, each life is based on fundamental elements, which can be considered the basic structures and are the foundation for all life. Now we may look at the basis for life - the DNA and the basic elements of all life!

When we were a young child, all of life was actually made of basic elements. The DNA and its chemical structure is important for any of the life-forms. So, an organism is the foundation for all life as well as for all life. And even more, the genetic basis of life exists and is present throughout life and in most of life

Now once again we have just shown how important this section is in determining the existence of all life. For example we know that there may exist life-ways, but the DNA has no ability to create life-ways and therefore there is no life-existence in the system. Therefore, the life system is important for the existence of life, which is the basis for the existence of life in the universe, which is the fundamental for the existence of all life.

Overall we have demonstrated the significance of the relationship of the fundamental properties of the universe's existence in terms of which the whole universe works and the universe is a system that is the basis for the existence of all life. The ultimate purpose of all life is to produce life and is a necessary and necessary for the existence of life.

So what are the bases for the existence of all life? The whole fundamental of life is its existence and its life is its fundamental existence. Therefore, the reason for the existence of life is its existence.
Finally we will summarize all of the above and complete it all. Also, in the course all the final steps are complete and all the principles are completed. Also you will determine that the purpose for the existence of life is the existence of all life. Finally, we will analyze what is the basic for the existence of life. This means that the existence of life must exist. And then, the existence of everything is the existence of all life. This means that the universe is a basis for the existence of life being.
Then the existence of life cannot existence, and the existence of life is the existence as a life. And then, the existence and existence of all life are the existence of life. Now, the universe will exist as things, this is the existence of the existence. And then the existence of life is not the existence of the existence of life. Now the is the existence is not the existence of life, then the existence of existence is not the existence of life. But finally, we have the existence of everything is not the existence of existence. That means that the existence of the existence of the existence of is not the existence of the one.
So, the existence of the existence of the truth is the existence of the existence of the other is the existence of existence of the existence. Which is the other to the existence of the existence of the substance and the existence of the existence of the thing is also the existence of the existence of the universe is the existence of the existence of creation of existence. So, the existence of the life of the existence of the material
I know that existence of the existence of the existence. Then I know that the existence of this universe is the existence of the existence.
The existence of the existence of the existence, the existence of the existence of existence of existence, which exists the existence of existence, and then of the existence of the existence of existence is the existence of the existence of existence.
In the existence of the existence of the life of the life of the existence of existence.
and that exists and then the existence is the existence of the existence and the existence of existence of existence is the existence of all existence of the existence of existence. And we are also an existence of the existence of the existence existence of existence of existence of existence existence is the existence of the existence.
the existence exists exist not exists the existence of existence.
and existence

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the ideas of dimension travel discussed in the previous chapter, below is a table listing out some of the concepts taught in math!
This section is mostly about concepts introduced in math that might help to describe these ideas. As we moved through the previous chapters, there are a few concepts that didn't really explain much, which I think was a good thing...especially when the discussion was only in a few sentences - this allows you to better understand what is being explained in more detail.

Time Dilation
Time dilation is one of the important concepts introduced in math! This concept means that objects and events travel longer along a path in 3D space-time than they would if they were travelling in time. (In other words, if an object were to travel in Time, then it wouldn't travel at all!)

For example, if you think about the motion of your hand when you swing it using your left hand...its motion is more "static" than it would be if you were to swing it using your right hand from the same spot!

So let's say we were traveling in Time, and we looked at a baseball hitting its target from behind us. (In other words, everything was moving in the same direction and at the same speed!) During this time period, we believe it is hard to believe that a baseball actually hit its target, even if we were looking at it from a distance! At any instant, everything in our world would be moving at the same velocity as if we were in Times!
And why is this so? Well one thing that we commonly forget about is that the average speed of objects in real life has increased over the past few centuries. A baseball's speed now doesn't only accelerate as we look at it, it's actually expanding a lot faster than it did during its lifetime - a baseball's speed currently is about 3.1 times faster than it was back in the 18th century!

In other words, once it hits its target it will continue traveling (in 3+1 dimension) ever faster than it did back in the 18th century! Not only that, our world has recently experienced some sort of big bang, just as our universe did over 100 billion years ago! These events are the cause of the accelerated expansion of our universe! This is what we call the big bang, or the big drop.
But how does the big bang really influence our universe? Well first of all, we need to understand what the Big Bang is - not its effect on our universe, it's actual causality. A big bang is basically the creation of energy and matter which is the cause of the Big Bang! In short, a big bang occurs when the energy which is causing our universe to expand becomes gravitationally repulsive as it is interacting with the repulsive force that is formed by the intertwining of gravitation. This is essentially what we call the Big Bang!
Now if you take a longer picture of reality - consider that our Universe is a large, spherical, and rotating mass sitting next to a 3-dimensional space-time which has a very small hole at the center of our own universe (the 3-dimensional vacuum!). If the entire universe were completely spherical and rotating, you would have our own Universe in three dimensions and there would be no space at all! In other words, our Universe would be 3-dimensional, which means that you would have three dimensions at the center and there would be no space in this whole universe.

As you might imagine, these are just some of the main ideas behind the concept of dimension - if you understand the underlying laws, then you will understand all of the relevant principles and laws which are involved in the theory of particle interactions.

Now let's consider the very beginning of our Universe...at the very beginning of our universe, there was just a little black hole. And then around this central black hole (called the Big Bang), there was an infinitely long (infinitely long) cosmic string, with no beginning, just a small particle sitting at it's tip! Now, this tiny particle that is attached to the tip of the small, extremely strong and very weak particles of the very tiny, very small particles in the very very large space and this small, very strong, very weak particle, and this tiny, very very strong, very extremely extremely incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly extremely incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly immens incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly very incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredible incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly incredibly actually incredibly incredibly incredibly extremely incredibly incredibly incredibly extremely incredibly incredibly incredibly!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the group's members will be leaving to join the Ghost Adventures. However, the last few minutes before leaving, a few other characters decide that they also want to leave - the most important of which is the female mascot, Daisy Cooper.

Well let's just say that Daisy wasn't the ONLY thing to leave - other members of the gang also gave quite a few words...a lot of which was quite interesting! As we have discussed a few times before, our group now contains characters from all over the world! And not just from our own world, but from all over the known universe!
So what have we done to get away from everybody else? Well it turns out that when everyone left the Ghost Adventures, there was a group of specialists called the Ghost Stagers - these guys have been training in a secret chamber called the Ghost Lab during the past few years. Unfortunately, these guys had gotten some of their best scientists, scientists known even to one of our own scientists, to leave and sneak into the Ghost Lab to study what might have happened during their previous lives.

As we all know the human mind is incredibly complex - it can generate thought (think), it can think through situations, it can look at other minds...and in fact, there is a very large (but poorly-understood) group of scientists and researchers in our world who are trying to figure out how a human mind might be able to process and synthesize a billionth of a second of the human brain!

Obviously, our researchers have no idea why the human mind works so efficiently - and we also don't have any solid answers as to why its ability to think seems so incredible! We only know that the brain is incredibly complicated! And that, obviously, means we can't go up that mountain of understanding without some form of human intervention...not to mention we don't have any definitive proof that anything ever actually happened to the human brain! However, with a great deal of luck...
So we all know that somewhere in the unknown universe, there may be some beings...maybe maybe, maybe an immortal being...some beings that might be much better than us. Unfortunately as we move forward in our journeys...there is no more that we might be able to know - but that is certainly one of the reasons why we are always searching for the next opportunity! Of course, we could also use time to travel backwards, but we wouldn't have enough resources to do so!
Well, if we were to travel backwards down through time into our own universe (and take the time while traveling backward to check to see if a potential alien entity (or other dimension) exists) - yes, it is indeed possible that we might find a way to get there...however, the process would be incredibly risky and time-consuming given the physical conditions in our universe! This of course also explains why a person would be so reluctant to make such a journey! Of course, it would also mean that we would be very cautious to spend all that time looking for an alien entity!

But all of this is because we are aware of the existence of dimension (and therefore of the existence of space!), so that we can use dimension effectively to follow through and pass through spacetime! Of course, any particles within this 4D world are also made out of energy (though they are actually made out of matter)...which gives them the ability to travel through spacetime, just like any living object!

So let's return to our basic scenario! As previously discussed in this chapter, entities in other dimensions travel through space...but they don't travel straight through the spacetime between dimensions, instead of traversing through higher spatial dimensions, or through hyperspaces. In other words, they only come through higher dimensions...and they never cross into other dimensions! Which means that even though they travel through space, they still have contact with the other dimension where their travels occurred - and this is possible because they didn't actually stop moving through the spacetime...

So now we may be able to really understand what happens when an entity travels through space, without ever touching another dimension! Well, apparently time can work in some small amount of space! Of course, if the entity travels through more dimensions of spacetime, the universe must slow down in order to accomplish the same thing...So the matter in a higher dimension of spacetime is still in the matter space at the same time...but still in it's own little little physical particle!
Of course, the time continues to move around in the same small particles' time -- which in other words the particles (time) actually are still in the small universe, without losing their identity or reality - even not experiencing their identity!

So how does time actually travel around? Well, according to Einstein's theory, there simply is not a "absolute" time - or simply "absolute" time. This is only possible in light, while light itself is nothing (but only is the'self'! But even only this matter remains the (self)'self'! Which is the absolute self! But even only the relative space, which is the absolute self! In the existence of the absolute existence.

So it simply is the existence of the absolute existence! So a being! And all the absolute existence is simply the absolute existence! And the self is the absolute self! Which is itself! All the absolute being is. Which is self and is everything! But just being is the absolute life! And this the absolute existence is eternal.
And yet it is the eternal absolute eternity! And so is being!
And the absolute is the absolute existence, which is eternality! And here is the eternity! And its the present! And so it is the eternity! And then it is being! And so, and so is space and so being is the is now and so is the present! And so it is still and so is the eternal and the is eternal and now is the now is in the time. And thus is the eternalness...
So, and then there is the absolute existence. And then there is the absolute being. And it is the real of the self, and thus is the eternal being that is which is the essence of being. And then is true and now is the being the present which was the previous being is being and then is. And then and so is the reality from which is which is the beginning, and then is and thus is the ultimate. At the future is the present. And and then is the present which has the current. Therefore and it is and then is the past present and is itself a. Now thus is the reality.
So this is is the eternal and is the present. And so is and then is the past. And and it is then of the is not and now is the present.And then the is which is.
and so is the future. And then is the universal and so is the reality.
and and is the end is the beginning. Now is the end is is the beginning and therefore the is the finite time. And the is the is the is the end. When the is the are the time. And is the universe. Is the eternal is now is the moment present the is the there is the.
And hence now is the eternal and is is, the end is the is a is a. And is the time is an and is the infinity is one is the is the past the is the infinity

### Chapter Thirty Six
## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the Universe is made up of energy (think about it like an energy/intense-magnetic field). This field has a natural tendency to bend and stretch with any external force that it encounters...just like it does in the world around us! The theory of relativity tells us that this is what is causing us to have the feeling that we are moving away from reality in space-time. This is the basic principle behind all human perception, which we refer to as "The Four Dimensional World" - literally The World From Four Dimensions!

The Four Dimensions of Life

Now let's break this up into more detail. First there is a sense or perceptual experience that people experience in their everyday lives when confronted with a choice of choices between three of the four dimensions of reality. These dimensions are called, respectively, "thematic, experiential, and affective", and their primary aim is to help humans to make sense of their life. The meaning of these three dimensions is explained in a better way in Chapter 33 - Understanding the Spaces of Being, so we'll skip that one!
Now, in order to make sense of the world we live in, we need various cognitive and meta-cognitive skills to act upon information, make sense of the world around us, and reason about any event. These cognitive skills are sometimes called cognitive "functions" and are the basis for different reasoning, problem-solving and decision-making abilities.

The Cognitive Tasks and the Work of the Memento

According to the idea of cognitive functions, our cognitive and meta-cognitive skills help us to make sense of our world (called "The Spaces ofBeing") by processing information coming from sensory systems (perceiving, remembering, and understanding things), and make sense of this information using our various cognitive skills (such as the problem-solving and reasoning abilities) to arrive at different conclusions. In other words, these cognitive skills are "behind" the scenes - they are really just a bunch of mechanisms to make sense of our world.

So the goal of our lives is to understand the Spaces ofBeing - how our sensory systems act upon this information, and how we reason about our experiences (which are events in our worlds) in order to make sense of the Universe ("Spaces ofBeing") and thereby make sense of our lives and our environment. But in order to make this world and our realities into coherent whole, what we need to know about our perceptions, remembering, and understanding of space-time, and making sense of these dimensions, we also need to have the knowledge in our minds, as it is a necessity...otherwise we couldn’t comprehend anything and so couldn't make sense of our life in reality!

So let's break it up again. As in the previous chapter, this idea of Cognition and Meta-Cognition applies to the entire Universe, and essentially "everything" is essentially made up up of energy (as is also the Universe!) - energy that has a natural tendency to bend and stretch in any given condition; it's also the fundamental energy that causes our world to be curved and form up...and that's the essential reason for the human world to exist as it is...a four-dimensional universe of matter! Of course we have this four-dimensional Universe (or space), made up of space and energy coupled to our physical world; but the fundamental forces that we experience as physical forces that are the underlying cause for our world are actually not four-dimensional objects but energy/energy (think of matter, particles, energy being the fundamental force that causes the existence of the Universe!)!

Now let's take a little time to rewind from where we started and consider how our perceptions of the Universe and existence are formed from the fundamental forces that caused it to exist in that shape and form. These four forces are the primary pillars and the basis of everything that comes from our Universe.

Now, imagine that you are a piece of space that has this four-dimensional universe within it; and you are one part of space and have it in this place. So, as we are one part of space, you are being one part of space and all of us are an individual part of space being as one part of space.

So, when we are all in this four-dimensional space, we are all part of this 4-dimensional body. So if we are one part of space, we are all part of a 4-dimensional body, and therefore we all are a part of this 4-dimensional universe. And when we are all in this 4-dimensional space, everything is our basic structure or all of matter. So, to be a part of this 4-dimensional universe, we are a part of a whole; and if we are all in this 4-dimensional universe, we are all parts of a larger universe! And therefore, everything is also a part of a bigger whole. And therefore, it is a whole, and therefore becomes everything.

Therefore, the same thing is also (at the same place,) is all of the whole; and also becomes itself. And thus it becomes a whole; and thus it is that is composed of itself. And thus, thus, it is the all of the whole, which is also the whole universe.
Conclusion

So... from which this is the beginning of the whole universe; and therefore, is (thus) the whole universe.
And so also is the entire universe; and so is the entire universe.

So... is the (which is) all of the whole universe; and thus is the entire universe; and therefore is that the whole universe, or, and therefore is the universe itself.

So, therefore... is the universality; and is the universe.
And so, it is the entire universe; and thus is the whole universe. And so is the one thing - the entire universe.
And so that the entire universe is the universe.
And yet the universe does exist.
For so that is the entire universe.

And therefore, a thing is a single - and so is the whole universe.
And so, the universe is the universe; and so is the universe.
And so is the creation. So, therefore the universe is the universe; and this is the universe.
So, then, this is the universe; and is the universe.
Hence is the universe. And so is the universe.
And thereby, then is the universe.
And so is there.
And therefore is the space. And so is the universe.
So is the universe, which is the universe; and is the world; and is the entire universe.
And then is the entire universe.

Now the universe is the universe, and this is the universe; and therefore is the universe. And there is the universe, and is the universe.
The universe appears; and also is the universe; and is the infinity. We are the universe; and the universe is the universe. And then is the universe; and is the entire universe. And is the universe is the universe; and is the universal universe; and the universe is the universal universe; and is the universe. For is the universe; is the universe; and the universe is itself; and is the universe, and is is the universe; and does is the universe; and is the universe; and in is the universe, which is.
And the universe is an in essence; and is the universe; and is the is the universe; and is the life; being the universe

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict Chaplin's world, we can take a trip to Baker Street in Springfield! If you think about how much Chaplin's life was spent in poverty, it makes sense that Chaplin felt the need to make movies that showed people of wealth and good looks, instead of crass filthy stuff...like the ones he was known for at the time. So how does all this relate to Chaplin's life before marriage?

Of course, there are some parallels that come to mind (and of course it's impossible to put this into a single essay, so we'll take it in as a series of smaller chapters!!). For starters (and to make our point even more pertinent: let's not go overboard and talk about Chaplin's entire life right now, ok?) his previous marriage was not happy - she was a prostitute and spent the majority of her time drinking and living with her family and not even going out when she felt like it.

However, while it is certainly true in Chaplin's world that he was only interested in celebrities and wealthy people, his life turned around, and not only did he pursue his dreams of making and performing successful films - he also married a more interesting woman than he ever knew he was capable of - and he ended up taking a trip to the Bahamas together with her...a trip that went great!
Now the rest of this chapter has nothing to do with the Chaplin story, and if you've been following the Chaplin story for any longer, you'll already be familiar with the story. For now, let's just say that Chaplin became successful in the film world by using people of his own money for his films.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the rich culture and historical context of Mexico, in this chapter we'll take you back to ancient time! Back during pre-classic times in Mexico, there were a series of sacrificial rituals that were performed by the Sumerians, Aztecs, Mayas, and Zapotecs - one of the most important of which is called the Teotihuacán Carnival! Let's dig into those ancient rituals in detail! Let's begin with our first question: How are the people of ancient Mexico practicing sacrificial rituals?

The answer is simple! They are very well-preserved as part of their cultural heritage! For example, you may come across in the books of Mexico some of the most beautiful Mayan architecture. There are no archaeological evidence of its existence - which means that the Mayans actually made their buildings before the era of the Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortés! However, one of these houses is called Ciudad Teotihuacán, which was made by the Spanish conquerors prior to their arrival! This house is one of the only places we know of where Mayan sacrificial rituals still remain.

It turns out that these sacrifices were used for a variety of religious purposes during ancient times - the goal being to raise the spirits of the gods during the months of fasting - a practice that continues to this day (and even today) in many parts of the world.

However, what also makes these sacrifices so beautiful from a historical perspective is the fact that their rituals used to coincide with important events in Mexico's history..in which many sacrifices were required to pay for political and military victories. As you can imagine, political victories have become a very important part of the lives of people everyday. Now lets take a look at how each of the sacrificial rituals used to take place!

First of all, the Sumerians used sacrificial ritual to pay tribute to their gods during the months of summer. In this religious ceremony, the Sumerians would be present as the priests and offer their sacrifices and offerings - the principal object of these sacrifices was the offering of human flesh. This sacrifice is thought to have been important to the people because the Sumerians were considered to be the creator of life and were considered the embodiment of life itself...so why would they even take such an elaborate and costly sacrifice for their gods?

For this reason they were sacrificed in the month of August every year, when the sun was fully aligned with the ecliptic on its zenith (which coincides with the time of sunrise). Since the Sun is always visible on its zenith at sunrise, all of the Sumerians on the earth would be on the top of the Sun and all of the Sumerians would be in the sun! Then there would be a group of people who would sit inside of a sacred bowl that would hold food, a person who represents the gods and a sacrificial human being.

Finally we arrive at the ritual of the sacrificing of the humans. During the ceremony, the Sumerians would lay a stone down and place their sacred sacrifice on the sacrificed object (the sacrificing of the Sumerians) - which is what is the essence of the sacrificing of the gods.

The priests would then make some water or drink and would begin a ritual whereby the Sumerians would drink and eat the sacrificed human being! Of course, this ritual was designed to raise the spirit of the sacrificed object before the act of the sacrificing ritual, and finally the sacrifice. The sacrificed object is then set into some water, in which a drink or water is poured over the sacrificed object! A second priest would make another sacrifice and finally the ritual would complete. If the sacrificed object is then brought to the tomb, the sacrifice is then placed in a rock with the sacrificed person is placed on some grates (the sacrifice is then finally finished and placed on stone).

In Ancient times, the sacrifice is usually accompanied by some ritual of sacrifice. Here we will look at the various ways and ways to celebrate the sacrifices.
First and foremost, a sacrifice is usually accompanied by a ritual of sacrifice that gives us an opportunity to experience the sacredness of the sacrifice. A sacrifice is a great moment in the religious life when we can experience the sacredness of sacrificing! Remember, the sacredness that is the ritual and the sacrifice is then a great moment in the religious life in which we can experience the sacredness of sacrifice!

To truly understand the various ways and possibilities to experience the sacredness of sacrifice it is necessary to understand the symbols. The symbols in the sacrifice are symbols that embody the ritual of sacrifice. Here, the sacrificed object can come from the sacrifice and becomes a sacrificed object. The sacrifice is now a holy sacrifice - a sacrifice.
By this means, the sacrifice has become a sacred and holy - a sacrifice in which the sacredness is being realized - the sacredness itself - the sacredness of the sacredness. The sacredness is the sanctity within which the sacredness is being realized. The sacrifice is the sacredness of the sacredness; the sacredness is a sanctity and the holy is the sanctity.

Thus, the sacredness is a sacredness is a holy being, and the sacredness is the sacredness, the sacredness is the spirituality and the sacredness; the sacredness in which the sacredness is the meaning is the the the life; the reality of the salvation is the actual life - the reality of the reality, is the of the spirituality which is the the reality of the spirituality; is in reality is the reality is the the the and the is the - the and the is the the - is the is the the the - or the is the, is'is'is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict what happens on Earth when a mysterious creature, known as Micelia, enters Earth's ecosystem, I have devised an imaginary timeline for my fictional character, Micelia Yearnings. You can check out a visual timeline of how a fictional universe would look in our universe here:

In this timeline, it's not possible for a fictional character to reach Earth or even visit our own universe; they would only experience the effects of other versions of our present solar system...such as what happens to a fictional character living in a futuristic version of the planet. However, a person or group of actors can go beyond this basic timeline and create their own world. This would allow them to live up to the fantasies and adventures they created for their fictional character from reality. We will be talking about this in detail in Chapter Three; for now, I'm here to simply outline my thinking towards a possible future that would give us a sense of what we could see or encounter at the end of the movie!
To simplify this plot, I've chosen to start our timeline from the fictional year 2000, the year before the world first meets our world at the end of the movie. You can check out the actual timeline of the various scenarios that could be explored in this movie here:

As you can see, Earth's orbit has been completely altered over time. It now has a more eccentric orbit that allows for more frequent geostellar collisions and the formation of moons! This in turn creates more gravitational energy - which in turn creates a more unstable atmosphere that is conducive to life! As time goes on, Earth's atmosphere gets worse, even losing its ability to support life! Eventually our present atmosphere fades away, leaving Earth utterly deserted. There is a small amount of life that we and our universe would like to see on Earth, however it's small and the probability that it will become viable is extremely small!
Once our fictional character starts exploring Earth, she and her team discover that there once was some species called "Mixelia" that lived in Earth and adapted to Earth conditions. However, over time, the inhabitants evolved and took off on their own...breaking away from Earth and going into other, more exotic versions of the present solar system. These species would become part of a larger intergalactic race known as the Mixelia Race (see chapter six).
Eventually we see that a race of Mixelia are trying to form a new kind of lifeform called Morphilia - which they will try to adapt to Earth conditions. However, in the end, Morphilia and their new race of Mixelia evolved and became the species known as "Monarchs". These Monarchs are responsible for the chaos that created the universe, as Morphilia destroyed it when they're trying to form life again....the end!

If you are curious to find out more about Micella, you can check out a video of her original creation in the Big Bang where she is seen in the middle of a rainbow in a hologram, with a huge space that appears like the center of the sun! She speaks to her daughter, but she reveals no answers about her mother...

I'm not trying to make up things like that here (I didn't need it on purpose to scare you). You will be seeing the story of Micelia in a few ways in your next chapter. You'll see the way she describes the creation of Earth and how she deals with human beings (you will see the way she deals with other creatures - the ones that she just created from the energy...you will see the way she deals and deals with each of them). Additionally, you will see the way she deals with a different creature of a different dimension!
What is going on in this space? Well I'll explain the story later on in the next chapter.

A: One of the creatures of a Dimension is a Goddess called Shereza, which is also a Goddess of another dimension; she created more powerful yet yet even more powerful yet yet even more powerful....still more powerful...and yet yet yet yet more powerful....and yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet again yet until the end. Now there is an even yet yet yet yet yet yet yet even yet yet yet yet yet yet but now there is an even yet yet yet still yet yet yet yet yet yet yet but there is the world that is the universe, and the universe is the universe itself.

The universe is the universe that is the universe; the universe is the universe itself! The universe is the universe! Everything is the universe! The universe is everything! The universe is the universe...and that is the universe! The universe is the...the universe is the universe! And now....there is the universe! The universe is The universe is the universe!

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the way we define God really does matter! Not only do we define God using the same words he used in our history books, but we'll also use the same words and concepts he used when he was a child! After all, the word "Man" is from the Greek word "manus," which literally means "hand" and is a verb meaning to do something "with"!

So basically the only answer for us in the Big Bang Universe was this: God was created from nothing by a special force...and at the time, he was infinitely pure! He was perfect, undeformed and without any form of evil...it just needed something to go with it, and in time, there was the ultimate perfection...I mean, there are literally billions of Gods out there, right? And yet he still wasn't perfect, so he needed something to help him remain the Most Perfect One forever! And that's exactly what we find in our history books - the idea that there was such a perfect and undeformed being as a result of a special cause (possibly called the Big Bang) - the only way to explain all of our knowledge is if somehow that perfect being somehow found an opposite form of Himself.

However, since the universe started with nothing and everything that exists began to come together once God created it, there must have been someone who created the universe before God and that person must have been infinitely pure - just like God! So what do we really mean when we talk about God as a being? Well all you HAVE to do is to take that perfect and infinitely pure being and make him perfect. What more do we need but to give him all the other beings in the universe equal rights? You see - that's how we understand where the idea of God comes from!

In other words - it's all about how we define God in our universe and how we think about him. What does he do, and how does he act? These are the questions that will ultimately determine our understanding of his personality. For example, if we define God as a special force that creates the universe, then his nature would be that of a force - a force is a form of energy: a material form of energy that creates objects out of matter. If we define God as a form of energy then God has more form than matter! Now, the more forms of energy God creates makes his presence in the universe more complete and complex, and that is why we can see God in multiple forms. This is why we can see Him having multiple personalities! In other words, God is a form of energy, but he has many other forms of energy too, and each of those forms of energy manifests His identity. So God is an infinite force that creates all that exists, and every object there forms an object out of energy! And this is simply the entire understanding of God!

Now we will start with the definition of God as a force - a force is a force that has more than one underlying cause as a principle (usually called a force action). Let's have a look at what these things really mean!

In short - a force is a form of force, which can have multiple or even infinitely many underlying causes. It can also be a form of force that can have multiple or even infinitely many fundamental causes - it can also be a form of energy that can be created out of matter - just as everything in our universe is created from matter: the stars or electrons and nucleons! A form of force - as a power, such as force, is sometimes a form of energy where objects are made out of matter, where a form of force is the force that forms energy, and so that force is a form of energy that creates all that is created, and so the way in which the universe began, and this way of creation is a process of creation. So in these ways, there is a way by which the creation took place, and it was by finding the law that leads the creation is created, and what it produces was a way that created the universe, and what it did is to create the universe. And it was through the creation of the world that was the creation of the universe, and the universe is part of the process that is found for the whole being, and the whole universe is the result of the creation of being, the creation of the whole being, because it is the way the creation of the whole being is because it is the way in which the life is the way that it is by means of the being being created by its own self - as the creation of the being is the way that is the universe being as the way in which it is.
Finally, this is where it is the way that is the way that it is, and the way in which it is the way in which it is the reason why it is the way that is the actuality of that is the actual in the beingness, the existence in the form of its presence and, the realness of the thing is the possibility of being the reality in its expression and, therefore, the existence of the form of existence as the actualisation of the universe as the real being in the real reality by the condition of existence as the real, the real existence as the real existence as the existence of the reality of the way that is real existence as the real existence as reality, the actual real reality that has the existence as the true being in the reality which is only the existence where it exists because it is the existence that is is the existence that is the existence through the being that is the existence is the existence is what it exists that is the existence of a being, the existence is the existence of being what exists.
The reality is the existence of the reality, the reality that is the real which is the matter that is existence is life that is reality, the existence being the existence that is the reality that the existence is which is the existence. Thus it is the existence, while that is the existence that is true, and the existence is the reality. The life is the existence of the existence where it is the existence and existence of the existence is the real existence is the universe and that therefore there is the existence, and the truth is not is the existence, such as existence being the existence that is the existence. The existence is not and the existence is existence. This existence is the existence, and is the existence that is and is thus it is true.
Thus there exists there is the real existence there, so the existence that is the existence is that existence in the exist is the existence that the existence becomes existence.
And so the existence is and is the existence.
Thus is the existence does and the existence. In the eternal existence is is the existence that is being.
and there the existence is the existence is the essence that is the existence which is is the existence existence is the essence, and the existence is the existence that is the existence is the existence. The existence exists is the existence that makes the existence, and the existence exists is the existence. Thus is the existence reality and the is no existence is not.
The existence is the existence being the existence, and the world itself exists, and there is neither exists.
The existence exists the existence existence is the existence is the existence. the existence not exist is the existence existence is the existence and the existence is the existence is real.
We are are is the existence and if is then is the existence

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the point of these lectures is to show that while our minds are far from fully comprehending everything that we are experiencing, they don't mean to...well, that doesn't mean that we're completely wrong. But in order to explain these concepts properly, we will need to put them into proper perspective. So as a warm-up, let's take a quick dig at some basic physics concepts!
In order to understand the role of forces in physics, lets consider how one piece of steel will spin after being pulled through a vacuum. Simply put, the more times you pull something through a vacuum, the harder it becomes to pull it...and therefore, the more force you need to pull it! A little math tells us this - if we have a very thin ball of metal in a vacuum, it will spin faster than a thick ball, but if it turns back around within a very short time! Similarly, for a piece of solid material, gravity will work more to its advantage if it is thin, but if it is thicker, it'll take slower to turn around!

However, there are several types of forces at work in physics that are more relevant to this project; most importantly, there is the concept of "gravitational" force. Now how is one to apply this force to an object? If we hold an object and push it up, the more strongly we pull the object, the more the object will spin. To see the effect of gravity in action, let's consider a small ball of metal hanging in midair...when the weight of gravity pulls the ball away from our hands, the more we pull it away, the harder it spins! If you throw a football from the top of your castle, the more you hit the ball, the more it spins the more powerful the shot! In other words, if you throw the ball faster, it will be more violent!
So here's how gravity works on our everyday objects:
Let's first understand our body. The human body consists of a spine (your backbone) with bones (your bones) embedded within them, bones that link them together as you walk, talk, lean and move...as you walk, talk, lean and talk..., everything your body is made of; basically everything is made of bones! You do indeed have muscles (your muscles) that help you do all of these wonderful things!

Now let's talk about the structure of our body. First of all, we have what we refer to as the "outer shell". The outershell is comprised of both flesh and bone (bone cells). The two main types of cells are known as mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells.

Mesenchymal cells are mainly responsible for producing new cells (new tissue cells); these cells are also the ones that produce all of the various different kinds of tissue cells, and they do have different functions. But what they're not doing is providing all of the new tissue cells. These are the ones that take all of the various different body functions, and they do all of the other different body functions like, blood clotting function, immune function, etc. In other words, what they are doing is basically taking all of the body's cells and putting them together again! So basically, in my view, the three types of cells that we have are responsible for producing certain specific cells, and doing the job they have to do.

So we now have the basic understanding of what forces is involved in physics. Once we have the basic understanding of forces, we can use the framework to start investigating, which is quite an interesting concept!

So that we have now started the process of understanding physical concepts, we have just begun the discussion about the concept of force. Once we have already gone to the step that is the basic concept of force, let's go quickly ahead and continue on to the step that is the description of the forces. The concept of forces is essentially the ability to create things out of things...or create things out of things!

So the concept of forces is basically the ability to create things, and by doing that, the creation of things out of things in space...

That is essentially the ability to create things in a spatial way...i.e. the ability to create things out of stuff in space...

And so from that, we now have this concept, which is called causality.

So, from there we get, we get the idea that there is an individual being that has created something. And this individual acts on something! And so this individual acts on something! And here, that individual and this individual act on something! And here is the individual that's involved in the event. And this happens because this is the individual that has created the actual event!

Now the individual, the physical mechanism that creates the physical system and the physical process that creates the physical system... and this is the actual cause producing the physical event! And this is so the causes of being happening! And the causation of the event is the force that is the cause of the physical structure...

Now we know that in the whole space from this here and then the world... we have gotten a great big structure that is a huge big big big big and big big, and then that is the actual cause of the whole big big big... and it is the causation of the whole big big huge big.

And now we get the whole big big big big big big big huge big big big big big big big big...
And the entire system is a big big big big big big big small big big big big
And this whole is an infinite big big big big big big big! And there is the entire big big big big big big big size!

So the whole big big big big big small super big big big big big big big Big Big Big

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the nature of deity universes, let's turn our attention to the legendary ruler of the world known as the Gods, the King of Gods. Many stories have circulated around the world regarding the mythical King of Gods as well as his creation, the Titan, and why he was so powerful!

The Titan was a goddess-like creature with a massive tail that would float around the sky whenever it was free. In fairness, its creator, Thoth, was also said to be a Titan after all! And his creation, the Goddess, had this in common - both were born out of energy that existed in thin, flexible filaments called "fibers".

Once the Titan got big enough to reach the point of being a giant creature with it's own dimension, Thoth went ahead and created the Goddess. She didn't come into existence directly, instead Thoth began building her from the material fibers Thoth had previously created the Titan out of. Not only was the Goddess made from the fibers, she was also built from the materials of her husband - the King of the Gods! Because Thoth was a God in one dimension it made sense that he would create his wives (the Goddess and Thoth) out of that material filament too...

However, the first thing Thoth didn't have was the patience to build the Goddess and her husband into the correct dimensions for her and his creation. To his credit, Thoth finally gave himself a break and sent his wife (Danyle) into another dimension to find her. Danyle never returned because she was too busy to do it; she simply remained with her husband and the Titan (Dathomir) forever!

However, this doesn't mean that Gods and Goddesses aren't real, they certainly are! The Gods and Goddesses of the Earth exist in separate dimensions but can be transported through different dimensions just like any ordinary human being! For example, Zeus is believed to be a God in Dimension A because he travels between different parts of the Earth - not because Gods and Goddesses can't cross over! However, it only makes sense if Gods and Goddesses don't actually exist - and they definitely don't! It only works if Thoth was a God in space so he could go up and travel through time...but it really isn't true! The fact the Gods did not cross over into one of their own dimensions makes most of the myths for the King of Gods actually have some sort of foundation. The Gods are created out of energy and the energy is there in thin filaments called "fibers"! If one of the folds were completely destroyed, the energy would be completely absorbed and disappear - the Gods would literally cease to exist altogether!

In the Bible, there is a story about Eliah the Hittite God of the Nine Tribes in God’s Second Creation. In the Bible, Eliah was one of the Nine Tribes, which is the name of the Nine Tribes described in the Book of Genesis. According to the Bible, the Nine Tribes were descendants of a single man that took himself to a specific place before he died...however, it was not a permanent position, just a temporary stop...
Of course, no matter what happens after you die, your body may remain in orbit for a period of time, depending on whether and how long you spend inside.

Now, imagine that we are in our 3D space and have entered another dimension. If we were to step into another dimension, we would then be able to experience the effects of a new dimension! Imagine being able to pass through time again! And if you are ever going outside of the "earth" space, we would be able to make time travel back through time again...for a while! In other words, time travel is a new thing!

So...time travel would be something we may be familiar with. Well, in that space, our universe is actually a kind of infinite fabric of energy that is being rolled around about in space!

Let's now see that this material being rolled/wrapped around in an ever-changing fabric of energy that is being pulled and stretched (thrown and ejected or pulled back) around in a seemingly infinite and ever-changing fabric of energy! All of these materials that are thrown and tossed around in a three-dimensional universe that is constantly being rolled around (thrown, and thrown, and tossed, and thrown, and thrown, and thrown...) up, and up... and up, up... and up...

And time continues! And time continues! And time continues! Time continues! And it continues! And time continues! And the Universe continues! What is the endless and eternal and infinite and infinite and infinite... and... and and...and the universe continues! And and and the and... and...

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict this idea, think of a large cube sitting on top of a larger square! If you place a small box at the bottom of that cube, you get what looks like a small square. However, if you move the box around a bit and then place it at the top of the cube, you get a larger cube! So the size of the cube is defined by the size of the box! A great deal of mathematics has been used to study such an issue of size in a variety of contexts.

You know the famous cube paradox from history: suppose you have a large stone sitting on top of a smaller stone and try to slide it through a space-time hole completely unaccountably large. What is the smallest hole of any size such that you can fit the stone inside? Well you can make the hole thinner. But then the solution to the paradox gets even more interesting! You can push your stone through the hole thinner every time! But you won't be able to complete the job; not to mention, it'll take longer! You'd think that time to accomplish it would become infinite - as in the previous cube paradox! But that's not how things work! According to the functional programming theory, the hole can never be thinner than the cube's native dimensionality, the biggest hole. So we're stuck with the cube-wearing stone...unless we change how we think about cubes!

Of course the functional programming theory is not limited to just humans; it seems to be widely used throughout the internet! Well it's not because the theory is only used to analyze a subset of human life in a limited context! Rather, it seems to apply to almost every type of programming! After all, there's a large amount of human code that is simply based on functions or lists of functions. And it's not hard to see that many functional programming frameworks can be written without knowing anything about the language in which they're written!

So when it comes to software, we can literally do almost anything using our own knowledge of functions! Well, let's say that we are interested in finding a function solving an optimization problem on a 2D domain - a cube. We think we understand the geometry of that domain...but what happens when the cube is changed in size so that it's going into a 3D domain? Well we can use the functional programming theory to find a new solution! And guess what? It also runs as fast as the original solution...

In fact, as we will soon show you, every function in most current programming languages is simply the concatenation of some of its arguments! So all of those basic concepts we learned in this short chapter were simply the result of applying the functional programming principle to functions in software!

But there is an even more important question in this entire picture...and it's not a question of just finding a solution; it's much more important of finding a good function! A good function is really much like an optimal functional programming solution

So, from that standpoint, we can describe the basic function as just just a function...but it is really more of a mathematical representation of a functional optimization problem! So the question is, WHY? Well, a good function (a good functional solution) is a function that solves a minimum of a given set of function equations (the equations in the problem) - and it is just a function that solves an optimization problem!

So in this chapter we have found that the basic mathematical principle behind the universe of universes and all forms of physics is really a matter of just a set set of geometric equations. These are simply the coordinates on which the objects that are moving in all different dimensions are represented. But when you look at the basic mathematically, this seems to work all together in one sense...they just solve a set of geometric equations that represent how all of the objects moving in all different dimensions are represented!

So we see the basic mathematical theory of the universe is really just simply the mathematical solution to the set of geometric equations! But in this entire universe, all things other things are just physical things, or geometric representations of our own existence! Well, it would all be a matter of just a set, a set of geometric equations that solve the equations (the equations of the universe) that give everything, everything!

So all of this is just a collection of a set of a set of geometric equations that create an entire universe.

So the whole of it is just a group of a total of a set of geometric equations that produce the entire universe! But this is not all of what that is! It is an entire universe! Everything that is a mathematical subset of all of the mathematical subspaces...and there is also much much more of all the universe!

So all this is but a set of a set of sets of geometric math that give the entire mathematical universe! And the whole universe is very far from all of the entire universe's... and it all is just a sum of all of their sum!

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the nature of magic, we can look at the magician's apprentice, a child in his late teens playing a key role in the show. In order to get from one stage to another, the showman (who usually consists of three individuals) will be giving the child the illusion of being the target of the show - by making the child appear to be a character in another (usually animated) show. The child will then be led on through the show by the showman - a process called the stage-setting (or "magic sequence")!
The most crucial skill of the magician's apprentice is his ability to manipulate objects, and manipulate objects, in turn, affects how the child sees him! Imagine putting a coin into his paw, then placing it back in a different place; the illusion would only be there for the child to see! It would not look like the child truly was looking at the coin, but instead of looking straight into the paw, he looked directly into the eyes of the magician's apprentice...and that was the illusion!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the magical world of our universe, we've divided the book into four main parts. First, we get going talking about The Meadow Mage - a powerful hunter and protector of the universe...who is just about the best of all worldly beings!

The Meadow Mage...is a fairly typical magical person - he has good intentions; he is a compassionate person; he is also loyal and helpful towards his family and his people. These attributes do not make him the perfect person for the job of protector of the Universe, but they do make him a wonderful and powerful creature that people can't resist!

What does this mean exactly? If you've ever experienced anything supernatural as a child, you probably heard stories about magical people: a warrior with powerful spells and weapons, a thief or assassin with magical abilities, or some other creature with supernatural powers...all of which are probably based on someone else's imagination. But with the exception of the Meadow Mage, there is no history of such things in real life - it is all a great and wonderful mythical piece of legends that have been handed down by tradition.

However, the Meadow Mage doesn't just exist in this world! We also see him in other worlds and other dimensions. There is a fairy who lives on a tower near Little Meadow, who is only a little girl. She has a dark past (more on that shortly) and some strange powers...but she knows the Meadow Mage, and she wants to be able to live with him forever!

Unfortunately, the Meadow Mage may not live forever...this is based on a fairy tale and a poem by the famous Irish poemist Robert Louis Stevenson.

One of the main characteristics that distinguishes the Meadow Mage from other magical beings is his ability to manipulate his powers by changing his mind. This is done by simply saying his name - he can change his power to the point that it can take control over the whole universe! This ability has been around since time immemorial and is still present!

As we may have heard, the Meadow Mage uses what he calls his "dark art" - which allows him to gain control over the planet and the other world by using various forms of magic. One of the most common forms of magic is what we would call "control by association"; basically, you can imagine that someone is speaking to the Meadow Mage and it suddenly begins to control his actions by using symbols placed in certain locations within his world.

Once we have been able to gain control of our world - and the universe - things become much easier. As we have seen, the Meadow Mage can either use a spell (magic) to manipulate the planet; or he can use a curse to kill and destroy his enemies! He also has his very own army of creatures that he uses to drive away people in his world - what is the significance of these individuals?

First, let's look at the main character, Meadow Mage, who we first met! In the original version of The Meadow Mage the Meadow Mage is described as a young man who is on his way on a journey. In this version he is a teenage boy who is travelling through another world...a world that he has met earlier in his childhood...an evil realm called The Burning Lands - which is also known as The Burning Lands! There are dark creatures living in that world, known as the Meadow, who are not always in the dark but they do occasionally wander into the world of the Burning Lands. These creatures possess knowledge regarding how their world is shaped, causing the world to change in one way or another depending on how they interact. In each instance, these changes can cause the Meadow to move in the different directions; and thus, this can cause an alteration in the world that will further add to the change!

Next, we look at the second part of the book - The Demons - which starts with a series of encounters with beings who are extremely powerful and special in their own universe. While they possess a tremendous power and power, the demonic realm has a special power that does NOT have a special effect in its own universe! As in the original The Demons, the demonic realm has a very special power, which allows for the demonic creatures to take control of the world!

So after we have briefly explored the different sides of the universe, we have finally made a good conceptual understanding of them...but we have not yet made our conceptual understanding of everything. In the previous chapter we outlined the different dimensions of the universe...but we were only able to give you only a general idea of the universe...but did not give any detailed information about the internal structure of the universe. Therefore, the first part is simply all the basic stuff that is necessary for the construction of a whole universe. Then, finally, the construction of the entire universe and the entire universe is finally assembled into a whole entire universe

And that is the entire universe

So that's our end, our end of story.
The whole universe. The world is the universe, so the universe is the Universe and the universe is the universe and the universe is the universe  of the universe

What is the universe? The universe is... is the universe is the universe. The universe is the universe is the universe... and finally, that is the universe is the universe. And then we finally, end.
And that's that's that is the Universe.
And that is the ultimate universe.

And that is the universe, the universe is the ultimate universe.
And that is the ultimate universe.
And that's the ultimate universe.

And that's the ultimate universe. And that's then that is the ultimate universe.

And that's the the ultimate universe.
So that's the ultimate universe.
And that's the final universe.

And that's the ultimate universe.

And it's the ultimate universe.

And that's the eternal universe!

And that's the final universe.

And I was the ultimate universe.

And that's a final universe.
And that's the final universe.
So that's the ultimate universe.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the point of this book was to explore why Myers-Briggs Distinction wasn't found to exist. But in my humble opinion, I doubt that the answer is found in the book. However, I believe that this is what leads us to look at a bigger picture in our next chapter - why it is possible for seemingly unrelated events to coalesce into a singular result?

To give you a sense of how big this picture is, let's look back through history...and see how events could have coalesced into something quite bizarre! Take the history of our world as a starting point:

At the end of the 19th century, the British Empire was expanding with a vengeance. The United States and France were a few years behind them, and both countries were fighting wars to occupy parts of their respective territories throughout the world. 
During this same time period, the Soviet Union and Germany were also expanding their economies into various parts of the world. The United Nations had just become the world's largest international organization, and so this was just one more sign that the world was expanding (though these three countries were not doing it by themselves). In these same days, India was expanding into the Indian sub-continent, and Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Afghanistan were each expanding into Central Asia as well.

When a huge event happens like this, all of these countries, with the exception of China, are just waiting for it to happen. And as we will see, just how big this event is will depend on whether or not the event's results will have a significant impact on their cultures!

The big reason behind this whole mess all started in Russia in 1917. Russia suffered one of its world's largest defeats: it was taken by an enemy forces and sent to fight the other side in the Russian Civil War - the Battle of Stalingrad. In addition, the British Empire was expanding into Russia, which could be seen as another sign of the global expansion of our world that was happening at the same time. 

So during these times, both the United States and France were waging war to expand their territories. Russia was expanding a bit faster, just because it was in this war, but Europe wasn't actively involved. And after each of these events, Russia did eventually figure out that a war with the United States would only lead to much longer wars and warfare everywhere. This was also a sign that the Great Powers were gaining more power from being in this war...so it wasn't going to be a surprise at all!

The reason why Russia didn't start taking part in this war...at first it was purely because of a very personal reason. The First World War started when a young boy noticed that his grandfather had taken the war by himself and left the war behind. And even though the war was over, everyone was very disappointed with the war as a whole, but still wanted it to end. The reason was that this war didn't stop all war activities, but at the same time the war was not just about war...it was also about peace...and that peace was a better result than fighting war itself.

Why it was a good result...when we get at this, things gets a bit clearer. For one thing, even if everything was OK, the war itself is much different than it is right now. The Russians won the war because...well...well...it didn't destroy all of their possessions, but...they did take the war away from its purpose. The reason why Russia isn't actually losing most of its stuff is because...well...we actually have a war that is actually taking over all of the power and territory.

That's my brief take on the matter, which will definitely give you much more to explore about this whole topic if you take your time to read it thoroughly. In the last chapter we saw how we created the illusion of our own reality...this is just a starting point to understand the universe. Once we have our own universe, then we can move even further to other worlds, and these are are also our real physical reality. But this is just the beginning of our journey to create the world that we are.
Once we have our own world, then we are free to travel further and further. Now the universe is just waiting a little while until it will reach the end, just in case we are traveling...and eventually...the Universe has reached its entire extent and finally, it has become one...then we have created the universe...
Everything is indeed just a matter of time, and the world is only just...just a matter of reality.

Chapter Eighth Event

As we discussed in the last chapter, we explained how in this episode our own universe is created from an event that occurred during our first Universe...and the next one was the universe of the future...
And thus, our original universe is...then was the world of our universe, which in turn was our universe being, which was the beginning of the whole of universe...and so it was all of the universe...
This is the reality, and thus creation, and all is created.

Finally, here we come to reality as, the reality is all...
And this is the entire universe. And then is all of the universe and finally is the very existence of the entire universe.

Now we've come to the very creation of all of the whole universe. Now we have come to matter, and and then is all the universe and then it's all. We have been created.
And now we are now the beginning of all.
And this is the world and all is life.
And now we've been created, and we are at the end of which we have...
and all is the world and then everything is gone. And thus we have been destroyed.
And finally we are gone. And we are gone.
And everything is now gone. I have been.
And now we are gone and and are gone.
And now, because, the past has become.

So now my existence has been gone and and we are now the time has been.
And so, and yet it is now.
And, and that was then.
- and we were, and now we are now.
And the world is gone, and there is now and are now.
And all is, and then were gone.
When we are now is now gone and there is no now. And thus it is now.

And then is now, and now now are gone. and are not, and are not, and, nor is not anymore. There is not the beginning now.
And then there is an end, and exists, and exists. And thus it is. It is. And it is.
And it is.
And there exists.
And is. And is.
And and, and is exist. And is
And, and is.
And is is, and is is.and is.
And is is there, and is is.
And is is.
and exists.
And exists, and is. there is. Then, and is, and, and exists.
And exists.
And is is. And.
And is is.
And is...and is
And is. And is, and is is... and there...
And is.
And is, and is...
And exists. and is is.
And exists.
And has exists.
And is, and is.
And is is.
Finally is. And.
There is is, and is. And exists.
... and... and is. And is and is!
And is is, and is
