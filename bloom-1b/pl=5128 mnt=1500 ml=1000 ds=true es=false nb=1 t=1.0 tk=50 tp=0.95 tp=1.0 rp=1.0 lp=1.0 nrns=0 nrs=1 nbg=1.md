 Of course, there are various other reasons why deities do not have to worry about time dilation at all, including the fact that they are immortal, which means that they can actually "ride" their way through time - but in that case, it would be interesting to know how many such deities are in existence!

Lastly, while the above list does not include all aspects of dimension travel, we do want to mention that there are certain kinds of entities which are not allowed to travel freely through spacetime. In other words, we want to know which kinds of entities can travel between different dimensions. As an example, if our 4D particle were made entirely of matter and energy, it would be allowed to travel freely through our 4D universe and enter into another dimension (i.e. Dimension X) - but it would not be able to do so if it were to enter into our 3D universe - simply because Matter, Energy, and Space would not be able to co-exist.

All of this leads us to a fairly simple conclusion - if there are things out there that can travel from one place to another in different dimensions, we can be quite certain that they exist! However, as we mentioned earlier, we are far from being certain about what that might look like, so this is a whole other topic!

A:

As far as I know there is nothing about relativity or gravity in quantum mechanics that prevents you from travelling to other dimensions.  But in general it is very difficult to travel to other dimensions, and you can only get to any of them by using a device like a hyperdrive or travelling at very high speed.
It might be useful to note that the idea of'spatial' and 'time' are only conceptually defined.  They are not necessarily physically existing as distinct entities.  One may use a metaphor to speak of'space' but it doesn't mean anything in the physical world.  Likewise, you could talk about 'having a'space' in your head, but it doesn't mean anything in the physical world.
So in order for something to exist as'space' you need to make it exist, but I don't think that you could make anything physically existing without some form of intervention.
EDIT:  I guess I just meant to point out that you could have many different degrees of freedom in a single physical entity (think particles and vectors) but that's not true for a physical system as a whole.  But it could still be possible for multiple degrees of freedom to coexist.
This is more or less because in quantum mechanics the standard definition of reality is not necessarily a mathematical one.  You can always have more than one definition of reality.
I guess the idea is that you can define space and time differently depending on what you want to study.  A particle is an object which does not have space but has time and so it is not possible for a particle to be defined by two different values for space and time but they can be defined by their momentum.
So I think that for space you want to get a physical existence and a'spacetime' (not really the same thing) you want to create an abstract conceptual space to represent the idea of space and time.
