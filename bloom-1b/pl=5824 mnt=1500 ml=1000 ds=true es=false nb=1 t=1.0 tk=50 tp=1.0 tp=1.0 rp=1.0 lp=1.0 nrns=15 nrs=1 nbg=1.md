## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the universe has a way of working itself out! There is definitely no question that life started on Earth, and that is the only place we live right now!

Of course, the universe is vast beyond our own simple comprehension. And it turns out that it is far from a flat, homogeneous world as we have been taught to believe at some point in our childhood. It is actually quite complex and highly dynamic! This isn't to say that we cannot begin to see a pattern in nature's seemingly chaotic behavior, but rather that these things happen at a much slower pace. Even our bodies, which are made of just protein and glucose, could only be evolved in only about 200 million years!

What does this mean for our current fashion industry? Well the big change for the designer community is a new wave of technology that is currently making it really possible for designers to create high-end fashion items that will look almost like real thing! That's right - you can literally see actual items made by the fashion industry right here on this site!

Now let us consider another concept from modern art - that of "immaterial," or "immaterial objects," that were used by artists for centuries. This term describes objects that have no material parts, yet still interact with each other and their environment.

How does this affect the fashion industry - let's say you are creating a print dress and there's a large, full-scale model on the back. How would that affect the size, shape, and price of the dress? Well let us look at the case of famous fashion designer Balenciaga.  According to a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, the designer may have been involved in a mysterious death after taking a sleeping pill in the 1920s.

Some say there is very little evidence to suggest that Balenciaga had any illness at all during this entire time period, but it has been thought that he may have been suffering from a drug called Euphorbia (also known as the "holas!" pill or "beets!" pill - I must tell you these are some seriously toxic substances, but in no way related to today - there are countless health professionals that recommend taking Bibles at night if you're planning on having a drink - I may have some tips of my own! ;-) ).

If your hypothesis is correct, you will see in the example below that, due to the extra weight of the model, there is an extra amount of material on the dress, so the actual size and shape of the dress is much larger than the model, and the real amount of clothing you wear actually fits inside the dress better! As you can see, the designer's face is covered in fabric, which is all that remains of the model for the dress to show!

This would be a major change for the brand - would any of their existing customers not buy the dress from them in its actual true form and size, rather than just purchasing a tiny piece of fabric or a tiny figure made of synthetic parts made of rubber and a paint pigment? Would that impact their brand value, and/or their stock value? Well, that is something we should discuss in more detail in the next chapter! ;-)

So let's go back to the example given - let's say you have been studying 3D models designed by the Balenciaga designer, but you would prefer not to buy the clothes from the brand (since there are certain factors like the size, color, and amount of fabric on the dress that are unaccounted for by the clothing designer, and that is not the same as the size of the dress itself! )
Would you still make the choice to buy the dress and buy the fabric instead? In a world where we can "ride" the curvature of space-time, would you still make the choice to buy the dress and not buy the fabric? Would you even want to buy the fabric? To answer these question, let's take the following example:

Let us assume that you already have a 3D model of a model with the actual size, color, and fabric color we want! Now let's also assume that we own a 3D mannequin that has the same body weight and height and is similar in weight to the actual designer's model! Then let's examine how the two styles of clothing, and the

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the same phenomenon that caused people to believe in ghosts actually has real origins in physics! So where did ghosts come from? Why did they form at all in the first place?

First, let's address the very basic question of what ghosts are, and why most people feel the need to believe in these strange objects. We have already touched on the idea of energy, and that energy is what creates the structure we experience when we see things and experience various kinds of sensations. Once we have talked about energy it is time to get a good look at the structure of objects in that energy!

First, let's talk about what ghosts are. A ghost is a special form of energy that can't be observed by us in this lower dimensional universe. As a result, we have to make assumptions about it to explain its existence. Let's say we thought ghosts consisted of black holes or some sort of dark energy. Which of these do we think was the answer? Both! These concepts are very similar in terms of conceptually what they are, but one is in a lower dimension (black holes are in the lower dimensional universe), while the other is an upper dimensional entity (dark energy is in the upper dimensional universe). Both concepts are described by certain laws; black holes and dark energy are described by laws of physics, and Ghosts describe laws of ghosts! In other words, we need to figure out which of these concepts is correct and explain the underlying processes that create ghosts so that we understand and explain the phenomena. Of course, we have already found out the answer to our initial question - ghosts are created/existing by gravitational forces, and energy density created by gravity creates the gravitational field that causes them to exist. We can't be too sure, because the physics of gravity in other dimensions is quite different than we are used to...

On this particular subject, there are actually two very useful concepts: category theory and category logic. The latter is used a lot while discussing ghosts, but it might be helpful to know what they are before we explore both of them together. Category logic is a mathematical concept used to deal with the notion of a single, unordered set of things. In other words, let's say there are certain rules for how these objects can act together, and what things can cause other things to happen. Let's say we have 5 things, 4 of which can change the location of other 3 things. So let's say there are 5 rules that regulate how the 5 things act together in the 5 ways! In other words, the 5 rules define an ordering principle for the things. In physics, the name for this ordering principle is called category.

Well, let's apply this to ghosts and how it relates to our current subject! We already know that energy can create any number of things; as we talk about it, there are various forms of energy. One form is called dark energy. A similar form of energy - energy density in the form of stars and planets - is called dark matter. Then we have to consider the fifth form of energy - ghosts. For simplicity, let's do a general assumption on the existence of ghosts here: they are energy densities - there are no individual ghosts, but there are collections of ghosts; however, we don't know exactly how many ghosts there are, and how many of them interact with each other. Let's assume that every single piece of matter in the universe emits ghosts and that every single piece of an object also emits ghosts when it is acted upon, but we obviously haven't got all the data on every single individual piece! We only know the number of ghosts that are emitted when every object is acted upon - this is called the number of ghosts emitted by an object: this number is called the number of ghosts created by an object.

One thing that happens when there are more ghosts than other objects - things tend to move slower, and gravity tends to have different effects on things depending on what they are - is called category theory! Let's imagine that we were to take a slice of 3+1 dimensional space from all the possible points of the slice. Let's label these vertices by t (time), x (space), and y (space), and now we have a bunch of different ways

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the nature of the physical world is incredibly complex! There are physical laws based on our perception and understanding of the world, but beyond that, it's impossible to fully predict how objects might move and behave depending on how they're placed and how they interact with each other. In this chapter we will explore some of the key ideas behind the complexity of our world, such as gravity, energy, and matter, and how the way we perceive this mysterious array of entities might actually impact the way we understand our world in general.

The first insight to consider is what we call gravity. Gravitational forces are the major force we experience in everyday life and are the cause behind the motion of objects around us. As we move, we experience acceleration, which is proportional to our mass/momentum and is caused by the repulsive force of the surrounding "gravitator". This force works very differently depending on how massive we are, as it applies to smaller masses and larger masses at the same time.

Gravity is fundamentally different in an infinitely wide 3+1 dimensional universe, where it can exist everywhere. In our 3D universe, we think it acts as a constant force pulling particles of different masses and velocities together. However in infinitely wide 3D space, it doesn't apply to particles coming from all directions. It does apply to massive particles, but we can only see massive particles moving towards us at a given instant. We can then determine the direction of the vector that the particle is pointing. The formula for the moment of inertia of a particle is I = m(m × I)/d², where m is the mass of the particle and I is the particle's moment of inertia. So the smaller part of this formula is the mass of the particle, and the bigger part is the sum over all its moment of inertia, as represented by the square root function.

The amount of mass a particle experiences depends on how close to the center it is. This is because the higher its mass the more distance it experiences before the center of mass of the universe attains its maximum velocity - and this velocity has to slow down as the particle encounters other higher mass particles. And since we know that objects tend to move in straight lines and in uniform orbits around the center of mass of the universe, we can deduce the mass m of objects as the velocity of the center v c multiplied by I. Therefore m = d· v c /dt. However, this velocity is not constant in 3D space; this is because we are moving at constant speed in three-dimensions but the speed of the center varies depending on how our object is placed in 3D space. Therefore we cannot measure the mass m of objects accurately with the exact same object at the beginning of each experiment! That means it is impossible to predict the exact location of an object or a particle at any given time using any mathematical theory.

But it is possible to use mathematics to explain things in a more quantitative way. The most common mathematical formulation for predicting the mass m of a particle in a given moment can be written as:

The formula comes from the Lagrangian of any Lagrangian system composed of at least a particle and a potential energy function with minimum at the center of mass. Let's say a particle is in a potential energy function of the form $V(x,\vec v)$. The potential energy function contains the mass of the particle and the distance it experiences from the center of mass while it is moving. The potential energy function describes how our object is constrained by gravity to move in a particular direction. Now our particle experiences forces along different directions because it has different rest mass/momentum - it's mass is proportional to its velocity squared.

Note that we can easily calculate the mass m that a 3+1 dimensional object feels at any moment of time based on our position in 3D space. Let's suppose we're in a room with two opposite walls at constant height, and the bottom wall is stationary. The top wall has a height that is twice as great as the bottom wall, and we assume it also has mass at rest that is twice the mass of the bottom wall. (We'll get into this next time!) Then mass for the top wall at any given moment of time can be calculated as follows:

The vertical and horizontal components of acceleration, denoted by a, and

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this section, let's imagine you as a member of the ENFJ personality type. Your IQ score is 160 and your academic achievements are impressive! What's a few months worth of homework? Well, let's say it equals 6 problems worth of 80 points each (6 x 80 = 160) (see Appendix A). Then how many hours of homework would you set aside a month to accomplish? Well let's say it equals 6 days worth of 200 points each, (see Appendix B), or a month of 240 points. Or even a year of 180 points?
As a summary of this concept, let's say that your grade point average is 5. This means you are above average in your abilities, and your IQ score is the average number of points you can get (160) over all test scores within your school at 5 points (5 x 160 = 290). In other words, your IQ score is your basic ability to effectively work at math. For most students, these kinds of scores are impressive. But what about those who are behind in math education?

The reason these students get below average SAT scores is when they are taught from the bottom-up. Essentially, it happens because most of these students learn their math from books and their teachers. So instead of teaching the mathematical concepts and applying them directly to real-world problems (which is actually where the skills come in), most of their teachers just give them the facts and math facts as they want them to remember. As such, they are not taught how to apply the learned concepts to problems that are real-world problems.

Another way to get low SAT scores is when we tell our students how to do math, teach them how to learn math and teach them how to remember, then tell them later on (sometimes in the middle of high school) how to apply the math they learned. This is why so many math tutors fail to deliver the results they were supposed to. This is why they end up teaching the same thing over and over again to the same group of kids (in the same classroom) and expecting them to learn different things, and then expecting them to forget about what they've taught them...

But if we're forced to go into our mathematical reasoning skills, how many of us are actually using these concepts correctly? Well the answer may surprise you; quite a lot probably! Math isn't your domain. But imagine yourself as researching (and sometimes even writing up) an article on some problem that you have just encountered.

This new problem that you've encountered could be the same problem you studied in class a few months ago - yet to be solved! (The problem you first considered in class might now be the problem you need to solve again in high school in order to get that grade point average that you are currently getting!) However, the problem might need to change a little bit according to the questions and questions that they posed. You will have to figure out a few new formulas, and decide upon some new ways of describing the problem...


Now let's explore what mathematical thinking actually looks like. Let's use our example with a fictional paper (the problem you just solved!), to help you understand the concepts that the ENFJ personality has in common.

So let's imagine we have a fictional paper that we write about a problem that we encountered a month ago and still didn't understand (the problem the ENFJ personality is most similar to!)

We know that mathematics is something important to students and we know that students think pretty differently about this process! A lot of us think mathematics comes down to studying the written form of formulas to answer certain questions; but most of us would also probably agree that finding the answers to these questions requires a lot of more reasoning about the math. But what about figuring out how to apply the already learned mathematical concepts and understanding how we can answer questions that do not have a written form? Will the ENFJ personality share that approach?

Mathematicians can come up with formulas that are used to simplify complicated mathematical statements; but we can't really use these formulas because these formulas do not take into account our worldview, our worldviews and our worldviews (i.e. our worldview is part of these formulas!). (The fact that mathematicians have such creative minds is one of the reasons that they are

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of ENFP we will use a few mathematical symbols: the Greek alphabet, Greek numbers, and the Roman alphabet.

The Greek alphabet has 32 symbols - 16 Roman letters and 16 Greek letters.  These 32 symbols represent the total number of different letters that we have available: 28 sounds and 4 colors.

We have only 28 sounds in the Greek alphabet, so it seems clear that our alphabet consists of only 28 different characters! However, we actually have 24 sounds available, and they are categorized into two groups: one that is primarily consonants, and another that is primarily vowels. So let's make our alphabet even colder and wilder by adding a fifth letter: D. Now if we were to add a phonetic representation to each set of Greek letters, we would end up having a total alphabet consisting of 56 different letters!

We have 28 sounds and 4 colors available in the Greek alphabet, and 28 sounds are used to represent the 28 different sounds. Additionally, each Greek letter is associated with exactly one color.  Thus, the sounds, colors, and letters for the Greek alphabet are all mutually exclusive.  So the sounds, colors, and letters for our alphabet are also mutually exclusive!

Given these mutually exclusive conditions, no two different letters can share the same color. This means that you can never see the same letter in black and white!

We can now also use Greek numbers to represent each letter in our alphabet.  Each Greek number represents a separate letter in the Greek alphabet - each number represents one letter which is either consonants or vowels!

Each sound in the Greek alphabet is associated with a number - all words produced using the Greek alphabet have precisely that number of sounds! This means that no different Greek number can share the same number of sounds - no two different sounds can combine with any other sounds! Similarly, each vowel is associated with a number - any words produced using the Greek alphabet have precisely that number of vowels!

There are some key rules you need to know about the Greek alphabet that will help us understand the ENFP concept best.  For example, as we'll see in the first of the next two chapters, an ENFP person likes to keep their mind and body on the same constant - this means that they are more likely to memorize rather than understand words and concepts. This means of course that they will need to remember each sound, color, and letter in our Greek alphabet! This means that even though most people will naturally produce multiple words using our alphabet, the average ENFP individual will only produce one word per day - and it will be a word similar to our own! In other words, we're guaranteed to receive a perfect translation of one of our own words - the same word that we created and memorized so well!

To put this into more detail, an ENFP person will be the most efficient person on their own if they focus on performing some single task as quickly and efficiently as possible - they don't need to spend their time on thinking about any other aspect of their lives! And remember, time is more important than words - as you know, words and concepts tend to be useless with time - as long as you keep thinking about them, your brain can be perfectly saturated! This means that you should use all the symbols in your alphabet that help you communicate; those symbols that help you understand; and those symbols that help you understand the concepts behind your words and concepts!

Let me give you a simple example of how our Greek alphabet and our Greek numbers can be used to communicate.  Take a look: if we write in our Greek alphabet A B C and D E F G H, we would not only get A CD EF G DH - but also BCD EF GH as well! This is due to the fact that the Greek alphabet contains a letter that can only be used once - only if you are doing an E-F-G-H task, you can use A to make that particular letter. Using the Greek alphabet in this manner means that the word you can say A CD EF G DH will be identical in meaning to A CD G BF G DH, so it will be perfectly understandable! This means that the person can communicate with them in the following ways:

A C E F G D B C D E F G H

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity and diversity of human minds and bodies, mathematicians have attempted to model and uncover the intricate and abstract human mindset. In this chapter we will look at several different mathematical models of the human mind - both human and animal based models, based on the fact that human brains have become so complex that it is no longer useful to use traditional tools to help solve mathematical puzzles!

What does it mean to say that "mathematicians have attempted to model and uncover the intricate and abstract human minds?" Well, in this chapter we will discuss the way in which animals and humans solve mathematical puzzles using various psychological theories. This in itself opens up several intriguing possibilities including possible ways in which animals and humans share similar mechanisms for solving certain types of mathematical puzzles, and how people and animals may have completely different cognition when solving computational and symbolic problems - as is the case in our brains!!!

In this chapter we'll also look at two different versions of mathematical models that attempt to unravel why things such as the ability to read, think mathematically, remember and even learn mathematically go wrong for some people. As part of this research, we also will look at mathematical models that attempt to explain and predict the ability to learn new mathematical concepts...

A mathematical model is something we can use to create mathematical algorithms, equations, and equations out of other mathematically-related materials - all based on rules. These models can be very helpful in understanding mathematical concepts (such as arithmetic and symbolic mathematics) as well as mathematically-related phenomena (such as logic and computation). Because the structure of a mathematical model involves specific rules that can be used to interpret a concept or phenomenon, it is an incredibly powerful tool in understanding the way humans process and solve problems - but only one can ever learn to use the methods behind a mathematical model!

It turns out that there are several approaches and ways in which mathematical models have been invented over the years. Some models are based on a mathematical framework that only describes the mathematical concepts in terms of rules and mathematical notations, while other models try to look at the cognitive process from a psychological perspective. There seems to be a difference in the way in which people think about mathematics and arithmetic. Here are two different models that attempt to explain and predict the way humans think about mathematically-related concepts - let's leave the question of a difference in thinking about mathematics to future chapters.

Models in Mathematics Education

It's interesting to note that not only do the two models in this chapter attempt to address how people think about mathematically-related concepts, but also that both models are based on one primary premise - that people need to think about mathematical concepts in a symbolic way - otherwise they can't learn them properly.

Mathematically-related concepts are things that are clearly separated from one another but come from the same source; they are defined by symbols. So for example, numbers can be defined as numbers - numbers that can be expressed geometrically as a single point in three dimensions; but numbers that are defined by mathematical notations often don't have this geometric meaning. In mathematical terms, numbers are symbols; and mathematical notations are symbols that are attached to numbers to make them more meaningful. Mathematicians have attempted to model the way people think about numbers. This model was first created some fifty years ago. One of the founders of this model, Paul Searle, said that the mathematically-related concept of "number" was like "wooden clippings" that would "be useful when it arrived." According to him, most people aren't comfortable thinking abstractly when it comes to mathematically-related concepts - they prefer to think abstractly about what looks like numbers directly in print.  Mathematically-related concepts are usually defined in symbolic form - which means that when we first learn about them, we can simply "attach" these symbols to numbers so that they become more meaningful.  

When we think about things such as numbers, it turns out that what we are actually thinking more is "relationships." So the mathematically-related concept of "relationship" is, in fact, a relationship between numbers. While numbers are usually defined as symbols, relationships can be defined as symbols attached to numbers and thus become more meaningful to us during the process of learning math

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict mathematics and to better explain how to use it to make useful predictions in scientific and engineering problems, it is sometimes useful to understand how mathematical concepts are used to describe behavior. As we have seen in the last chapter, the concept of dimension allows us to explain the behavior of particles under various circumstances.

So the next question is how do we find out how a particular mathematical concept relates to behavior?

Well you can find that out using a simple experiment! As we all know, experiments result in data that can be used to make accurate predictions. In this case, we want to find out how a particular mathematical concept relates to the behavior of an object's movement through different dimensions. If we can answer this simple question, then we can make more accurate predictions about how a particular mathematical concept relates to a particular object's behavior.

What exactly is the concept of motion in mathematics? Well we may as well just call it the concept of movement. Since the concept is based on math, you could call it motion. Motion is basically a process through space and time - the movement of a thing or an entity. If a thing in one place becomes a moving entity in another, it is called "moving through space and time". Similarly, when a thing or an entity changes its motion at any given instant - it is called "drifting through space and time".

Let's start by considering the question "How far can an entity travel". In Newtonian mechanics, this question is answered by finding the length of time it would take the object to move 1 inch across the room - which is the same thing as saying how quickly it travels one inch across that room. However, in relativistic mechanics, there is more flexibility on this - instead of being a 1 inch length scale, we use the length of light! In other words, the speed of light is the speed of a thing as is moving through time (which we call the speed of light!). So at each instant, the speed of a thing is based on the speed of light and other physical properties such as mass! Thus, relativistic mechanics allows us to have a much tighter correspondence between the speed of the thing as it moves through space-time and the speed of light itself. Because relativistic mechanics allows for more flexibility in moving a thing through space-time than Newtonian mechanics, this makes the results of an experiment easier to interpret: since the speed of a thing as it moves through space-time seems to follow the speed of light and other physical properties more closely than using the length of one inch length scale, we would expect the speed of the thing as it moves through relativistic and Newtonian mechanics to be the same.

Well, this seems to be the case - at least according to scientists. As we mentioned earlier, the speed of light in relativistic mechanics should be the same as that of a mass moving through relativistic spacetime! But again, this isn't the case! In fact...it is actually a very different picture. Let's consider an example...

Let's assume that the "black box" we're discussing is a black hole. In black holes, we can find a minimum energy, and so the black hole is in an energetically unbalanced state at all times. This means that it will always rotate through the z axis, as shown in Figure 1.

While the black hole can always move through space and time, it won't necessarily stay in one place in the same frame forever. Instead it will come to rest at some point, and return to a resting condition. This process is called rotational equilibrium...at any given time the black hole will be moving in a curved spacetime, but it will always end up rotating toward a stationary frame.

Since rotation and acceleration are the two fundamental concepts used to describe the motion of things in space-time, let me show how they relate one to the other.

First, it is important to note that we always experience gravitational forces - if a thing is thrown away from a black hole, it is going to experience a gravitational pull to come back! In space and time, this is often called a gravity. We call such objects "gravitational points" - which will be discussed later in this chapter. At a gravitational point, there are no other objects in the universe. The gravitational

To better depict your thinking in mathematics, I would suggest creating a board of color-coded squares (or circles) in your Math notebook. Each square represents a mathematical concept that you are currently practicing. The first thing you need to do is decide where the squares are in your Math notebook. If you have one page per Math concept - like for example in case of the first part in this chapter (the geometry of the line), we would place 9 of the first 9 squares on the first page and 10 of the second 9 squares on the second page. If you don't have that much space to practice some concepts, you can always choose more squares to place on the front, back, or sides of your book. (Just remember that the bigger your book, the longer it takes to locate objects on your page and read them all). Now, it's time to practice!
Once you create your board of squares, go ahead and practice! This isn't a full exercise just yet - you will need to practice at home and in the library. For homework, you can just choose the concepts you already know and practise your answers until you are comfortable doing it! This is called "self-directed practice" and it is the best way for practice. Don't worry, though - a quick Google search should get you started!
Also, don't forget to take some tests to see where you are at, so that you understand where you are and work along with the teacher from there! As we work on the concepts in this chapter, I'll always keep an idea of where to take the tests and where to go from there, and as we complete the tasks, I'll go over the tests for you!

Now, let us discuss the different types of mathematical knowledge that we need to practice with! I understand that some mathematicians will like to think of them in some sort of neat order - let's talk about this first.

Boolean Algebra
Boolean Algebra is a sub-part of the first four Mathematical Subjects. It is useful because many different kinds of problems arise in mathematical problems, including problems involving equations - which are written in Boolean notation.

Number Theory
Number theory is a sub-part of the fifth Mathematical Subjects. It is useful because it comes after the other sub-formulas and sub-concepts.
Linear Algebra
Linear Algebra is a sub-part of the fourth Mathematical Subjects. It is useful because we can use Linear Algebra to solve problems involving equations and matrices.

Algebraic Number Theory
Algebraic Number Theory is a sub-part of the Algebraic Methods, which I mentioned in Chapter One. It is useful because it comes after Linear Algebra and Geometry.

Number Functions and Functions of Numerical Variables
Mathematical Functions and Functions of Numerical Variables:
The first thing I would like to discuss is Functions and Functions of Numerical Variables. For now, let's assume that all your classmates are familiar with the concept of a function of a numeric variable. This is because in all of our lessons there are examples of functions and other mathematical statements that involve some sort of a numeric variable

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematics in our current lives, maybe it's a good idea to go back to the books that we once used as references - and we could begin to see more clearly what we currently put into a mathematical formula and when we apply it! We'll just have to see how we apply it in everyday life now...

Let's begin by applying the theory of complex numbers to something we already know - the equation of the zodiac.

Now let's discuss complex numbers more closely to better clarify what we are doing here - let's look at this equation in more detail.

We can also use this equation to create several mathematical objects. We've also simplified the equation to make it easier to understand - let's see what we have left!

As we can see from the figure, the zodiac consists of 12 constellations (the 12 constellations themselves can also be treated as 12 different dimensions), 12 planets, and 10 stars. We'll use this definition to define the set we're working with:

Now let's use these four numbers to create several other mathematical objects - we'll take this set of numbers and turn it into a list, which we'll call a cube!

As we see from the figure, three of these cubes are identical - they all have the same 3+1 dimensional geometry, they have exactly the same number of sides, and they all have exactly the same number of edges. Let's look at each one to get a better understanding!

As we're going along with this process, it turns out that we can actually use the cube's 4 sides and edges to calculate its volumes. Let's now move on to calculating the lengths of these sides and edges....

Lastly, we'll calculate the amount of mass left in this cube and determine what we can call the mass of this cube!

So far, we've learned some very basic concepts about mathematical objects, and this has given us some great first steps in figuring out how we should apply the theory of complex numbers to our current lives. However, the most important thing yet is to remember that the theory of complex numbers is only one thing, but many others play an important role in our everyday lives - and it's up to us to find them and use them!

Now let's see how we've used complex numbers to determine the size of our zodiac! Since these four numbers are the same across the whole zodiac, this simple calculation will give us all 12 dimensions in our current lifetime!!

Let's look at a more complicated situation - our zodiac and all of its dimensions are intertwined - their shapes are closely connected to one another! That's why all of these math objects can also be considered part of each other.

Now when we look at our zodiac, we can see that its shape consists of two triangles: one at top and bottom, and one on the left and right. Let's call this triangle the "main triangle", we'll also call this triangle the "triangles at the top" (or the "main triangle triangle" for short) because it's what we need to calculate the dimensions of our current zodiac!

To calculate the size of the sides and edges, we use the first formula that was mentioned earlier. We have two sides each and eight edges, so let's calculate our three dimensions: the dimension of our main triangle, the dimension of the triangles at the top of our main triangle, and the dimension of all 8 edges we have on our main triangle!

In general, we can find the size of our sides and edges using the following formula:

This formula includes the area of our triangles; this is because they are all triangles! If we are working with two triangles, our final formula will simply be:

So in total, we can determine our sides and edges by just adding up each individual area and dividing each individual area by the total of their corresponding area times the total size of the square (the area of each individual piece of geometry times the total area of the square).

So, let us now get the area of our main triangle!

Because of how our main triangle is connected to all of its dimensions, we can use the following formula to calculate our main triangle's area:

Now let's get the sum of the areas of all of our main triangles! The final formula is:

Again, this entire process is very simple to understand by

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict and describe our way of thinking in mathematics, we are going to use a simplified term, the ESTJ Cognitive Functions Model (EFM). The EFM is a mathematical model that tries to represent and explain what we normally think and how our thinking is structured. As this chapter explains, there is a wide variety of thoughts that people think and how they think that we normally think. However, the EFM has the clear advantage of being straightforward to understand and simple to describe what we generally think. The EFM is quite similar to a tree: everything in this tree is divided into different branches and different smaller branches. All of these branches are joined together to form the leaf that represents our thinking. This represents what we normally think and how we normally think and what we think in particular mathematical topics...

Let's start by looking at some general concepts from this tree. Let's use the following terminology to give us a sense of what this representation entails:

Tree: The basic structure of the EFM is a simple tree in which some of the different components of a mathematical concept are represented by leaves - all of these leafs form the main part of the tree that we normally think.
Leaf: This is represented by a dot on the EFM's left side, which represents a node. In the figure below we have created a leaf called "sum - the addition - of the number". This is one of the mathematical concepts that we normally think and believe. The symbol at the left hand side of this leaf represents a node in the tree and represents a mathematical concept called "sum".

Root: This is the "parent" of the EFM, which is used to create a whole new mathematical concept with the right answer. In order to create a new mathematical concept, it is important to split the concept down into smaller and smaller parts and then try to reconstruct the parent under its new new smaller parts.
Figure 14.1 - The EFM's basic structure - This is a simplified version of the tree, but it helps us get a better picture of what the EFM is and how it works as expected.

Root node
Sum

Root parent
Leaf 1
Leaf 2
Leaf 3

Leaf 1 is a subnode of Leaf 2, which is a subnode of Leaf 3, and so on. So this leaves represent our mental models of mathematics concepts. Each mathematical concept starts out by sitting at a very general level of abstractness - it is a single larger mathematical concept - and then it is split down in smaller parts and then is reconstructed under these smaller parts. Then, based on which smaller parts are reconstructed correctly, the larger part can be constructed! For example, if "sum" is the largest mathematical concept, the most accurate way to reconstruct the sum is by moving the sum node down and down until it touches the leaf that looks like a square. Similarly, the most accurate way to reconstruct "times as integers" is by moving down the leaf that looks like a triangle. From one such mathematical notion you can create a new mathematical notion, such as the construction of "fraction". Similarly, when you create "divide equation", you can create a new mathematical notion from this and so on.

We have also used a different method to try to simplify the basic structure of our thinking. Using this simplification method, we can not only create better mathematical concepts, but also understand the general layout of the EFM and it's purpose. The following chart shows what the EFM looks like after this simplification method. Here, we have created an additional node to show the "parent" (also known as "root") of our thinking and created 2 more leaves in the "leaf 1" and "leaf 2" nodes to represent our new created mathematical concepts...

Root: This shows what the EFM looks like after the "leaf 1" and "leaf 2" leaves are removed. This is our new root, which is now represented by our new mathematical concept called "sum".

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the complexity of higher dimensional realities for us, let's first look at how space-time looks like in lower dimension and then explain how it changes in higher dimensions.
Let's start at the lowest level of math. If you use Newton's laws to analyze a particle in the lower dimensions of spacetime, it will always move in straight lines - no turning or swaying, no jiggles - just like everything in lower dimension. If you consider the same particle in higher dimensions, you will see how it will become jiggly and wobble - it is a bit harder and a bit more complicated to analyze!

To analyze the motions of particles in lower dimension, we can calculate the acceleration, velocity vector, curvature, etc. of each point on their trajectory, and then use those to express their motion.

It's important to note that these calculations can be very complicated to perform when considering smaller-sized (i.e. smaller scale) objects (i.e. particles) that can be studied using more simplistic forms of math. This is because there are no variables like velocity, acceleration, curvature, etc. to express each small object as, and there are no constants like gravity that apply to objects larger than our bodies!

To analyze the motions of particles in higher dimensions, we need to calculate all of these variables simultaneously. This is because we can only analyze objects and their motions in these higher dimensions by combining them together - but there are more variables affecting them than there are in lower dimension! In order to keep the calculations as simple as possible, we can start by reducing the variables to just a single axis.  Let's say we are interested in examining a particle's motion in Dimension X. Suppose we are interested in the speed (speed, s) of the particle. Because in lower dimensions, all objects move in straight lines, it would be easy to analyze how the speed varies with time (t). To do this, we would divide the time axis by the speed and look at the resulting curve.

On the other hand, once we started to allow for higher dimensions - now called higher space or higher dimension - then the calculation becomes more difficult. You need to change variables in your calculations! You need to start with three variables - the speed (speed, s), the acceleration (acceleration,a), and the curvature (curvature, c), and then divide all of these by the three to express the velocity vector (v) - and once we have obtained the velocity vector, we can find the acceleration (for later), curvature (for later), etc. by combining the acceleration, curvature, and speed together in a single number.

The reason that the calculations become significantly more complex when we consider higher space or higher dimensions isn't because of difficulty. This is because these higher-dimensional objects and their motions are much more complicated to analyze than the objects and motions in lower-dimensional space or dimensions when they are small enough. At higher spaces and higher dimensions, the particles and motions aren't only complicated to analyze, they're also often very large! For example, consider, let's say, a sphere that's 10 kilometers wide and 100 kilometers tall! This would be about 0.001 kilometers in diameter and 1000 kilometers wide and long! It's almost impossible to analyze these two objects mathematically in their entirety using our modern mathematical formalism.

For these reasons, it is important to understand what it means to "manage" objects when analyzing motion in higher dimensions. Like any mathematical calculations, you need to divide all of those variables into smaller parts so that they can be handled in a more analytical fashion. Let's say I want to discuss how an object in Dimension X can get from one place to another by measuring the acceleration (acceleration, a), curvature (curvature, c), speed (speed, s), and distance traveled (distance, d). Let's take a sphere made of 100 kilometers with a radius of 0.001 kilometers and cut it into six parts! Now let's call the six smaller parts A, B, C, D, E, and F. Let's call the total of the six smaller parts Z, but let's keep adding them together by a (= 100 - 1) to see how the total acceleration (acceleration, a = 50), curvature (ac = 100 -

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the way we see various entities and the way they affect each other, let's start with one of the oldest and well known personality types: the enneagram.

The Enneagram is a five-point measurement of personality based on two separate sets of adjectives ("positive" and "negative" behaviors) and their associated ratings of strength (on ten-point scales - 0 to 9). Each of the five personality areas can be combined to give us the Big Five! In this way, it is possible to see how the personality types combine and how they interact one another.

Unfortunately, it has been proven that enneagramming is not a fair method of assigning personality types. Researchers have studied over 300,000 people and found that only 13% of people fit into the personality profile they assigned to them. In addition, the enneagram has a great deal of overlap between various personality profiles - for example, a person can be called "positive" on their first personality profile, but "negative" on their second, and vice versa.

However, there are two key features that make the enneagram stand out. First, the enneagram isn't one dimensional - it does not divide human personality into fixed categories. On the contrary the enneagram divides human personality into groups, or enneagram archetypes - which is important for understanding how people interact. These archetypes include

Neutral - the person is neither "positive" nor "negative" towards others
Aggressive - a person is typically both "positive" and "negative" towards others
Submissive - a person is typically both "negative" and "positive" towards others

So when we refer to an entity using its enneagram archetype name as opposed to its actual personality name, we mean the personality type that the entity fits best...like, for example, a person could be called "neutral" on their first personality profile, but "hard to get along with" on their second enneagram personality profile.

The other thing that makes the enneagram stand out is how the archetypes can be grouped into four basic personality categories - A-G - that describe different aspects of the personality...one is associated with the positive side of the personality; the second is with the negative side; the third is neutral; and the fourth is associated with an inability to express emotions and feelings.

Of course, while the "positive" and "negative" behaviors are listed, there is an underlying set of underlying characteristics within each behavior that dictate the manner in which the behavior is expressed.

These underlying characteristics can refer to any number of things, but I'll be focusing primarily on 4 - "emotional intelligence," "perspective-taking,"
"affirmative awareness," and "expressing one's feelings."

When we talk about "emotional intelligence", we are referring to the human ability to understand the underlying emotions and feelings of others. The term "emotional intelligence" is also used for the ability to interpret others' meaning systems. In reality, all of us can clearly sense what a person is thinking and feeling - it's just that the way we make sense of this internal representation is called "inner self". In other words, most of us are so used to being "self aware" that we find it somewhat hard to recognize the thoughts and feelings that are in our own heads...which is why most people struggle with "emotional intelligence."

The next behavior we would like to talk about is "perspective-taking" - this is the ability to notice how we're doing things and where we are in the process of performing them. One would assume that this behavior is related to "clarity" in one's experience; it would follow that when we feel more comfortable with the people, the information that we are communicating around would be clearer. However, this is not entirely true - it turns out that perspective-taking behavior is also a manifestation of how people interpret themselves and their surroundings in light of their beliefs...


Finally, what we've come to focus on in this chapter is "expressive your feelings." This, and the last of the four features within enneagram theory, is what defines what people are; we don't see them

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the way humans use sound waves, we have created a musical notation called "Loudness Diagram", which we will discuss below.

A Loudness Diagram is a graph displaying the relationship between the intensity of a sound of certain frequencies and sound wave velocity - where a sound with a higher frequency, a higher velocity, and a more "sloppy" path will make for a loud sound.
You can see that humans use the same Loudness Diagrams as birds (a higher frequency, lower velocity, and rougher path). Birds use their own Loudness Diagrams to determine what kind of food to choose for feeding - birds of different species all use Loudness Diagrams that are slightly different according to how they plan to "ride" their own preferred sound pathways!

A few notes about this notation before we dive into the music itself: When a sound is created, the wave is created at a certain wavelength, or depth; the sound begins to propagate at a higher velocity and speed in the direction of the wave. The sound then propagates at a lower velocity and speed back toward the source, in a direction away from the wavefront. The lower the wavelength, the slower the propagation. In fact, wavelengths of 500 and 1,000 microns are the lowest that can be measured, so it is easy to create an illusion of space by simply projecting a high frequency sound wave onto an object with a large wavelength. Let's use this to visualize the difference between higher frequencies (and higher velocities) and lower frequencies (and lower velocities):

Imagine if you could send your wave up into the air. You can actually do this. In fact, this is the basic premise behind an incredibly successful tech that uses sound waves for wireless transmission - the soundwave technology! (Please click on my bio for more about this tech - if you don't have an account at GitHub - please download and sign up for an account). The sound wave technology makes it incredibly easy for users to send audio and video messages via the internet - and at the same time - allows the transmission of very small bits of data on top of the sound.

Let's use this soundwave tech to create a simple Loudness Diagram. The "Sound Frequency" is a line with four edges, numbered A, B, C, and D - you can guess what direction these edges point to in the following image:

The "Loudness" line is formed by putting various frequencies around A (high), B (medium), C (low), and D (no sound) and connecting them using straight lines. So every color on the Loudness line represents a different sound frequency, and everything should turn off once you reach color D.

We can now try this method on our favorite video game, Mortal Kombat 11. We are sending our audio signal up into the air and it gets amplified and travels through the waves of space to hit the target! Here is a graph of our Loudness Diagram at the end of the video:

As you can see, the loudness of mortal Kombat 10 is actually extremely loud (A and B color) and the Loudness Diagram at the start of the video is extremely quiet (D color). The loudness on the Loudness Diagram for Mortal Kombat 11 is actually slightly lower, but still higher than Mortal Kombat 10. As you can see, Mortal Kombat 11 shows some sort of Loudness Density.

Now let's switch to a more technical perspective on this. The Loudness Diagram has different colors and corresponding lines that represent different levels of loudness. The lines that correspond to colors 0 and 1 represent Loudness of 1,000 decibels. The lines that correspond to colors 2 and 3 (from the start of the video) are corresponding to a Loudness of 0 dB. Now, if we connect the red and blue lines, as shown in the middle of this image, we get a straight line representing 0 dB Loudness. Now what would happen if we take the same image by splitting up our line at a point midway down the line, and connecting the two lines at the midpoint (we will call this D line)? Well, that would have produced a line

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the basic idea behind this chapter is that as the number of objects or entities you have grows, so do your theories of how these objects behave. And, eventually there will be a theory that explains all of reality in a satisfactory manner. We hope that this chapter will prove it to you.

Consider the following four-dimensional space-time diagram:

It can be seen by any 4D observer that the space-time is four dimensional and has an infinite number of dimensions.
Now in the last few chapters, we've worked out a set of general laws that describe the basic behavior of objects in any of the above four-dimensional spaces. These are usually called laws of motion. And it turns out that since objects are influenced by each other and others in the universe, these laws of motion will provide an explanation of how objects can behave in the presence of other objects and other forces. The laws contain specific equations for each object, but these equations simply sum up to a single set of equations where all four objects are affected by each other and the external forces in the same equation. In other words, every object can in theory be described by this set of equations, and these equations can help us understand how objects interact with each other and how forces and forces work in the universe.

Now imagine that you work out your theories for every object that you own - even if you aren't sure about every part of its equation! Then it would be easy for you to determine that all of the equations of all of the objects you know about fit together beautifully once you add up everything that you didn't know about - and you might be able to even figure out what's going on with every single object! At least you could take each equation you knew about and figure out how they fit together.

This is where some of the greatest achievements in science come to life - because the laws provide an incredibly simple way to explain our everyday experience. In many cases it comes down to simple mathematics - for instance, the equation for a particle moving in straight lines, as opposed to having to take into account other factors, is the same equation that you would use to describe whether or not a particle behaves in accordance with Newton's third law!

But sometimes it cannot be simplified like in the example for the particle we just considered. This is basically where the theory of homotopy type comes into play - it's important to remember that in each dimension, there are certain homotopy types that are unique to that particular dimension. But there is also a certain type of homotopy that covers all of these types of homotopy - the homotopy type of the four-dimensional space-time itself!

As we can see, the homotopy type of 4D space-time is a continuous field of all four-dimensional spaces! But what about other spatial dimensions? 

The last paragraph of this chapter will go into detail on homotopy theory - it is a very important subject and one that we want you to be familiar with! But we now want to return to our space-time diagram above and ask you to determine which space-typical homotopy type the above four-dimensional space really is. What can you say about the fact that the space is four dimensional and has an infinite number of dimensions, exactly when homotopy type theory predicts that the space-time must be four dimensional?

In other words, is the space four dimensional and has an infinite number of dimensions, and why?

A:

The question of why four-dimensionality exists, but not three-dimensionality or more, is part of the mystery.  On the surface of it it seems strange, it's like in physics, you can go from four-dimensionality (really five-dimensionality) and one dimension (the actual dimension we experience) to two dimensions, and back to one dimension and back again.  It's not, and I don't think it can ever be, possible for a thing to go back to zero.
I think the mystery begins when we go from a two dimensional world (think of a two-dimensional plane in a three-dimensional world) to three dimensions (think of a cube).  Why a world that can go from two dimensions to three dimensions.  Even if we were to go back to one dimension and back again, I think we can't figure out why.  Why is the world made of two dimensions and one dimension?  Why did we choose to go

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the concepts we have just seen in the previous chapters, let's take a look at an example of a good game design. Consider a video game with a single player character with no weapons. In the game, the only way that a player could access weapons would be by hitting a key in the console, like the famous Fist of Fenix in The Warrior Prince...but that's exactly what it would take to destroy the ship! So what if our character could learn some sort of skill that would allow them to attack or defend themselves using their unique abilities instead of having to use the console?

Of course, this is only possible if our character, which is a hero, can somehow gain the magical ability to transform into another person without having to use a key. So let us assume for a moment that there was a magical ability like some kind of mind control; that person or spirit controlling the character could transform into the exact same person as the original one. Then they would be able to attack and defend themselves with the same weapons that the original person used without having to use the console!

However, we need to be very careful in assigning magical abilities to our heroes - magic is not something we are free to do! It can only be activated through ritual activities that involve the creation, sacrifice, or use of magical creatures, and a powerful magician that is able to manipulate the creatures' essence. To put it all back into context, if one had an entire army of fire-monsters, the game would be just as much fun as if we took the battlefield into our own hands, destroying the opponents ship and taking their entire army...but we really need to be very cautious when assigning magical abilities to our heroes!

The game in the above example could easily be broken down into many separate chapters that tell us how a hero would be able to take control of his or her own character. In other words, it's simple to think about the game as a whole without having to think about every single concept that we have been talking about in the previous chapters!

Now let's look at a game that can be broken down into multiple separate chapters, but that really helps the player understand the purpose and design of the game:

In this game, players become warriors and their weapons become the tools of their battle. Warrior must be strong, brave, and strong-willed - so if you want to win, you'll have to take the fight with a tenacity and a tenacity that you can't find in ordinary humans.

Each chapter can be broken down further to more specific sections of the game. In this example, the chapter is broken down into the combat part where the players fight against the enemies, the art and combat part where the players fight against the enemies without weapons, and the game system part. And if you want to play the game in real time, then the characters would be able to talk to each other through an NPC.

Of course, it turns out that the game was actually a good idea! Since the player controls both the characters and the game system, and must take the game system part as well as the combat part, the whole game is designed to make it easier for each player to understand and play the game without having to dive into the other parts of the game!

So, you may ask: what happens if all this sounds like a great idea, but actually it feels counterintuitive to play? Because a) the game does not contain any fighting elements, b) no weapons appear at first, and c) no fighting happens anyways because the heroes are not very strong at all at first! However, there exists a solution to both of these issues - players will be encouraged to join up with their friends and help each other if they are strong enough...and if you are willing to follow their lead, the game is not as much of a problem as it appears!

Of course, some other possible problems are that players will find the game difficult enough to keep going once and awhile and maybe even die in the process (and maybe even lose their friends during that process), but the most important thing is, when we take a deep dive into the game, we realize that there really is a solution to all of these problems!

So, what do you think

To better depict these concepts, let's imagine that we're sitting inside a large building that's divided into multiple spaces. For instance, within each of these spaces, there may be small parts of every shape and size, color, and feeling imaginable! We can imagine just one shape in each space, and perhaps hundreds of shapes of their own. In each space, there may also be many people sitting in front of small displays of what they see - one person watching a movie, another watching a show, and so on. As you can see, the structures would be very complex, so it would be challenging for an expert mathematician and computer scientist to completely understand them all and even the more experienced mathematicians wouldn't have a good idea of all the rules governing those displays.

The above is a simplified illustration of a 3D space with many objects within it! To understand these and other 3D objects better, you can take a moment to imagine that you can see everything that appears in a 3D world! There are no clouds, mountains, landslides, etc. - you see just all the objects and the way they appear to you!

One important detail (you can also see it in Chapter 4, which describes the brain and how it works) is that most of the information in the brain comes from things called sense organs - visual, auditory, and tactile. These sense organs detect a wide variety of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli - just like a person in a normal day would detect sounds, smells, and scents if they were not in an intense concentration in a particular sensory room. However, these sense organs provide just this type of information - there are other types of information that come in more subtle forms, that are not detected by these sense organs. For instance, in Chapter 4 we talked about how the shape, color, dimensions, and so on of objects cause them to appear a certain way, and that's called shape information. Now imagine that you can understand all this while just touching a particular object and not just hearing it!  How cool would that be!

Now it's on to mathematics! The world of mathematics is quite fascinating. Take this as a metaphor for a whole 3D space covered with a sheet of paper or some other object - we can imagine that it's like this 3D space is covered by a sheet on which only one object is printed! But take a look at this 3D world as just one sheet of paper! If you were to roll up this 3D space using the object you picked in your imagination, you would end up with thousands of sheets that line up like this!

Now there's a point to note here - the sheet of paper used in this metaphor is much bigger than the original 3D world - that's only to give you a visual idea of the difference. However, the sheet of paper does not come from space - it is simply the 2D equivalent of the 3D space! So even if you could accurately describe the objects that make up the original 3D world, you'd also need to describe the object you rolled the sheet up into...and this is much harder than describe the things that make up your 2D world! So if we want to learn all the rules governing objects in a 3D world, we need to study only the 2+1 dimensional mathematical world we've been introduced to in Chapter Four...

Now the point to note: even if we can fully describe how objects make up a 3+1-dimensional mathematical world, our intuition has no idea about the rules governing how these objects interact in this 2+1-dimensional world! For instance, if we were to pick up a ball and stick it into a glass, we would have no idea as to the rules that govern its motion inside this glass! And because the ball has very little mass, it's easy to imagine that in this 3D mathematical world the ball is just a blob - it doesn't have any shape beyond being a blob! However, this is far from the truth! In a 2+1 dimensional mathematics, we have an infinite list of mathematical objects that are made up of these blobs. We also have an infinite list of rules governing these blobs as they move through each one of these blobs...in other words, each mathematical object could theoretically have an infinite number of rules defined for them as they undergo motions that are different from each

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict in the next few chapters how the work of mathematicians can help us understand the world, we begin with a general introduction to cognitive functions - a science in which we think about how people reason and solve problems.

Some people believe that human beings are rational creatures, who are able to reason and evaluate ideas and evidence to make decisions on the basis of evidence. This is why mathematicians work with mathematical equations, graphs, graphs, and tables that are used extensively in everyday life. While this may sound cool, it really is difficult to tell whether someone's really thinking mathematically or just looking at graphs!

The question of what we think when we use our brains to make decisions is one that we all probably have to deal with to some degree. For example, when a consumer buys a ticket for a concert, there aren't any guarantees that she will enjoy the concert because she may have to pay a deposit, enter into a reservation, and book the ticket.

Another frequent example we see in this environment, is when parents teach math concepts through their mathematical lessons in the school. Children are taught math concepts through learning examples in the class, but the learning examples are typically not mathematically correct. That means, the children who learn examples of math concepts through learning examples probably aren't even doing math.

In other words, children in this environment tend to be at most experts in their respective subjects. They aren't experts at solving problems; they aren't experts at math! As children progress through school, they learn that there are many different concepts that come into play when making decisions - concepts that the examples in their study don't involve.

One way to help children understand what we all think when we use our brains to make decisions is to teach them mathematics. Not only do math concepts come in handy when we use them to make decisions, but they also contain concepts that students may struggle with at school - concepts like additivity, divisibility, etc.

Mathematics can help us understand how people think and make decisions - and this is especially true for people who struggle at school. This is because math is an object of observation and comparison, which is a valuable process in order to make informed decisions.

Mathematics provides many opportunities for individuals to evaluate their own skills and compare them to others in order to improve. One of the best examples of this is taking an online test - many online tests don't provide the opportunity for individuals to directly evaluate their own performance! At the end of the test, individuals can see which questions didn't get them any correct answers (so they're not a good match with the test questions); however, they can't see which questions were correct and which were not. After using mathematics to evaluate their own performance, individuals can improve their own abilities and make better decisions!

Another fun example of using mathematics in the classroom is when students take online testing for their math classes. Students who take online tests can see which questions in a particular course didn't get correct answers, but they can't see which questions were correct and which were not. After taking these online tests, students can begin to improve their mathematical abilities and make better decisions in their classes.

If you are a mathematical profiler, you may even find it hard to understand whether someone else is thinking mathematically or perhaps just using an analogy (e.g. if you're making a decision about whether another person is mentally ill, you'll be able to tell! Just because somebody is thinking mathematically doesn't mean that they are a math profiler)! I promise this would not be as fun if you were being made out to be a mathematician!

What would you tell someone who is saying that they thought mathematically? Would you say that you just thought, or would you say that you tried to use an analogy? Is it more fun for them to think mathematically or try to use an analogy? If you were to use an analogy, tell them that you were thinking about that problem! I promise you, this would be much harder for them to figure out!

I suspect we all agree that using mathematics is an effective way to help people understand how we think and make decisions!

Now let's move onto a topic that is closely linked to the previous three topics: mind-mapping.

As noted in the last chapter, mindmapping is another important area that will be covered in our subsequent

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we mean by "intelligence", here is a short example of what a cognitive process or function is.
Imagine a person whose cognitive capability is limited by his or her spatial abilities. This person will not be able to solve a complex spatial problem well until at least the third grade. In today's society, this could mean that a student with limited spatial abilities will have fewer opportunities to work in a science, technology or engineering field that requires knowledge of space.
In our everyday life, there are certain individuals who don't have good spatial skills. As a student, this might mean that you don't have an easy time understanding and remembering topics because you just can't get them completely to you. You might be hard pressed to memorize data points or key concepts, simply because they might not stay with you long enough to fully comprehend them. This could mean that you have to read more about the topic than you would naturally when you just read the material from the same source yourself!...

To illustrate the situation, let's consider the following real-life example:

Imagine the following three students (A, B, and C) being given the same set of questions:  "Which part of this picture has a flower on it?" "Which color part of this picture has the same colour as the flower?"  "Which two sides of this picture have identical lines?" There is a picture of four flowers. A student is given one to know all of these words because B's spatial ability is better than his or her cognitive capability.

As shown in the last chapter, it doesn't take very many of us to see that the concept of intelligence requires both spatial and cognitive skills - and not just the one dimension alone.

Now on to math. In this chapter, we will discuss a few of the most common mathematical concepts that are used in daily life. We will also explore a few aspects of real-life mathematics that have important application in everyday life, such as algebraic equations, vector spaces, and random numbers.

In our own personal lives

1. Maths is a very useful tool for communicating with other people. When you think about math, you do the same thing that all people do - you ask questions of other people. Math is not only a very useful tool for communicating with other people but it also allows us to understand many other important concepts that you may not have even imagined!

2. If you look at a lot of math-related discussions that you read about online, you'll find that there is a lot of talk about mathematical problems in a variety of places. It doesn't matter if this discussion is related to school, work, government or even the Internet; mathematical problems keep popping up in a variety of contexts.

3. Maths isn't just a lot of fun; if you are serious about your math studies, math is a great way to develop academic memory, spelling, verbal memory, calculation, and more in a fun and engaging fashion. It's also a great way for individuals learning to communicate with others, show interest in math, and improve reading comprehension.

4. Maths is everywhere: you can find it in everything from the movies to your favorite shows, TV shows, and books. Whether you read a book or watch a TV show, math is used everywhere! Maths is everywhere - whether in libraries, offices, schools, and even at work!  

5. Maths is used to solve a variety of practical problems: such as solving an equation, figuring out the correct solution to a question, etc.

Although most of us aren't familiar with the term "concrete math", we all have had our periods of time when we would spend hours on end solving problems with concrete math rather than solving abstract math solutions.

6. Maths is related to physics – mathematics is actually one of the main disciplines of physics! Physics teaches you how to study and predict the behavior of physical substances.

7. Maths is a way to create images and figures that you use everyday: for example, you might put a lot of color in an image, or you might add a lot of text to your math project. Math can be used to make abstract statements more visual! 

8. Maths is a way to create computer code: the ability to create computer programs can be used throughout the entire

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of Intuition, lets take a look at the following chart. The chart reveals how a person perceives the world in terms of numbers. This number is called Integers, which can be written using a standard set of rules: 1 1 2 3 - and so on until you get to the very end. This set of rules is often known as the Pythagorean Theorem, and is usually thought of as a powerful way to represent and understand concepts like angles, areas, and volumes. However, Intuition is not limited to numbers only; it includes many more subtle ways to think!

The Intuitive person's brain is incredibly sensitive to what their heart is telling them. A person with a strong sense of intuition is often described as "happy" and "super-fit". This is because the type of Intuition the person has is often found in a person with high levels of emotional intelligence - emotional intelligence can be described as being able to navigate through emotion to understand and manage complex situations. In other words, the type of Intuition a person does has a direct effect on how someone is able to handle and predict emotions, feel empathy for others, and handle situations, which in turn, affects how quickly and accurately these types of people understand, interpret, and predict the future.

According to Intuition's theory, people can actually become faster at processing new information, and they can become more accurate in predicting the timing of events and the consequences of their actions - these things are known as Intelligent Personality or Intuition-based Cognitive Behaviors! These two Intuition-based cognitive behaviors are especially interesting as they show our ability as humans to process and utilize concepts differently depending on our type of Intuition.

Now that we have a better understanding of Intuition, and how it relates to people, let's take a look at some of the types of Intuition-based Cognitive Behaviors a person may enjoy!

As mentioned earlier, Intuition can affect our thinking about things as we understand them, predict the results of our actions, and use concepts to predict future outcomes. Intuition can be an excellent teaching tool; a person with a strong sense of intuition is often able to predict what people are feeling and how they will react to certain things and situations ahead of time. Now this type of Intuition-based Cognitive Behaviors can also be good for predicting the outcomes of a person's behavior - this means that people can predict what someone is going to do next and how likely they are to accomplish their next goal! A strong Intuition-based Cognitive Behavior is a sign of a person having strong Emotional Intelligence, and this type of Emotional Understanding can also work well for predicting actions. Remember that Emotion is just an indicator of Intuition-based Cognitive Behavior, not actually a characteristic of a person! So a person with an Intuition-based Cognitive Behavior that is also high in Emotional Intelligence would be a perfect match for a Type-A personality! And a person with an Emotional Intelligence (or a combination of both types) that is also high in Emotion would have a high Emotional Understanding skill - this means that a person could make educated judgments about emotional states, and that they can use this information throughout a person's life!

But of course, this is simply not how Intuition works - unlike mathematics, Intuition doesn't directly model mathematical concepts on physical objects. Instead, Intuition draws on our background knowledge and intuition to make intelligent predictions about various situations. For example, let's say a person has strong Intuition-based Cognitive Behavior about what is dangerous and what is harmless. Then this person would not be able to predict the results of an emergency vehicle collision that happened last year because the person was not able to understand enough of the underlying facts before making a judgment about whether the vehicle was moving in different ways (due to poor knowledge and intuition, the person may not have considered an effect of the speed on the collision) or whether the person could have done something about the collision in order to reduce the danger. Thus, these Intuition-based Cognitive Behaviors are often an important part of learning how to make intelligent predictions!

So In

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the nature of the world we perceive from our own point of view, scientists have investigated the behavior of higher brain centers known as the neocortex. This brain region is where the higher-order mind is formed, and it is one key component for processing information that we perceive. As such, it plays a key role in our ability to understand and interpret the world around us.

The mind is a complex organ, but it is simple enough to visualize. This is because mind and mind are not two separate and separate entities; rather, they are one piece of the same puzzle. According to neuroscience, there are two types of brain centers on the body which are involved in processing our own perceptions:

The frontal cortex is responsible for thinking mathematically; it's like our brain, just differently structured and organized.

The parietal cortex is responsible for making sense of our world. From a cognitive psychology point of view, this is like our brain, but made up of different parts and structures.

What is the role of mathematics within the brain?

The question about the role of mathematics within the brain is a complicated one. There have been a number of claims that suggest that the brain is able to process information, use math, and generate output in order to construct or interpret information. This is in stark contrast to the traditional view of the brain being completely passive and completely ignorant of its surroundings; one that is based on the fundamental understanding of quantum mechanics.

The claim that the brain is able to process math is a mythical one. According to science, our brain can process mathematics based on a number of different theories. One theory is based on modern physics - which suggests that mathematical objects are merely representations of actual objects. In other words, mathematical objects are just mathematical equations that represent how physical objects behave.

Another theory is based on ancient mathematics and physics. The theory suggests that mathematical objects such as equations are not actually mathematical objects at all, but are just tools that people used to describe reality. In other words, the concept of a variable is just the way people can describe things differently.

However these two theories do not completely discount the idea that our brain can perceive and process math.

However, both theories don't completely discount the idea that our brains can process math. In fact, the scientific literature describes a number of facts about what happens when our brains process math using both of these theories.

Mathematically, our brains are able to abstract from the meaning of a number by assigning meaning to words. Thus, it may seem as if the brain's ability to process math is a problem simply because our brains can't effectively use words to describe what they perceive. However, neuroscientists have found evidence that may shed more light on this issue.

In particular, a recent study conducted on animals has found that, in the context of mathematical processes, animals' brains are similar to computer software, in that they are able to create their own programs using math!

The brain seems to be able to create itself and to use math as a coding unit, just like computers! And the question that arises from all of this is whether mathematics is used by humans? As I mentioned earlier, researchers have found evidence that suggests that some of our brains are capable of using math and producing output to understand and describe the world.

While these researchers are not sure of all the details that happen between the abstracted values and outputs, it looks like the brain may be able to generate output to describe and understand the world as a whole - including how a particular math symbol works, what it represents, which symbols are equivalent, and so on.

As such, math may be able to be used as a communication tool instead of simply a means of representation. These types of observations have led researchers to believe that in reality, math may be used in the human brain to generate output in a meaningful way. And since our brains use symbolic representations for all types of computations, this means that we could potentially be able to use mathematical expression to make sense of, and make sense of, phenomena and ideas that we normally can't see or understand from our own perspective.

A third possibility is that the neural basis of arithmetic is used to generate output, even when the process is performed by the brain alone. The process of solving equations using a

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way mathematics interacts with our intellect, we will look at how mental representations can be used to compute and reason based on the laws of physics.

Let's start by going over the idea of mental representations. According to the definition of a mental representation, we mean "the result of a mental process which produces a mental picture". For example, consider a thought from a computer program:
This is a thought; a thought that is represented by a Boolean expression.

Now think about how this thought could be encoded as something like this on a computer's hard ware. A Boolean expression would consist of two parts.

True = 0
False = 1

We can use math to explain both of the parts of the Boolean expression and how they interact. Let's use the Boolean operation AND to explain what we mean:

Or = AND(X,Y)

Or = X AND Y

As you might be able to see, the terms X and Y are the Boolean forms of the two parts of the Boolean expression.

And then, for the AND operation, we can use the following definition:

and: Two Boolean expression parts intersect if and only if they both hold in their true true state, and this is known as a AND. 

But we also need to remember that AND can return negative results, like this:

OR = AND(NOT(X),NOT(Y))

OR = NOT(X AND NOT(Y))...

This means that AND can only indicate if a Boolean expression is true or false, not if it is true or false in a particular way. If AND returns "OR", then both terms X and Y would be TRUE, and neither term would be FALSE - indicating that (X AND Y) would be TRUE.

Now that we have talked about how these two expressions work - Boolean and AND - let's look at how we can combine them to make something more useful. First of all, we can apply Boolean and AND to the two terms that form the Boolean expression. Then we can combine them and create a new Boolean that holds the resultant - now called AND's:

AND(X,Y) = AND(X,Y)OR.

Now, if we had a mental representation - a mental thought - for the AND's we would be able to make a mental representation of it. Let's say that we had a representation of AND(X,Y) as the Boolean expression, AND(X,Y) as a Boolean part, AND(X,Y)  as a Boolean part, AND(X,Y)OR as the Boolean part, AND's(X,Y) as its Boolean part, AND(X,Y)OR as its Boolean part, AND's(X,Y) as his Boolean part - then we would be able to make a Mental Thought:

mentalthought = AND(X,Y)OR,AND(X,Y)OR,AND's(X,Y)OR

Now it's interesting to note that mentalthought can be written as this on a computer's hard ware:

mentalthought = AND(X,Y)OR.

So now we can use Boolean and AND to make a mental representation of a given mental thought - we have the necessary logic to calculate whether the statement we are making is TRUE or FALSE.

Now we can go back to mental representations and figure out how we could apply them to different problem situations and make decisions about them. Imagine you're trying to make a decision based on the truth or falsity of some statement. For example, if you're asking yourself whether or not an ice cube fell from the sky yesterday at night, you could use mental representations as follows:

If ice fell yesterday from the sky at night: false

If ice fell today at night: true

Now all you have to do to make a decision is use the Boolean AND operation to apply mental representations to each of these cases.

Example Problem: Suppose you're considering whether or not someone stole a card from the bank vault late last night.

If somebody stole a card from the bank vault: true

If someone broke into your computer and stole your bank card: false

Suppose that you answered the "is" question "yes", but when you entered your bank account's password you entered an incorrect answer. This means that you are

To better depict how you might apply mathematical concepts to everyday problems, we will use an application which you can use at your own pace. You can explore different types of problems, like adding one to another, multiplying on different sides, and so on. These can be used quite easily, and we will show you some simple examples in more detail in the following chapter.

But that's not all! The best thing about this application is that it connects us to mathematical reasoning and it opens real-world challenges, especially those which relate best to our everyday lives.

Let's look now at a real-life problem that's been used by the United States Army for centuries. Recall that the US Navy Navy SEAL team uses a special "weapons of choice", called sniper rifles that are loaded with very large bullets. To protect their lives and their sniper rifles from being shot upon, the Navy SEAL team only keeps a certain amount of sniper rifles in their arsenal. Now imagine a team of sniper rifles that are deployed into a scenario that's very dangerous: they need to move from a location to an other location, while firing a series of weapons in succession!

On this example, suppose the sniper rifles in the arsenal are deployed into seven different different locations on a map. The locations are numbered in order, or maybe in reverse, starting from the most dangerous location and reaching down until to the simplest locations. The goal of the team is to travel from the most dangerous location to the most peaceful location (situation 7), while firing their sniper rifles at a predetermined rate. Now imagine the Army SEAL team is divided into different groups, each with a different target. So each group has one more location in which they can be hidden. How would you divide the sniper rifles into each of these seven equally, and how would you arrange the groups in order so that the Army SEAL team arrives at their target in the most rapid time possible? It's quite easy - you'll see how simple it is!

Now we will continue our discussion of how to use mathematics to get the job done...!

What about solving problems using mathematics?
Let's say you were to solve a math problem for this team. Let's say we have the following problem:

How many different groups of sniper rifles are there (in this case seven)?
Suppose we're divided in the following groups:
Group #1 = 3
Group #2 = 4
Group #3 = 6
Group #4 = 7

Now suppose we're to distribute these seven groups of sniper rifles evenly between the seven locations. How would we do this? Let's say that our goal is to start from the most dangerous location, moving up the map until we arrive at the most peaceful location, and then move back in reverse until we arrive at our target. We know that we can move up from the most dangerous location to the most peaceful location in O(1) time, so it would be easy to divide them evenly between the locations. Now take the sniper rifles and distribute them evenly between the locations, and move back to the goal location until you reach the target. After travelling through the rest of the locations in O(1) time, it would be trivial to turn back to the most dangerous location to complete this sequence of movements. Now we know that the Army SEAL team needs to travel through O(1) time between target locations since each of the seven locations has to be turned back to one of the other target locations. The total elapsed time between the most dangerous location and the target location is therefore O(1), and by dividing our sniper rifles evenly between the locations, we are guaranteed to reach our target in O(1) time.

Let's examine some examples of using this technique to solve a math problem. Some of these examples are slightly different from the real-life example above, because although the problem in the real-world example requires division of a number of sniper rifles with similar properties, here we're going to have to decide what divisions to use based on the properties of each group of sniper rifles. So for example suppose one of the three groups of sniper rifles in the realistic problem is broken: the sniper bullet will fall in the group of sniper rifles that

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the way in which things work in mathematics, I will define an "istp cognitive function" as some aspect (perhaps a number or an equation) of it that we think we understand, but it's not necessarily what we really do know.

The problem I'm working with in this chapter is that the more you understand mathematics, the less you need to understand everything there is to understand. However, if we do not understand something, it can affect us negatively even if we do understand the rest of mathematics, such as problems that don't give us an answer like

Is there a more efficient algorithm to calculate $AC$ or $AD$ if the equation is unknown?

The answer can be found below...but first let's break things down into categories...

Issues around knowing what you know. Even if we don't know the answer to a question, we still need to learn how to ask a question to solve it. 

Issues around knowing how to use math. What we learn in school is usually very useful...but it's just the "right way" of solving problems. If you're not working in an environment that encourages mathematical thinking, then it will only slow you down. 

Issues around getting the answers. What I mean by this is that when you're working with a problem in the mathematical classroom, there is a chance that you might have to go through the problem a second or two before the answer comes up quickly. In other words, after a second or two, you might think it was fine and continue until you're ready to "run back through" the problem - which is when you just realize you got it wrong. If you're a mathematician, your ability to see the difference between right and wrong is key to succeeding in your studies, as well if you're not just guessing...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the goal of our journey won't be as exciting as some of the stories we have told so far. The group has grown so great together over the last few chapters, but as we face the final days of our journey, there is still uncertainty to be found! After nearly a month of no activity, we're all in need of a new challenge! We'll go to a place where we can leave the group completely, without any knowledge of who we are or what we have done here - or even just being allowed to wander the hallway alone. But we're not quite sure where to go!

Well, let's discuss that!

There's been a lot happening in the last month here - things like the party our newcomers just attended, the group's fight with the evil Darkness, and now our new deity has even come to visit us! So perhaps it's time we had a little fun and set things on a nice, slow-moving pace in order to prepare ourselves for our end!

The first thing to know about this new deity is that it comes equipped with a new power - called the Darkness - that we will use here to control them and control the group that was created when we entered Dimension X. The Darkness has a strange power that allows it to travel among objects at any given moment, and it can cause them to become hostile even though they are in contact with each other. So, to be truly effective against the Darkness, we will need a method to stop it from taking up physical form! Because of that, we are going to need some ways to stop it to keep the group safe and sound!

However, before we can fully prepare ourselves for our end, we need to first figure out how to stop the Darkness! There are several ways that we can stop it - these range from the physically to the energetically. Below we will outline all of the ways we can stop the Darkness!

Weapons

Of course, in order to successfully stop the Darkness, we will need weapons. As our group is still small, we don't have the resources to make a powerful weapon out of wood or stone. However, we have the following weapons that we can use in this battle:

Boots - these boots make sure our feet rest on a more solid foundation, and with an extra load of magic, we can be able to effectively fight against the Dwarfs! It should be noted that the Dwarfs are the only creatures in this entire world that can mount - because of that, their boots won't be needed.
Boots with horns - like the feet of a horse, the horns of our boots allow us to mount on them and fight against other creatures that are unable to do so. It should be noted that even though the horns are mounted over our feet, we still need our boots to keep our feet from sinking into the ground.
Boots with claws - this one is probably the most effective to stop the Darkness from taking physical form, but it's not too obvious!

Chains - this is a good option if you're having trouble stopping the Darkness without the use of weapons. We will attach each of these to our boots so we can chain them together to make them more easily detach from our feet and stop the Darkness from taking form - this is necessary if your boots have a hook, as they're likely to be pulled apart in case one of the feet is pulled out.
Boots with clippers - these are great for removing the claws from the boots and giving us complete freedom. In order to do this, we will need two clippers to take our boots apart, and when they're done, we'll be able to make our boots free to walk again!

Foul - this is the item that we use to control the Dwarfs, as well as to make them completely submissive. For this project, we want to make a couple of spoons, a bowl, and a cup on a table and hand off them to every member of the group after we get the deity control back. However, these are not just for the group! They can be used by anyone that wants to become fearless enough to protect us and the other humans from being attacked by

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the goal of a spiritual life is to achieve inner peace and peace over all life experiences, regardless of their shape. For this reason, it has been proposed (as detailed in Chapter Eight of the Book of the Five Principles) that each personality type be specified by a number of key characteristics such as creativity, intelligence, motivation, persistence, compassion, and integrity. These characteristics are called the four M personality types!

For the purpose of this chapter, we will be restricting our attention only to the MBTI model of Personality. I will briefly touch on the three types of the MBTI model in the next section. For now, let's focus on the four M types!

The fourth major personality type on the MBTI personality inventory is M. At first glance, it appears that this type may not be useful for spiritual pursuit as it does not provide much insight into spiritual motivation. However, this is not true at all. M is a character that can be quite unique, as evidenced by certain events in the life of its subject. For example, one M subject might become obsessed with a certain aspect of the spiritual world, like a painting of Buddha - or he might try to make a statement about his own religiosity without actually considering whether or not his beliefs are true to reality. At another extreme, one M subject might be unconcerned at all about religion and believe it was simply a fad that people indulged in to get rid of some of the boredom of everyday life. Of course when we begin to take note of the many unique aspects of every personality, we realize that M is actually the least unique type and, with the exception of the Creative/Ability and Persistence sub-types, the best type to describe our own personal nature. However, this does not change our overall intent and objectives at all, because we have a reason to study and understand this personality type!

So what is M? Well...it turns out M is the name of one of the MBTI's sub-types - M-ABP - Agreeableness/Balance/Passion: Agreeableness is not that different than agreeableness on the MBTI (and for people, both agreeableness and agreeableness can be high at times.) The only difference is that the Agreeableness sub-type might have a tendency to feel a little more sensitive to others than those same people would actually feel - a tendency that is reflected in the other types of MBTI sub-types - Openness to experience, Novelty Seeking, and Sensuality. As far as Balance goes, M has more of it - balance in our inner lives can be difficult to attain if we aren't careful. Also, M is an indicator for our ability to perceive and interpret the needs, desires, and feelings of others. It does this by giving us the ability to connect "consciously" with another person. We will also need to consider the Passion sub-type, because M is also associated with a sense of enthusiasm.

M-ABP can be understood as three distinct mental elements that interact to create a person. These elements are:

 Agreeableness

 M-ABP is related to aspects of the way in which we are empathetic and sympathetic. It can be influenced by external circumstances that make us feel that we are being understood.
 Balance

 This is related to our ability to accept or experience life's nuances and to be aware that things are never the way they seem (though sometimes we do take things for granted).
 Passion

 This feature is primarily tied to our level of "emotion". At its worst, we could be totally emotionless. Or we might react overly strongly to situations, or we could use too much force.

As with many other MBTI type descriptors, there are several ways it can be measured, and it is the subject's perception of these attributes that helps determine which type the person falls in (a combination of these three sub-types is what gives a clear indication of personality type in the MBTI). M-ABP is one example of a way how our perceptual abilities can be measured, and other dimensions like Openness to experience and Novelty Seeking can be seen

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the effects of marriage on the lives of both men and women, we will utilize the metaphor of bakery. In this way, we can explain the effect of marriage on other aspects of life both here and in the future! This could be an effective introduction to several more concepts...but let's not get too ahead of ourselves!

We know there are three major types of relationships: romantic, sexual, and spousal. Each of these would typically last for a lifetime or lifetime and span many different stages during its lifetime (e.g. relationship initiation, love, marriage, and eventually divorce). In addition, each relationship would typically involve a large amount of both love and responsibility. However, these basic types of relationships are not necessarily the only options available to humans. In a more detailed sense, there are nine different types of human relationships that we will explore in this chapter.

Let's begin by looking at the nature of romantic relationships and the impact of these relationships on the lives of a spouse and his or her spouse. First, though, let's review a few more important concepts!

Romantic relationships are basically defined as "one's willingness to share the love of another person with complete and unconditional devotion."  In other words, when we desire someone to care for, love, and cherish us, we are in a romantic relationship. Let's take a look at an example of a romantic relationship...

The marriage is the union between two people.  A marriage is a binding contract between two people that establishes a foundation for the couple, and provides for basic legal and living security to the couple.  A marriage may be civil or religious, with no legal consequence in either case.

To illustrate the idea of marriage, let's consider a marriage between John and Mary.  Both people would have to give legal signatures at an event titled "Marriage", which would be held right here in the present day. In the event, John would be asked to sign the papers as a witness, while Mary would also be required to sign - so it's important to remember that these documents would have to be witnessed by everyone from both people, and would need to be witnessed by more than two people, before the ceremony finally comes to a close. After all of this is done, the couple would then be ready to go live happily ever after...which is pretty much exactly what happens in today's practice!

Let's now take a look at a similar situation in a couple's lives who are "blind" - meaning they did not receive the instruction to learn the skills necessary to become legally competent to drive cars. In this way, the couple was actually given the opportunity to live happily ever after, but instead of being legally able to travel and live in their own home, they simply had to continue to wait - in other words, until they were given the opportunity to learn driving skills that would enable them to legally drive. This is the basis of civil engineering and civil engineering is the practice in which we can create buildings and infrastructure to support people and their needs, including buildings and infrastructure for vehicles.

So if someone was born blind, and they could legally drive a car, would they still be legally able to live happily ever after? Clearly, these two situations are not the same! In other words, the fact that a person can legally drive a car doesn't necessarily mean that he or she will be happily ever after in a marriage! This is especially true for blind people - if they were allowed to become legally competent to walk, then they would certainly be happy to find a way to live with other people, but if they were allowed to become legally competent to drive a car, then they would no longer be legally happy with their marriage.

Next, let's come to sexual relationships. As much as we try to hide our sexual inclinations, it's still very possible for our partners to show evidence of their interest, although it is more likely they will hide it from us, so let's ignore it for a moment. 

In fact, sexual relationships are generally seen in a negative light from most people, so let's briefly recap some basic facts regarding our sexual relationships and the impact of these relationships on our lives.  A sexual relationship is basically defined as "one person engaging in sexual expression or sexual thoughts..."  Now

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the differences between the different dimensions of space-time, physicists often refer to them with the symbols 'd', 'c', 'w', and 'h'. These symbols will be used throughout the rest of the chapter to better convey to the reader the basic physics behind the concepts of these dimensions. As I mentioned in my last chapter, there are an infinite number of spacetime dimensions. For our purposes we will consider only three of them - the 2 spatial dimensions and the 1 time dimension. We refer to these three dimensions as Dimensions 1, 2, and 3. Since a particle can move through these three physical dimensions at the same time, it is reasonable to divide the entire history of physics between these three dimensions - the past, present, and future respectively.

The origins of these three different physical dimensions were a long long time ago. According to the Maya, these would be three different forms of reality that they were trying to communicate with one another. The first of these forms of reality called maya would be the realm of the living. It was also believed by the Maya that the lives of the dead may be preserved on the living world. The second form of reality was called the abyss of maya, and the third form known as the world of light was believed to be the physical world itself. Each of these different worlds contained all kinds of beings that were believed to work together to communicate. It was believed that these different worlds were connected through time, which meant that time could pass from one world to another through another. These different worlds were not separated by space, but rather by time.

According to the Maya, these beings interacted every day throughout this universe. This communication was done in language. As long as the message was true, it could be read without a doubt - so it was the only thing necessary to know about a person or event. It was even believed that these different beings spoke the same language - the Maya called it the Maya language.

If these beings could communicate with each other at such a high level, then how can we not understand them? Well, in their own words, we don't! Well...maybe we could!

We had just learned that the Maya believed that they all believed the same message - that is to say, that they believed that the Maya language was the only message that could communicate with the other beings! So did the other beings? They were certainly trying to communicate as well - they did try, but was it true that they could communicate with the Maya?

To try to figure out what the others believed, they sent out invitations to each other. If they accepted the invitations, then they were meant to believe that they would be receiving the messages from each other that they had sent out. If they didn't, then it meant that they were either lying or, worse, had hidden their truths from each other. One of the reasons that the Maya were lying was that these beings knew that they could control every single thing that happened in this universe; it was called the Maya knowledge.

These beings sent out invitations for communication until the time arrived when each of them had the correct information to communicate with the others. As soon as they received this information, the other beings would either send out another invitation to the next person or, according to certain circumstances, the invitations would pass from the initiator to the recipient without any communication happening. As long as no communication happened because the message had been false, the initiator would still be able to believe the invitations.

I will now leave this story for the reader to imagine...and to see for themselves where the story was going!

Three Dimensions
This time I'm going to teach you how to use the three dimensions of space. This concept may not make much sense to you straight away - you may be wondering how a piece of cake is made into an apple! Well, just think about why - a cube of cake is not a round apple; it is just a piece of cake - which doesn't make a significant difference since the cube and apple are still just cubes!

The shape of a cube may make some people think that it is impossible for a piece of cake to become an apple; however, this is just the wrong way to think! If we consider just

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict the concept of micéliobility that we have been exploring throughout history, we can talk about how the world looked 10,000 years ago. Now this will require us to discuss how the structure of the universe changed during this period, the influence of technology, and the rise of civilization.

In the past few thousand years, the space-time that we experience on Earth has completely changed. All the planets were in constant motion and surrounded each other by a huge void that contained the oceans of both water and oil. As the oceans spread throughout this void, the earth appeared to become larger and more spherical, forming a huge globe known as the Earth.

The oceans were in constant motion and surrounded each other by a huge void that contained both water and oil

One of the most significant changes occurred around 10,000 years ago. As the oceans spread throughout this void, the earth appeared to become smaller (and more spherical) - which caused it to lose all of it's oxygen content and begin to burn the earth's atmosphere. Since no oxygen is produced on the surface, the atmosphere was eventually stripped away and the sun no longer appeared. The sun began to fade away...for a while.

The sky began to fade away
This was the last stage of this entire process; the sun no longer appeared!

As the sun began to fade away, the night would begin and the dead would rise. Some of these dead would rise to higher latitudes to sleep, while others would migrate south into the desert from a more humid climate. As this dust was moved south, it would travel into Mexico and Central America, then east to the United Kingdom and South Africa, ultimately ending up in the Atlantic. At some point, this dust would reach the equator and form an enormous desert called the Sahara. Over the next 5,000 years, this dust would travel through Europe and eventually end up in Northern Africa - where it would eventually form the Sahara.

The Sahara continues to exist

The Sahara was initially known as the Sahara Desert because it had a specific shape, it wasn't a desert - that shape was caused by the dust coming from the Sahara. It was only later that scientists found out that the Sahara had a distinct shape because of ancient human remains. Because of its complex shape, some of the Sahara was believed to have been caused by dinosaurs, while others were believed to have been due to humans. As the Sahara became increasingly covered with dust from the Sahara's migration through time, humans began to move towards higher latitudes. Eventually, the Sahara ended up covering almost half of North America and the Atlantic Ocean.

North America, Europe, and Atlantic Ocean now cover nearly half of the world

As we continue to look at more information about the origin of civilization, we will look more closely at the fact that it began after the death of the dinosaurs was an event that took place almost 20 million years ago. Humans were thought to have spread out across the planet from a smaller gathering of about 200,000 people, but then evolved as an even larger, possibly millions of times larger, gathering over the next 200,000 years. This spread extended across North America, Europe, and the Atlantic Ocean, but in reality, only a tiny fraction of these nations - North America, Europe, and the Atlantic Ocean - remained to enjoy a higher standard of social health and happiness during the 21st century!

The spread of human civilization did continue across the globe for approximately 500 years
As civilization extended across the globe, the majority of the world remained sparsely populated, yet it was still the world of the dinosaurs! This was due to the fact that most of the world was situated in one or two large areas. This spread began when humans began to move across the globe, and eventually spread as they spread to other lands. Since most of these nations were isolated and isolated from one another, they didn't easily become part of the global economy...until their population grew sufficiently large to make themselves part of the global economy!

Human population rose in the 21st century

As civilization grew, so did the rate at which it sped up its expansion! This occurred when society began to rely heavily on farming to supply its people with needed food. As it expanded further, it also grew exponentially larger. This massive population had the ability

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the universe is composed of a single element called "energy" - everything that exists in the universe is made up of energy. It is an energy which can be created, created but cannot be destroyed, so it is the source of all forces. This energy has a very particular shape - it has an almost infinite number of forms, each with a shape and properties that it is best expressed in terms of one-dimensional curves. It is this way of describing everything that makes black hole theory interesting and difficult to understand....

The Black Hole

One of the basic tenets of black hole theory is that matter and energy have different shapes and their interactions with each other result in a strong gravitational field. It is this form of interaction that explains black hole formation!

The Black Hole and Its Bond

Black hole formation requires a strong gravitational field which acts as a potential barrier to anything that is sufficiently massive. Even though this potential barrier is infinite, it is very low compared to the pressure of the surrounding vacuum! As we said earlier, everything we perceive is based on its own energy - the energy density or energy per unit volume is inversely proportional to mass. Since this energy density is low, we are bombarded by gravitational waves that create this high pressure in the surrounding vacuum.
The gravitational field also creates an enormous force that pulls things towards the center of the black hole. As we mentioned earlier, the pressure here is much higher than the surrounding vacuum, which results in this immense central force pushing objects towards the center of this black hole! This is why black holes appear as a single "blob" when you try to squeeze things very tightly! The very strong forces that act on objects inside a black hole are a reason why we don't perceive it as a single "blob" - we all have to deal with that internal explosion of energy as we can!

As a side note, the black hole has its own name - the "Black Hole". This name is used to distinguish it completely from the much smaller "Event Horizon" which you see when something tries to exit black holes! Event Horizon as used by scientists is a type of "dark energy" that is present in theories that link black holes to dark energy! Since it is a form of energy density, it is called "dark energy", whereas what we perceive is called "black hole energy"! This is exactly why you see events happen in both of these spaces, since both events happen in both dimensions! And as we mentioned earlier, events don't make the entire universe appear as a single "blob" - they just cause objects to move from one place to another when their internal energy is being created! We perceive both "Event Horizon" and "Black Hole" at the same time when we try to squeeze them together - both can create and absorb energy, but the internal events make the two separate!

Another way to think about it is this. As a matter of fact, you don't always only see black holes! There are so many other black holes that exist in space, but they are not visible due to the extreme low pressure or the dense mass of their center. They are actually known as "Event Horizon", because they are created by gravitational waves that are created when we try to make a hole in a solid object that is composed of energy!

Since black holes are formed due to gravitational interactions, they must be of some sort of "energy". They also exist outside of the universe but their "energy" is very much different from the "energy" of the black holes. They are "energy" that creates the space-time curvature and the strong gravitational field that results in black hole formation, but they are not "energy" that can create anything! They can only absorb and transform things - they can use their own energy to create anything; thus, it makes them completely different from "black hole" energy as we understand it.

The Cosmological Constant

Another theory that ties black holes and dark energy is called Cosmology. It is a theory by Carl Sagan's author that states that the universe consists of a tiny percentage of some type of energy or "energy source" that is believed to be very powerful! This theory is also known as the "cosmic principle", and Sagan has

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the laws of physics determine how objects move and how to behave under various circumstances. However, in addition to these laws, there are concepts like time dilation and relativity that allow us to learn much more about the behaviour and behaviour of particles that travel through different dimensions and time.

While we have focused on the concepts of time dilation and relativity so far, it's important to note that certain forms of recreational drugs - specifically methamphetamine - are known to move objects through different spatial and temporal dimensions.
Let's examine some of the most notable uses for the concept of recreational drugs. Methamphetamine is an ephedrine type of substance that is found in some people who use recreational drugs. This substance is a major cause of amphetamine type of substance abuse worldwide as it gives users a heady experience through an increase in dopamine levels in the brain.

As detailed in Chapter Twenty Four, dopamine is an important component in brain function, and it is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for reward and reinforcement. Dopamine is a chemical in the body that transmits messages between different parts of the brain. Dopamine is a major element in motivation, and it is the most important component of reward processes in the brain - it controls the degree to which people seek and experience pleasure, as well as the drive or desire to experience something - like taking a drink from a vending machine!

In short, taking a drink from a vending machine is often the only choice that makes sense for a person - that person might not know about the benefits and risks of taking that drink, but they are going to "feel" like they are on their way to being "homeless", and therefore will probably choose to take a drink in a vending machine rather than going to work...even if the job is physically dangerous!

At first glance this seems a pretty amazing concept that allows us to use the reward and pleasure brought by a drink, but this is not so - this is just one example of how we could use the notion of "'reward and pleasure'" to explain how people use psychoactive substances to gain power and dominance in other people!

Unfortunately, although there are some great and powerful consequences being brought by the use of recreational drugs, in reality there are far more horrific consequences also. As you become addicted to recreational drugs, you begin to experience a massive increase in your cognitive, emotional, biological, and cognitive brain functions. Because of this, your body begins to undergo significant changes to its metabolism, creating a number of toxic substances to get rid of these unwanted chemicals from the body.

Some of these toxic substances end up building up in your bloodstream, and if these can go unchecked, then they'll have a major impact on the brain and other important organs in the body. This makes it all the more critical that as an individual we keep our body constantly under an extremely regulated state of mind - since the brain is where our thoughts and actions are going to be - we need to constantly be looking out for the best and worst to ensure that we don't end up in a much more toxic situation than we have right now! But this is not hard to do - we just need to look around our own home and make sure that we are keeping our emotions under control at all times while we're doing the dishes.

To be perfectly honest, I find myself constantly thinking about how easy it would be to simply stop using such drugs - but at this point, I can't even imagine that people of any actual worth would ever decide to stop taking these medications to begin with, let alone be aware of the huge effects it will have on us. However, this would lead me to believe that if some people became addicted to recreational drugs, then it would not take long for them to realize that there are far worse consequences than simply having a high, or even using drugs recreationally.

In other words, if recreational drugs were able to make us feel more "homeless" as compared to normalcy, it might end up making us feel like we were in a better place than we are right now - however, at this point these drugs are starting to cause us far worse consequences than ever imagined!...

So let's take

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the world of the High Priest Húrin, what better way to model this world than by using one of the many different factions that run the country? 
As described in last week's chapter, there are eight factions in Húrin: the king, the king's son, the priests, the sorcerers, the minstrels, the magicians, the elves, and the wizards. These groups each have a unique set of skills as well as their own goals and desires as they try to run the country.

As we discussed before, humans live in a country that is governed by a king. Within this country there are several kingdoms - many within each of which certain titles (such as the Lord of Thee, The King's Lord, etc) do not change. Additionally, there are many private individuals, or rulers, residing within these kingdoms, as well as the general population of people of all ages and strata.

The Lord of Thane

In order to run a kingdom, you need to fill a role. The Lord of Thane is normally the head of a faction, but he can also serve as someone in command. For example, a Lord of Thane could serve as the Head of the Kingdom's Secret Service, the Head of the House of the Priest, the Secretary General of The Searcher, or the Prime Minister.
The Lord of Thane is the highest civilian official within a kingdom. For many years, many of the most prominent members of the country would come to The Lord of Thane to present their ideas, policies and plans. The Lord of Thee would then make the final decision and pass along his orders via a seal to the other officials and members of the parliament.

The King

The king of Húrin is the highest government official in the entire country, and he can fill any number of titles depending on the kingdom he is in. Some of the titles that were previously awarded to the king include The Lord of Thane, The King of Húrin, and The Royal Lord of Húrin. In addition to acting as the highest government official in his kingdom, the king is also responsible for running many of the other governmental agencies that are important to his kingdom.
The king is also the highest patron of the king's family, but there is not much to be said for them as their royal position is almost entirely dependent on the king.

The King of Húrin

The King of Húrin is considered the highest level citizen of Húrin. He is considered one of the greatest heroes of Húrin, and he is the symbol of the kingship. His title is The Royal King's Lord, which means he is the only individual at Húrin to be regarded as the highest citizen, despite Húrin being very much a people in itself...

The King of the Sea

In order to run his kingdom, the king of the sea needs to fill a role. He is a member of the royal navy, and for many years he commanded the royal navy. However, due to the loss of most of his fleet during the battle of Dúrin, he was not awarded the title of the King of the Sea for a while. In order to fill this role, the king of the sea has to be a member of the royal navy, and he must possess some level of military experience. He usually serves as the Commander-in-Chief, while his subordinates serve as the Senior Officers.

Secretary-General of the Searcher

The Secretary General of the Searcher is responsible for running the Searcher's Office - which is an important part of the government. The secretary-general of this office is the head of the Searcher's Council, which has seven members and has all the powers of the Office. The Secretary General is also charged with overseeing and managing the finances of the Searcher's Palace, and he also acts as the Head of The Searcher's Council.

Secretary-General of the Ministry

The Secretary General of The Ministry is one of the most senior officials within the Ministry of Húrin. He is usually responsible for overseeing the policies of the ministry regarding the entire nation. In addition

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the problem, let's do a visual example using some of the programming languages used in today's web sites - which we call the "Web Languages". These languages don't just exist to build websites - they are actually quite good in the real world. Websites can be thought of as web pages that hold information in different languages - the more languages they use, the greater the functionality they can offer.

Now on our own computer, we can access our websites using different web browsers - the three main ones being Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. Unfortunately, the three browsers don't all work the same way. Let's make a quick comparison using an example that exists in one of our web browsers - it's called Firefox. Let's say we wanted to install software called firefox-python on our system. Well in order to do this, we would need to install the Python bindings - the language that allows the Python interpreter to work in other programs. Let's say this was performed by one of these programs called a "bash shell" - the bash shell is a program used in Unix-like operating systems to do some basic shell code. What is it doing? Well it is calling a script called python that takes as its input a full line of text in the shell's console, translates the shell's console into Python, and then executes another shell script called python-3.6.3.exe.

Let's say we were given the following commands:
#!/usr/bin/python
import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))

#! /usr/bin/python
for item in ['foo','bar']
: print(item)

#! /usr/bin/python
for item in ['baz','blubbs','blubble']
: print(item)

Now let's assume that the following two code snippets are in our web browser:
>>> #! /usr/bin/python
import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))
>>> #! /usr/bin/python
for item in ['foo','bar']

The line on the left is printed in an HTML browser, while the line on the right appears in a text editor, which in turn shows the result in a window displaying information about the input. In both cases, everything is the same - in both instances the output is a variable, of type string, with the same contents (random.randint(1, 10)). This is obviously because Python calls the string module to convert the variable into a string, and then copies the string into a new variable called item.

When we want to access our web pages from another computer, we now need to install all of the necessary libraries, which in turn require some additional shell code - like these:
#! /usr/bin/python
import subprocess
import fileinput
import socket
try:
    # Python < 2.3 only
    subprocess.call('node -v')
finally:
    if subprocess.Popen(['node -t', 'nodestatus', '-n', '/Users/me/nomine/databasename.db']):
        print('\nRunning Node')
        sleep(0.1)
subprocess.call('ps auxww | grep node -V')
subprocess.call('tail -n50 ~/Desktop/Nomine.desktop')
subprocess.call('sudo cp ~/Desktop/Nomine.desktop /Users/nomine/Desktop/Nomine.desktop')
subprocess.call('systemctl stop nopython.service')
return
try:
    fh = file('/tmp/nodem', 'r')
    data = fh.read().decode('utf-8')
except UnicodeDecodeError:
    data = 'Text converted to UTF-8'
#! /usr/bin/python
for data in data:
    print(data)

From here, it is quite easy to see that both the Python script to download the Python bindings and the Python interpreter from the Internet can be executed - but only under certain circumstances. This is why some of the most popular web browsers are using the Web Workers framework! This is explained in more detail in the next chapter!

We have finally reached the topic of functionality in web pages. In the upcoming chapters, we'll study how web pages interact

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the power and influence of magic, people tend to associate this form of creation and art with the use of magic. Many believe that the most powerful and mysterious arts of creation are the work of the magicians! However, the truth about magic as we usually associate it is quite far from it. There are many aspects of magic that come from and are not related in any way to the use of magic! In this chapter we will discuss three major ways in which magic can be used to create worlds...for example, to create the material world that happens to exist in this universe! It is very important to realize that there are other ways of creating worlds, such as using magic to create dimensions, or by simply using other forms of creativity. So let's look at how magic is used to create the space-time we experience in everyday life.

The first thing you need to understand about magicians is this...there are very many different kinds of magicians! The best way to understand the diversity of different forms of magical creation is to learn about the three different styles of magic. You will see that magicians typically use many of the same tools and techniques as they use magicians to create magical worlds from their imagination. So in this chapter we will cover 3 different methods of creating worlds by using magic!

First, we will discuss the world building technique called the "art of creation". Art of Creation magic is incredibly popular all over the world, as it offers a very different approach to creating the universe...by simply focusing on the material world that exists in this universe without having to think to create the universe from scratch. And the best part...the art of creation magicians have never "created" anything! They're simply making a mockup of what the material world should look like by using the concepts and imagination of the magicians that created the material world! So to better understand this process, let's go into detail...

As we saw in Part One of this series, magic plays a large role in creating the world we experience in our everyday lives. And to truly understand the power of magic, you need to understand what magic actually is! Just like many other forms of creation, magic was created from the combination of concepts and creativity. The difference between magic and magical art stems from the fact that magicians themselves are non-existent, so the concept and imagination in creating magical art comes from the imagination of the magicians themselves. Magic can thus be understood as a combination of concepts and imagination, but it differs from magical art since Magic relies on the power of the imagination; magical art involves real-world entities.

Since magical art relies on imagination, it is quite difficult to create something that is entirely created by people who aren't even aware of being magical. As we have seen in last chapter, that is why magic is usually associated with magic makers like the wizard, a magical artist, or even the magician himself. If you were to visit a magic show in a theatre, you would probably see that the magician was always wearing a mask (or perhaps a cloth) - people often look for reasons behind the mask of someone performing magic. And while there are a number of "actual" versions of the magician, we are not going to cover each of them in this section! Instead, lets focus on the role of the magician in reality (as used in magic shows, and magicians themselves)

Magic is really just a metaphor for creating the actual reality that exists inside of us. In Part One, we discussed how the mind works, and how it creates reality. In Part Two, we focused on the material world that exists in the world that we live in. In this chapter we will focus on the world building process that takes place in the imagination of the magician (or sometimes, the magician himself).

As I mentioned in Part One, the mind is a process that creates reality, but there is also a third process that is often used when creating reality. This third process is called creativity! Now, creativity isn't hard to understand, simply because everyone has some talent for creating things, regardless of whether they are real or not. And when we look at history, we're likely to see many people who were creative and artistic, while not being able to do anything

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the concept of dimension, let's imagine we were traveling through the meadow in the book The Meadow Maga by William F. Burroughs. Imagine we were following a path that gradually opened in front of us; it's clearly visible as we're traveling out in the open. Let's also assume our path is in free fall from here, thus it is going to always be moving forward in straight lines.

Now let's get back to our original question, in the book The Meadow Maga we see a man named George who is a wandering mage. However, for the most part, even George is traveling as if he were walking slowly. Not only has he never been in a magical place before, but he doesn't use magic either. Just like every human being, he is living a normal, everyday ordinary life.

Now let's consider George's experience in the book rather than his actual experience - if we were following a path like that, then why would he walk slowly? Would he use magic? Or would he simply sit quietly and enjoy the view?

Because he's a wandering mage! A wandering magician can not only travel between different dimensions to find other magical locations, but they can also travel as part of an actual magical journey into other dimensions.

This concept of wandering mages is what we get to explore a bit more in-depth in this lesson. We'll use it to explore how wandering mages can move through other dimensions, and we will also look at how that allows them to communicate between the planes while still staying in this particular dimension!

First of all, before we get into this story, let's first explore the concept of wandering mages, so we'll know what we're talking about better.

A wandering mage, also called a wandering monk can travel between different dimensions, sometimes without ever exiting a specific dimension. A wandering mage is a type of person who is not tied down by a birth or family or religion. Like most people of a certain age, they have developed strong faith that has helped them through many different trials and tribulations. Their personal philosophy is that they believe that they are walking back in time to the moment they were born, and that when they find their personal spirit inside them, then they can go into other dimensions.

By wandering monks, we generally mean anyone that follows a wandering path like that of George the wandering mage here. A wandering warrior, as is usually the case, is someone who follows a more direct way of living; they're usually not religious so as such, they may be less religious. However, a wandering warrior can follow the same lines that the wandering path we are discussing above, and these lines can lead them to other dimensions.

So let's examine this wandering warrior...George! Imagine we're following a path like that and George is wandering back in time to the moment he was born. 
What happens to George's personal spirit as he wanders back in time? Well there are certain things he feels that are present when he was born. We also have a certain amount of magical strength - one of the reasons he's a wandering monk. What type of strength do the people he meets during these wandering journeys gain from this?

According to George, he would be able to gain new powers and abilities of his own, but this is by no means guaranteed. George is aware of the fact that the powers and abilities that he gained from these wandering experiences are still going to play a big part in his life - like a wandering blade or sword, will always need sharpening and refining in order to be used effectively. What does that mean? Well it's quite similar to what the wandering warrior is able to gain from these same experiences. 

Because these wandering mages use the same methods of communication as humans - the same language that most people are comfortable with - they are able to communicate without ever needing to use a magical weapon. These wandering mages are also able to talk directly to each other without the need for any magical weapons to communicate.

We all want to talk and talk and talk without taking ourselves too seriously - that is a good thing. However, what does all this really mean to us? Well to answer that question

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the concept of dimensionality is only a part of understanding the strange behavior of many different objects, most notably our bodies. Our bodies are made entirely of matter; however, this does not make matter a completely inert system - and, unfortunately, it doesn't stop matter from traveling through time.
However, what this means is that matter is not stationary and is capable of traveling through time. The universe is vast and incredibly complex and, in spite of our efforts, we have only a fraction of it to our own advantage. That is, the majority of the universe lies on our own surface, and our bodies are only the tip of the iceberg that we can reach before further exploration and discovery begins! There are just a few other species of life that inhabit the outside of the Earth that have not been seen by us yet (a large portion of the solar system being the exception to this rule, though!).

Before we explore this further, we need to understand the concept of dimensionality a little more thoroughly. Generally speaking, there are three basic dimensions:
Einstein's theory of relativity suggested (at times) there were five or even six dimensions; however, this theory was disproven in 1979 by Albert Einstein himself!

Let us take dimension X as an example. It is said that there are a total of 16 possible ways in which the dimension X could be present in a particular space-time environment - the 4D space-time described by all of the axes: x, y, z, and t. It could exist as a 3D space, a 4D cube, a 2D cube, and even a 6D cube! Let's call this 6D cube.

What could potentially happen to a 6D cube? Well, since it's a six-dimensional cube, it could have any one of the 16 possible configurations. It could be rotated, flattened, and other forms...and of course it could still remain a cube, which would still result in a 6D cube.

So what if we rotate a 6D cube around its z-axis? What if the z-axis was rotated by 0.01 radians per second? Well, let's see what happens - imagine that our 6D cube has the same dimensions as a normal hexagonal prism (a cube whose sides are all the same) but has its z-axis rotated by 0.01 radians per second at every second. Note that this isn't a great way to see what's happening, but since it is the same cube with different dimensions, this should still give us the same picture! Imagine your 6D cube now being placed under a magnet - and observe what happens! The directions of the axes of the cube shift to follow the directions of the rotating field - but the axis between the two magnet poles (which is the z-axis) doesn't start to follow the rotating field, and therefore it remains static! This leads us to the other crucial point!

As we alluded to above, matter is not stationary - it can travel through spacetime. And as we now know, there are a variety of possibilities for objects moving through a given dimension: from 3D planes and cubicles to 5D cubes and hexagons...

And finally, let's take a closer look at what happens to certain bodies when traveling through multiple dimensions. Let us take a look at the way things stand today with Earth!

We now know that there are three basic dimensions, as you can see from the chart above. Our Earth is composed of seven principal bodies - the Moon, the Mars, the moon's moons, Pluto and Mercury, and Neptune. The Moon, Pluto, Mars, and Mercury can all move through Dimension X, but only Mercury and the Moon can move through Dimension Z! The rest of the planets (except Mars and Mercury) live just outside of Dimension X.

How would this effect the behaviour of Earth in Dimension X? And now let us get into a more in-depth discussion of how planets travel through Dimension X. The three principal bodies of the Earth (Moon, Mars, and Mercury) all live in the outer regions of Dimension X, making most of Earth's surface - just outside of the Moon and Mercury. Although this means they can be hit by other planets, it still means that their effects on the Earth are very small
