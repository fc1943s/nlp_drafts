 So, deity do move with the same speed as our own 3-D spacetimes, and can also travel backwards without time-lapses whatsoever.

So, while it may still take several years to figure out completely how to navigate around this big 4-D universe in order to explore the various universes that exist, with little to no trouble...it's definitely possible!  We're just waiting for the next galactic revolution.

EDIT: This question was somewhat vague enough that I decided to rewrite it somewhat. In essence, I was asking, "How much can you travel before getting trapped inside your own dimensional portal, or your time-dilated dimensional travelers will turn out to be trapped in their own dimension". I think that question should better fit within this category, though!
