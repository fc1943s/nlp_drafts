 In other words, deities are incredibly powerful entities that can enter into various dimensions without much of an impact or disturbance!

A:

As a general rule, the only way that things can "sink" higher than their lower dimensional counterpart is a gravitational effect; a force, acting on smaller masses, will tend to push or sink them down. That is a general principle, known as the Principle of Maximum Gravitational Force and which states that gravity has a tendency to push objects downward. For example, if two particles sink down due to gravity, it will tend to keep them lower than if one of them were only the force of gravity acting upon a free falling object. It can be shown that this is analogous to gravitational contraction. The Principle of Maximum Mass (with a variable mass), states that objects become lower and lower as their mass becomes smaller. (It's possible that the Principle of Maximum Mass and the Principle of Maximum Force can be combined, leading to an object being the combined gravitational force of two smaller masses.) These principles can be derived using Newton's second law and a general coordinate rotation, such as the Euler or Lagrange ones described above. (They can be simplified further when the variables are related to each other, such as in the Principle of Maximum Mass for a fixed mass - and then used to predict motion of smaller masses, as described in the Principle of Maximum Gravitational Force.)
