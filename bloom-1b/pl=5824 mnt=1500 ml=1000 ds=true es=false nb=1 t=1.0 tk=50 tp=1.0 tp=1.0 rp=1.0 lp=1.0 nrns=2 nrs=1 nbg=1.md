Yes, ultimately, the entire universe is not a one-dimensional chain of 4-dimensional buildings! Instead, throughout the universe there exists a vast array of building blocks known as buildings, each of which has its native four dimensions.
All buildings have four "inner" dimensions:
Dimension 1  -- The "length" dimension.
Dimension 2 -- "The width" or "shape" (or, often, either)
Dimension 3 -- "Timing" or "The age"
Dimensionality -- number or number combination of these four different length, width, age and timing dimensions in which the building exists (one dimension can have more than one dimension, depending on the nature and circumstances of its creation). For example, one wall constructed in Dimension 1 could be called a "wall of one" and two walls of Dimension 2 could each be said to be "walks of two"!

To use the term "walk" for a building, of course! This definition goes a long way to explain why it has four inner dimensions! The building could have any shape or size, ranging from simple and simple geometrical shapes to large and sometimes exotic creatures. It could also run over and over again, repeating the same patterns many and many times until it reaches equilibrium! Sometimes it even reaches out and touches dimensions beyond its boundaries! There is no such thing as a fixed and static building...

As we look back through our history, we'll find that from the very beginning of life we have seen buildings of an infinitesimal length as well as large complex objects. Not all dimensions are important - for example dimensions 1 and 2 are of little interest to anyone who actually lives in three-dimensional space. On the other hand, many of our objects, in their more traditional incarnations, have dimensions ranging over several different kinds of length (i.e. walls which span multiple "layers") to width (we'll talk about that in Chapter 39) and depth (walls can span the three dimensions of height, depth, thickness). Let's take these examples a few more closely.

One example of how people have constructed buildings over the history of times is the Babylonian ziggurats. These were large, complex monolithic structures containing hundreds of rooms all enclosed by vast moats of wall and floor construction. One of their most iconic features was their ceiling, an elaborate and sophisticated architectural feat topped with a circular dome, or dome. A great deal of information is still written about these structures, detailing their architecture, their function and much more!

Another famous example is found in modern day architecture from ancient times: The Chinese Tower of Weibing (also called the Red Dragon Tower, as opposed to Dragon's Head Tower)!

These four major building dimensions range on all sides, with different numbers of them. Each dimension contains information that helps us to comprehend the construction, function, importance and evolution of buildings. 

By studying these building examples, students will gain a thorough understanding of what's going on in space, how things appear in various dimensions (including dimensions other than these), why there should be, what the laws are that governing the movement and behavior and also how our bodies can physically interact with these buildings!

For a deeper understanding from other perspectives, consider watching TV shows like "Buildings", "How the world works today"

A:

The biggest issue that has to do with understanding dimensionally different objects is how they might respond to things that happen with speed faster than their own. They might try to fight off a sudden movement that doesn't affect them, even when the speed is much faster.  Like how a baseball hitting outfield can get the ball out to his/her opponents, that isn't a problem with baseball, that's part and parcel of baseball. 
For example,  imagine that a football player is chasing a ball on its way out front, when this doesn't change the initial heading of it, it's still playing a path that leads towards the goal, regardless of what speed the football is. Even if it would run behind the player to avoid this guy - a move that could take two or three times longer - if they're just not getting enough speed, any time the guy is behind, it'll be past. Therefore, to deal with such cases, baseball teams have to prepare with this, especially when dealing with high-speed players.
In the above example above, you're effectively moving backwards, thus losing a step, not to mention getting stuck in traffic.  It's similar for all kinds moving objects.
What is happening here?
That's just a single example. You could do a number a little more complicated. Take a look at the equations, take any two balls and draw a simple line. Suppose you go about to divide this line by dividing the length of your two paths. Imagine these are completely different paths, both with constant speed. That way, you'll only get one half of this straight. Instead of moving forward and backwards simultaneously, they'd just be moving one step forward or backwards per second. Without the addition of any acceleration, this would still result in motion, although it isn't as rapid.  That's because speed doubles every second in this equation.
Now take the first of those balls.  Its trajectory is to hit the straight line between the two points, where this ball hits. With a speed of 10 feet per seconds, two times that time (

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the purpose of this whole series of posts is twofold - first, to demonstrate how mathematics can greatly help us understand complex phenomena in science and its applications to everyday (un)sciences; secondly, through all this, I want you to see something very simple - that the way we view reality is much simpler than we think. I will demonstrate this by showing your how the basic division of objects into categories can dramatically simplify our understanding of those things we would normally classify as categories. All the material to produce this post is available on my github page - visit it and download it. Thanks for all your support! ;)

Let's start the show down the track: when are we categorizing things?

Imagine you're out and about - perhaps in downtown Cincinnati or New York City - and you come across some interesting and curious items, like this!

Are you sure you want this item? Sure.
What makes this a good item?
I guess so, right?
Is this something we normally think of as a dog? Absolutely!
What do we look for when categorising a pet's type? Its colour.
So you can see that using the same analogy above, we're able to simplify the categorization problem significantly by simply focusing on the two characteristics that define a thing called a 'pet': its colour and the type of dog it looks like!

What a lovely idea! Imagine this....

We categorise the item and tell our family and neighbors about it! We even share the article in question online! Then we go on to tell other people about the fascinated discoveries we made! :) You can read up on 'What Do We Look For When Categorising When a Pet Or Animal Is Crazy' here: https://www.scienceandculture.com/what-do-we-recognise-by-animal-category

Well, not exactly! As you already know, categorisation is not simply assigning unique identification labels to things. It's a more complex process, especially when considering multiple or even more than two traits.

Let's imagine how complex it would become if the only way to categorize a piece of artwork were with two unique identifications - paint and artist. Well, this would defeat the very purpose for which we created art on one hand and human beings on another!

How would it be much easier once we discovered how many different categories there were? Now if you see a picture on display, what would you categorised it with? I bet you could identify it within a few minutes!

We can then use this information to make more educated decisions and judgements. You'd rather go to a museum and pick out paintings instead of buying on Amazon? Here is an analogy - imagine you've spent an hour watching some really interesting pieces of video music on youtube - how would that experience change if you're not certain about your choice of musician?
Now we're talking about categorical science! Even though the categories we decide to accept, classify and give names to seem to be relatively easy, in reality - there actually are a lot of rules involved. For instance, unlike humans, animals can distinguish between categories based on visual cues, rather than based upon what they do (for example, cats are often confused between dog bites and being attacked by wolves).
So how do animals categorically distinguish the items we just bought from a grocery store from items that need specialised care?
Answered! Categories and subcategories help - basically, categories separate objects based in part upon how they look, taste, smell and feel. Here are one more instances in which categorists would category:

Items with a texture like chocolate, are usually categorized as chocolate
Items that emit a scent like mint or peppermint are categoried as mints

In the above examples, these types of items are known as "positive" and negative respectively. Obviously our human brain can handle categories differently depending on what it recognizes! And if that doesn't bother you, well, you're one of us!
Now that we're ready to bring the world in sight of our eyes, how should we best approach the task of categoricking a unique name for a seemingly mundane or unknown item?

At a first glance, it's easy to believe that once you identify things as positive or negative, you'll know that a person is born into it - which is often the first step for parents to set things up. Ofcourse, that approach is incredibly naive and simplistic - people might look at a bunch of books and decide they don't like them all! The reality, however, is far more nuanced!

In other words: we can't just categoricate things simply because we're scared of them. We're not stupid! We're just not able/aware of all the things that exist in between.

How important is this to your life? Yes - it's absolutely critical! Because without proper categorification we have no way of answering the questions of what makes something interesting or what gives them a name! Without something categorifiable, everything else becomes more subjective and less obvious in nature.

In theory you don't have to actually categorice every single thing if there was none! To take one extreme example from the previous example: if all we were required to name every object was a single unique identifier - like a type, colour, or unique sound -

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the physics of reality is far too complicated to be understood by ordinary people...but we still have a few ideas about our physical world.
Let's begin with some basics.

What we see is simply the result of light rays being refracted by mirrors, lenses, water, air, matter...all of which are used to shape the light emitted by our eyes to see through!
But it's also not just that light is used: it also happens to pass through certain objects that are often called transparent media! These transparent objects act like mirrors to reflect light back at us, sending our sight into the mirror's image (or "dark field" - a dark shadow thrown in front of our vision) - which in turn creates the illusion that the object that we're actually looking - or even the entire world around us - is actually "visible" to me.
In fact, this is why you often see white walls - when the walls themselves are actually white, there's no need for glass to obscure the interior of an object: the whole world in white and the image of "white" inside the mind of someone who's looking through the glass are the same thing!

Once upon a time there were a couple of mathematicians doing research on the physical aspects of perception in their lab! Naturally, when their research came up with problems that couldn't be solved, these brilliant young scientists thought about what might be done to circumvent the problem - and they came to a conclusion called quantum mechanics.

If one considers the world as a quantum particle, in which each object has its quantum representation within it, it's possible for the objects to behave the way that ordinary objects do if they move relatively randomly along straight, uniform paths.
This would mean each ordinary object would eventually move on its way through an infinitely many different spaces, all while interacting with different kinds of things - some that might help, some that's not...and therefore never will help - at every point of its journey until it reaches a restorative position.
Now it seems that what nature intended to happen was...something along these lines!

As it happens, an article by one of these mathematicics researchers (that's not a typo!) suggested that a tiny piece of glass could be used as "transparent media", allowing the particles of all "objects in nature" (a huge list of various stuff in reality) and their quantum representations to come into contact with each other and not be affected anymore - in other ways described as being like "fishing"?

After all, quantum particles, as explained above, always have the option of moving along a straight path to their destination, whether or not they ever "stick together". That is, while we might see objects moving in random directions, that doesn't mean they aren't actually straight! There might have been other "hidden" particles and "hidden energy fields within the environment" that had interacted, causing those objects not to have straight paths to reach their final destination!

This leads to one very interesting puzzle: why would the shape of clouds, trees, sea creatures, animals and so on suddenly change drastically when they suddenly "dilate", or "droop down"? This would seem to suggest that quantum energy could also have an effect on these forms of nature! Well, apparently - but apparently because in Nature there might not exist such a thing as an illusion or an "illusion" is just a fancy way for people to describe their sense of "reality"; and since nothing is happening at all in real life, how can the real world look completely different from a virtual one? So how has this possible happened?

And what if one used the quantum mechanical idea of "fishin' in circles" instead of putting objects into 3D spaces to create fake 3D world? Would things still work? I mean, even when it comes to using quantum fields as means to travel, what happens when objects become stuck in some specific place? And if there was another way to explain the "flattering" of trees and rivers when people see them coming?

There is a lot of talk about "quantum gravity" as its name suggests - it essentially points to how some form of quantum physics could help solve the mystery of how things move around in space; and this way could even help explain much of what we've observed and what was previously only being described "astronomically"!

But one thing that still puzzles us all about all the theories on Quantum Gravity is how would it explain why gravity would not apply to particles? You seem like you know how gravity works! How about we take it a step further and look at what actually happens in your world that makes you "see" all objects differently?

Well, to start with, objects are really only affected when there exists a strong enough force between them (say, gravitational field) or the two particles touch! And again, that's all there really is - there has to really exist "other things" affecting the movement of objects!

Anyway, one thought experiment that has been done is to measure how "gravitational" a certain object is by taking it out on your arm and putting yourself in motion! Sounds good when you look around your room, yet when it's time for you to leave your bed, your mind immediately starts to try to figure out whether you actually have left your bedroom!

To better depict our understanding of these concepts, let's use a more simplified, 3+3+3+1 = 5! picture:

At this very basic level of understanding, in 3D space there will exist 2 different kinds of materials: light and dark. Light is an energy being made up of photons, while dark is a type of entity we don't really understand yet but is probably made as a different kind of particle than photons. Basically, every piece of light creates a photon. A photon can create every other type that exists in space!
How do light particles interact? How do photons interact collectively to create each other? Let's look at this example more carefully...

At any point in one of its three dimensions (x, y or z), every photon of every light entity creates another photon using a single, shared photon.
We can think of this process as photon creation. But now light must also interact in order for each photon to be able to interact with each photons next to it, creating a second photon (or group of them). Light must make separate particles at each point where it interacts. Each particle must be distinct from the particles created by similar photons in its neighborhood.
Basically, light can break up any kind, shape or structure that may exist and recreate an entirely new structure of something that didn't exist before. Like, how would we recreate grass? A bunch of grass sticks together like we normally do it and would form a green, healthy, green grass. Or how do we create sand? Sand can come from air and ocean and make a sandy beach or sandstorm. It is basically just sand.
However...if air can also turn into fire, water can change into steam, wind can turn to rain, salt can become sea water, ice can freeze water and a whole bunch other things, what if light could do the same thing with itself? Light can now become fire. Can it be frozen, or do different particles need different temperatures to form ice? Can this be repeated a thousand times to build all different combinations of objects?
How does this all make sense? In a nutshell, all that matter is now contained into light. Everything that moved around in 3D was made out originally from light...that's how photons exist. All matter in light is contained within light.
In other words: if the universe was started out from nothing at all, everything would literally be a cloud of nothingness. For each single photon, nothing would ever exist, as there would have been no light to begin with.
How would light create other types of things? Yes, this is not at the very core of quantum mechanics which is completely different. Here light actually forms and dissolves to recreate all other physical forms. Also, each type (s) of physical form exists exclusively within the light itself. That is, only light makes up each form.
So, by combining all light, particles of anything will form all possible objects. Only light would make each physical object.
A more in-depth look into the "how-to" of creation will get to these topics later. These concepts are just the beginning!

A:

The main difference between energy and matter on one side and particles on the other is the principle of conservation. Where matter has no kinetic energy (such as electrons or protons), light does have kinetic energies, though they come at a price, namely that of heat and inertia, with a limit if that principle is violated.
For instance, sunlight can heat a surface; a hot molecule, having more energy than the heat required to drive it through solid state physics (in a sense), can gain energy from it on thermal time scales. Since the radiation being produced is moving, that results in heat.
These are examples of what conservation can really mean. Although the energy in these cases is less intense than could be produced as particles moving together (as would result from quantum effects and other nonclassical phenomena) the effects aren't great, because for these energy mechanisms to exist an amount of unreabsorbed energy will also have to occur.
All energy has to have a corresponding unambiguous "energy", not just some form of radiation, like light.

A:

(1) It seems like you're doing fine. There are several things not mentioned:
(2)  It's important that everything you use in your calculations and theorems is valid, i.e. it must include everything that must exist at some level to obtain the results given. Anything that you do not explicitly mention must appear in those.

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our theory about dimensional concepts, let's describe our favorite mathematical concepts: vectors. A vector is a mathematical structure that contains all the information needed to describe a space or situation - both spatially and temporally. Let us start by defining a vector as simply a couple (x, y) for any point (p) in 3D or 2D space. For example, in 2D, X (the 3D position) is represented using either 0 or 1, Y (for 3D); and Z (in 2D) - and so forth...

Now, imagine two vectors with equal length. Both vectors will point in exactly the same direction, regardless of which other vectors they contain. But that's not all! Imagine a second vector that has length twice the length of it's first cousin. Clearly this second "vector" will have a non-zero length only in one direction - it's length will "be doubled!" If both vectors had length one, as you suggested above, both "vectors" would point precisely the exact same way. When applied to situations, vectors come in many varieties.
What about a situation that consists of two or more vectors? Let's consider such a structure more closely.

Imagine the scenario below. You've run on for a while and don't feel like you can keep going! You have wandered off toward the direction of some hidden treasure...something you know very little about! Something called the Hidden Path will guide you back! According your current location, you'd arrive at a hidden door! However once you open that door, you're suddenly not in any known direction. Where is the hidden place on the map?

The Hidden Way of Knowledge provides you with a visual, or even a tactile, route to find this treasure!! In order to obtain this knowledge, you'll need a magical instrument called a "map". Unfortunately, this map contains no way of knowing exactly where you're supposed to be headed. Without a map, only a vague route might help us get there! What's the best route through the Unknown? A map would surely be a great help, wouldn't it?
To create your map - you will need two items! First, one of them is simply some kind of compass - a small stick with an internal compass. Second, your key will contain a magnetic bar - it should be pointed in at the center, like this.

Let's imagine your compass and map in positions A and B below, respectively. You will now select one end of each of these two maps and insert them into the other. Then make sure that the two compass points are aligned, similar to this:

Now just keep inserting your two selected maps into each other - making sure you insert the compass point one at time. Keep inserting until you've inserted the appropriate length (e.g. a length 2), making a single map that fits your situation perfectly.

So when you're done inserting the maps, put the inserted maps together and see what you're looking for - there should now be the correct direction! If you're not sure what's correct, look for something that looks more like a cross rather than a straight line!
Now we have our map! As you see, it's a circular path. Here are the different paths in four different directions:

I think we should immediately recognize that our path would appear to follow exactly this circular route: that way it's easy to locate our hidden location. Moreover, our location is also clearly not related to a place (hidden door) on our destination map; rather it exists within the space which we choose to travel in.
So far so good! Now let's see how we could "build" this path by applying the principles of maths! Let's start again with our four 2D locations...which were all already drawn on paper!

In order for A to appear as a valid location in B, we're going to assume that A lies in position E - as shown here! To make A appear in E, we'll insert a number "e" into A so that x = e:

We now have two numbers, "e and e" that are equal in length! That means that "x" must equal "y":

Next we must decide how many dimensions we'll go from A into E. Since y is one and equal (to e), we'll place the first number (E - e) above the second one (A - x), as indicated here!

This works! We now understand our situation and the way we'll use mathematics to create our final path:

So let's use the fact that y = 1 to insert our first dimension "E" into place A. Next, note how this line of height 1 connects us to y. Recall, x is set equal one. After inserting "E," we now know it's equal height to x one! But since our goal is to combine the height of x and y values into an overall height "y" - then we apply the basic equation for height - in order at least create an upward vector, we'd need the following equation:

And we simply insert "+" (1) to put E above A (see figure 2 above...this step is actually a little trickier...just follow it step-by-step!).
Now this upward "doubled" value y has to add up to equal the value of our second dimension...let's say we used a value "2"! Thus,

This new position now has

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the level of mathematics abilities of ordinary human beings, let's look at some basic mathematics skills like addition and subtraction, addition of integers, multiplication, divisions, fractionation, equivalence, percentage, tables, patterns and other useful calculators. These basic skills are critical for mathematics as they develop children's cognitive abilities that enable them to easily process and apply math in their lives!

In this part, we're going to show you how children become better at learning to add, subtract, multiply, divide, sum, times and take an average of two integers. We'll explore what is involved with these skills and how they help children develop their cognitive functions so that they're more comfortable in math!

All these basic concepts - addition, subtractions, division, fractions, quotient and average - are essential to being a good mathematician.

Summing two numerical values - for example a number 10 and the two following numbers 2 and 9 - is a common problem faced by most children!

We want our children to be more able to put these numbers into their proper ratio, making their calculations easier and less frustrating.

For example, using our above example from our previous chapter and adding these two numbers we get
10 + 2 = 15
2 + 3 = 9
3 + 7 = 18
7 + 17 = 31

The above calculation gives us an answer of 9. Because we're adding 10 2 + 15 + 9 = 35, we've found the right ratio:
35 ÷ 2 15 = 36, or 1.5

Multiplying two values with each other - like 9 and 36 - can develop a child's thinking abilities!

For example:

Add 9 to 36 and find the answer

9 + 36 = 51
36 ÷ 9 51 = 3

A:

For me (the OP) adding and subtracting aren't so hard to master but the division and finding the ratio is tricky.
I'm not sure I can say that I've ever been able fully competent in some areas in life, though I do remember learning multiplication and division as babies. I think they were the areas that I was best able (and not very stupid) to figure out as a child.
My first attempt at studying math was a few months back when I had the chance and decided to try out. Initially, I would try to do the math for one thing and then add the other. Well I'm a messy, crazy person so I probably didn't understand it, as did my sister. She was so happy that she could solve it herself and I wasn't :P After that, maybe two or three times a week, I'd do it for her, until her sister could do everything for no problem whatsoever.
Anyway, while I'm not able 100% on the problem, at least I managed to help her understand what she was doing. Her brother was in grade 5 (now he is 7) so they had a lot of fun doing the tasks with him! :) I also remember going back on to other math subjects (like algebra, geometry, physics) when my brother had an argument with his teacher and had no idea what his sister (6) was talking about. At that time I could understand some math but wasn't that good. They were such a sweet couple (but that was years ago) :)
So as for math lessons, my first year of primary school started by having to learn about money (money is really important for most people and most countries). My first lesson was from a kindergarten teacher, who said we needed to find and explain how much money we had left on our birthdays. All I knew at the time was how many days I have left to my birthday and when I'd get to have another birthday, how would I be able find how I know how far I left. Later on in school, in first grade, math teacher gave us some problems we should be solving, to give us practice on how we would solve such problems! 
Our teacher was always talking into the blackboard so we could take notes (which we didn't use after first). We had very few resources, apart from the ones that the teacher made us because she kept them close by, like our pens, pencils and papers. Also a pencil was brought every time my father would show us how best to draw the figures on paper (not to mention books on drawings and learning how our shapes fit on them). These things, were my only good friends and allowed me to practice drawing things.
At school all problems were solved by taking things on as an exercise. For example in 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade we were asked how high we went when moving from 0 to one height, from 1 to two heights and so on. Some people got it right, others struggled but everyone found their way. Our maths tutor thought that some people that were very clever can still learn the lesson in such short time and learn to apply that knowledge when they get an opportunity!
I can remember the teachers were teaching our little brother about geometry (especially the geometry of an ordinary cube) and he was very interesting on it. Afterwards when he would take his time while doing his homework, he'd always be giving me a drawing that he did on himself in it (by simply drawing in his notebook in black and white), which would illustrate the question that day

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the power of mathematics in understanding our physical world, it's best to remember that this world is made not of physical objects, rather it comes formed from ideas. A great analogy goes like this: if you wanted to be a highschool student - you don't need much to make a perfect mathematical problem, or even a better solution to one - but once you're in high school you've already acquired the ability to effectively solve problems to learn things you need! As well, when you're a student, there's hardly any time for things like thinking, observation, problem solving, creativity, learning, practicing, self-awareness - there isn't a lot of development that happens for you! Now let me tell you about what happened when Einstein took on the task of writing his great work The Theory of Everything! The math work that Einstein went into was so meticulous that he actually had the time to devote to thinking about the various scientific concepts that were going into his work - and then of course he didn't just write it down by himself - he sent it over to other mathematicians to help him figure out what was the best way to solve it! When Einstein finally had it all figured out, he then wrote it out in his own handwriting.

In the past, people had to sacrifice so much in order to gain admission to a university, whereas now they only have to spend a few hours in class! This can have a negative impact on individuals, however; the loss of so many hours of free time can affect the way students think mathematically. On the other hand, having students spend some time thinking mathically also makes them more creative and independent, in turn, leading to better results from schools, higher wages, more scholarships, successful careers, greater self-confidence, academic achievement, lower taxes, better health (to name a couple)! Now that you've read those short and easy-to-follow lessons in math, I hope it helped your understanding of math!

A:

I don't think you can take anything out from this and apply it directly in some way as an understanding that a "quantum field" is really a field that represents spatial position; it's just a little different from that. Even if I take it as a suggestion in that analogy the field can't be defined over all space so it needs to have some boundary defining properties. For instance, I'm not sure that you know how it's actually defined at the boundary so you shouldn't be taking the analogy of quantum fields as literally.

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how people learn and understand mathematics, here are two examples of graphs that represent different mathematical concepts. Note that both of these graphs come from the same author (Albert Einstein) and all three represent the concepts of "area" and "perimeter". It would appear that most people can simply visualize a curve with two lines representing the two end points of that curve as they mentally connect and draw other shapes on top of it. Of more surprising, yet true, is the fact that this simple form of reasoning already exists and it's only a matter of learning and practicing. Some people are experts at thinking about and drawing these lines for themselves, whereas others must make use of one or more of their instructors or mentors to help them in this process. What I'm about to talk about in detail about is a better understanding of how mathematician use their mathematical skills to create new, creative mathematical patterns or graphs using mathematical terms and concepts.

Let's call this mathematical term "Generalized Arithmetic" - simply, generalized arithmetic makes the idea of multiplying multiple numbers easier to grasp and use. A good example of what generalized geometry is all about comes from famous physicist Albert Einstein:

If you notice, your hands can become more flexible when they move along curved lines, because they don't have to follow straight trajectories in between, like they did in order to turn from straight line to curved. But you can still move very swiftly even when you are walking along a smooth path. Then maybe it wouldn't be so strange if there was some kind of universal law that determined that a person could go along various types of paths without taking into consideration the shape of his/her body, unless he's also walking at an extremely high speed.

In addition, scientists have been studying how geometric shapes such as triangles as well as straight-line lines - also known as lines having the property that any of an object's normal vectors (i.e. parallel lines to that object) will share the vector's same direction regardless of which other parallel vector it lies on - form a mathematical concept called trigonometry. One of our main reasons for being interested in trigonometry; however, isn't to see how this concept could be used to make new creative patterns and graphs?
In fact, we'll be studying several mathematical characteristics called functions to further dive deeper into what mathematical shapes or patterns could eventually emerge under more specific conditions. These functions include sine, cosine (called cosine of theta number, or cosine function), inverse cosine, square root, logarithm, sine function minus logarithm and exponential function.

If we start by learning trigonom trigonometric functions (which includes some trigonometrics functions such as: sine and cosine), we then start learning more about the underlying mathematical principles of generalizing and generalization concepts and principles. We'll start with the sine function:

Sine of any angle is cosine plus sine of angle minus 2pi times angle.

For example, given an angle of 36 degrees in radians, where there would have normally be 4 different possibilities for sine (0, 12, 18, 36), the following formula can help to simplify the process of calculating the true cosine values of angles.

cos(36°) = 36° + (4° - 1) sin(18°)

If we're given a vector (say, x) which is parallel to an oriented line through a circle, what can we say about that line and its angle (θ)?

θ = 90° (or 135° depending on which side you're sitting on).

The sine value of this angle would be:

sin(θ) ≈ 90 - (2θ - 2π)/2 ≈ 72°

Now note that's because the angle vector is pointing from north to south, that for the line going from -90° to 90 degrees, every point along that directed line would receive an opposite signed quantity, hence this results in it "being the sum of its opposite." As the lines' angle decreases in size, their cosine value decreases and the vectors begin to share their directions.
In the above example below, let's consider the particular case where the circle is centered on the x-axis at the center and whose circumference is twice the length of x. Assuming that the x-direction is perpendicular to it's own circumference, both x and y axes must line up perpendicularly with a straightline between their corresponding points; hence, this line is going through -180°.

sin θ ≈ −72° = -60° -- Note, while we have a −180 to -120° circle we can't divide 360° in half without violating the angles. Therefore, at angles of -122° and -152°, y must equal 0. Because it would violate the formula for both -45°  and  45° angles.
Straight-line segments can also be defined by mathematical equations based on those lines.

sections xy = length s * angle t

Where sections and length are parameters defined in terms of straight segments' lengths and angles at their respective beginning points.
This section would not line-up directly with every portion of each of those straight segments, however (it would lineup with some other line that share angles between the given segments' start points), since the intersection of two straight sections can take any shape with respect to their specified vector. Thus, even though it doesn't line with

## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how various dimensions affect higher-dimensional entities, let's look at two commonly used mathematical concepts - ESFP and MDP. 

Given a vector space V we have a one-dimensional vector subspace (V,1) as well as V \ {0} - that part that corresponds to vectors of zero coordinate - which is the null space of V. By definition, any vector u ∈ V can also be written as u = u + uv where u and v are vectors in V and u, v ∈ (0, 1) respectively.

Equality and Parallelism
In a two-dimensional space, equality (denoted by "∼") is represented as x y ≈ x + y. Equality in higher dimensions is actually the opposite of that. For an equality x x ≈ v, this means that all components of both x and y must be equal; otherwise we would have x = y, meaning x ∼ y.

In addition, parallelism (also denoted by "+ = " ) represents the idea that two points are related (equivalent) if they have similar coordinates. Note that not all points in high-dimensional space are equivalent or similar, however - many points just don't have any relation at all. Take, say, two particles in four dimensions A and B. Both have the same mass M and therefore the speed of light c. One in each direction would move at the (relative) speed and would therefore be equivalent. But given the relative spatial distance between them, A would still be faster than B if it was traveling parallel to B... But when moving in parallel on A, B can not move faster... In fact, using this property, particles moving under the influence of gravity would actually move slower than those not in motion. Here is an example demonstrating this.

As we move away from us, gravity becomes stronger... and so does speed...
As particles collide, their velocities decrease. When they come to rest, one particle might accelerate relative the other in directions that point toward it. Particles moving at more than the normal speed would thus decrease in speed. Or, when they collide in both directions, an acceleration at both velocities would happen.

A:

One can see that the definition of ESF gives an intuitive picture here.

An ES F is a linear relation (linear isomorphism) from the field of sets to that of vectors. Two vectors X and Y are ES-F isomorphic if for every equivalence relation between X,Y we obtain another isomorphism. That is if X ∼ Y then there exists a unique equivalence class contained in X with elements X(y) and elements Y(x), where y is less than or equal X so that Y ∼ X.
ESF are useful in applications such as automated theorem proving, reasoning and reasoning engines and many more.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematical concepts that are introduced throughout Chapter Threezirten, let's take another look at these concepts in some detail. We've already discussed the number and area concepts for the past ten chapters, while we now study some more basic geometric concepts such as curvature and perimeter. Here, we'll take one more step and consider spatial relations between items.
Spatial Relations
Spaces are composed of three basic elements: Points, Lines, Curves. We'll use these three element types to create several other objects, in order to demonstrate how these objects work in combination with each other and how they work with the concepts discussed up to now.
Points: Each point represents a physical location. When we try to draw a plane passing by every point in space, it'll tell us that there's nothing at all going on inside of that plane! Because space is defined in terms of 3-dimensions, it's very difficult to define and measure something that isn't a 3-dimensional object. To solve that problem, specialists have developed many different ways to measure the distance between any 2 or more points.

For example, to determine the length of two points, you'll need a set of measuring sticks. You'd need something like those to set aside points A and B, measure B to B and A to A, get A-A, A-B, B-A and so forth... Then, based on the known distance from A or B (both known from your measuring stick), divide up the points on any line into sections, using your special measuring tool, like calipers. You'll then need some number like "500" to divide these sections up into 50 units. Then you only need point to check for accuracy. Or if you want, that 100mm measuring tape can go in place of all these measuring tools.
For lines, lines that meet at a single point will always be straight. Line segments with a finite length are continuous but have no straight line endings. These can often be subdivided into shorter, more elementary lines known as sections. Each area of continuous area will have one end, often called the "point of intersection" and called a "terminus", with all other halfspaces being called "halves". A boundary exists at the point of origin and a boundary can end abruptly; the opposite of an abrupt boundary is known in engineering as a "cap".

Perimeter: All 3 dimensions form a continuous surface and they all have boundaries that divide the entire space into 2 parts. They are just lines with different lengths in each half space.

Area: Each of these 3 dimensional shapes can share their area; the sum of their areas equals the total area.

Curvature (or Area): The curvature (area) of any set is a shape that defines the area (length) by how much the curve changes based upon the amount of movement along the path. Using the geometry definition of perimeter, two objects may also have the same perimeter; however, they're not the identical shape. Curve segments have different curvatures, depending upon where the end points are. Therefore, given the perimeter and areas involved, I suggest we take the arc length (arc tangent), which is the difference in distance (straight line length) between two sides. Since the circumference of 2 circles have a ratio of 1=2, this gives us the ratio, 2π/pi, of curvature over areas, where π= 3 radians is given as 2π.

Since we defined the volume by dividing space by perimeter (= circumference), two sets that have equal perimeter will also share the 2-sphere of volume.

So let's use all three of this information to compare two different shaped things. For example let's say we wanted to find one of our own - our apple! Now if my apple were perfectly circular and perfectly flat on Earth, my diameter would equal the square root of my volume (π*π = π/6 = 0.618). On the 3-spheres, that's 0,618* π = 1.414. On my three-spherical apple, though, because it doesn't fit perfectly on my surface, there's extra curvature, as well as areas; when I'm on it, I've got a 1,414* my perimeter - 3*2 = 6.14.6. Of this, what I'm really measuring is 6,14* 2π = 2.54. By dividing the circle, by our radius, we're dividing up each circle into 36 equal parts and dividing these by 36 = 5.84. Hence the result is 2,54* 2 π * 2π/5.8 = 14.38.18.7.  On further dividing that figure by 2 - 2 * 1/6*36 = 8.36 we obtain the value of 8 /√5.88 = 3,071.1.

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mind and soul, mathematics will often be interwoven with the notion of ESP science - ESP is the area of natural sciences studies the development of human intelligence, cognition, emotions, thought and feeling.

Although mathematicians tend to talk of mathematically thinking, ESP scholars tend more to refer to thinking mathically, thinking in ESP terminology. There is usually one definition for thinking or intellect per person, regardless of education, gender, race, or experience, however

ESP theory seeks to define and explain how people and societies process and perceive information in order not just to live but thrive. 

The process of mathematics and mathematics studies in particular is deeply impacted by ESP theory

One of several factors which shape our world is our social cognitions. These form the basis of how humans create mental representations and interact with one another, that in turn form our understanding of our physical world and the world around us.

If you are unfamiliar with what ESP and ESP-related literature are, here are a few definitions and a couple of excerpts from Wikipedia:

Esp: Information Systems Psychology

Essentially, Esp is a discipline that studies how we perceive, communicate, interpret and understand information (a term that's also applied to computers and programming), for example, by learning how our brains process visual, auditory, tactile, cognitive, affective and kinesthetic information, as well as how social interactions impact our cognitive processes.

ESP refers to:

The study of information processing in general
Visual, Auditory and Somatosensory
A number (from a) number

Mathematically Thinking is different

It is important to differentiate from more traditional math skills, like: counting, algebraic thinking and addition and subtraction. It is necessary to apply math in ways that lead to deep conceptual answers (rather than a quick application of simple calculations on the fly) and to recognize and utilize the different perspectives we have about mathematical concepts.
Mathematics: A term that encompasses both mathematics:

Conceptual thinking
Mathematical thinking is also a critical component of critical thinking. Mathematicians consider concepts and relationships from many perspectives.

When referring to intelligence per se, this generally refers to some kind of ability - but the term ESP has an interesting use for entities in 5D:

This particular point of view is not typically seen in popular media, where intelligence is often equated with math.

In order to examine the relationship between intelligence and math, some researchers have performed experiments with students to measure a person's mathematical skills.

Some mathematical thinking has been associated with learning and developing an idea. Some people think that mathematics is directly related to other sciences such as physics and biology, because mathematics-related ideas help students understand what they learn or know. By studying mathematical ideas, students can use these ideas to develop a deeper understanding; however, many students do not have an understanding in math because of previous experience of reading and learning mathematical texts, when compared to their physics or biology counterparts.

While we don't have direct knowledge of whether math helps with reasoning, intelligence shows the following correlation:

In general, higher intelligence people are found to have better skills in solving problems such as: logic, statistics, geometry, algebra, solving questions, analyzing problems, identifying patterns, developing solutions and formulating ideas.

It has also been proven that people who do math tend be better in mathematical calculations, while people without math experience tend have lower math scores and performance when participating in other academic tasks. For example a study by John H. Hancock showed that a statistically significant difference in student math abilities existed between two groups: those who took AP Mathematics and those in which the AP had not been given, although both groups did the Math. Other studies by Daniel and David S. Anderson found that math students who were math-proficient had a higher math score than the non-math-professional. Furthermore, math proficiency seems to correlate with mathematical reasoning and solving complex problems.

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict what happens to higher-dimensional entities during their journey through the universe's dimensions (more specifically space, light, matter), we must first understand what kind of structure these entities are built of. There are numerous structures you can imagine (in this case, many of those would seem to be impossible), so we'll simply take one of these and attempt to describe it...

So what is the structure of this object? An enneagrams is basically a type of shape-shifter - it's basically made from the shape/shape of two or more objects you put together! The shape of an ennéagram gets altered in various ways depending on what the objects are, where they come from, what their connection points are - if you connect two different parts of your body, your shape will get shifted in some odd way! If we had our ennés on board, we'd see these shifting transformations as they changed our bodies!

The basic idea of enameagram topology is pretty simple. Any entity that takes part in an activity that involves two objects or parts/parts - we call that relationship a tie - will then experience changes to its shape during that activity. For example, let's say you cut your finger open, or cut someone else a limb! This would send them into the dimension of damage. Then if they were in contact with another part or parts, something else would happen to their enames. You can tell me how this works - and I'll tell you how it might effect you!

To put it into short, ennageagram topology allows an entire organism to participate in many different activities - not just one or two. Because of its many connections, an organism, by virtue of being called a'shape-shifting organism', can experience shifts in its shapes quite easily when other organisms are present at the same time and in identical connection configurations. These are the changes that will happen due to shape shifting (or other forms of dimensional travel) and other influences as well!

Well, how does an ordinary entity experience this? Let us imagine you are holding a large piece of paper with your fingers on each side (think a giant folded sheet of papier-mâché!) and that a tiny piece is touching the paper from your right-handed side. What will become of that finger? For the time being I will assume it goes into either of four different "ways". Well, all I'm trying to say is how exactly a finger enters one such way or another while also being in direct contact of another, smaller piece.

In a nutshell, two fingerlets or pieces of different size have contact and the bigger one (the large part) goes through four paths before it gets stuck in one tiny way (let's call this way 4) - it then makes way 1 (way 1 is a little more "way 4" than way 2). Then the tiny contact moves the big fingerlet through a path (called way 5) before finally going through way 6...and so on.

We can now put these ideas together a picture to illustrate it more clearly:

Since enamineagram theory suggests these kinds of connections can lead to dimensional shift and many other changes, we'll try to flesh this out a certain ways and then ask you the question to follow...

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the effect of different colors on our experiences, let's take the color wheel as an example. At one extreme, red stands for the most vivid colors, while the blue is the least. Going from right to left, green gets the middle spot, followed by yellow; orange has the lowest, whereas violet turns red! The same applies to vision, too. When we're looking directly at a colored light, our brain's neurons respond in an identical fashion to all three colors (which is why it makes sense that people are rednecks).

However when looking through a prism, different people see different colored colors. For example, blue has no direct effect on vision because it appears to be red light directly! But a blue-colored light when projected through an eye lens with a yellow color filter will cause the neurons within each yellow neuron to fire synchronously to that light - resulting in orange-yellow images. On the reverse side, when a pink-color light is projected, all pink neurons are excited, leading to a green image. Therefore, certain colors cause certain types of perception, depending on the type of object. Understanding this process allows us to relate colors to certain behaviors, emotions, situations, types, or even specific personalities - that's the fun of using colour to communicate!

As a bonus, remember that when people look at different objects, their brains also become excited by different areas of colors! We use our eyes to "read" objects around us, similar to how a camera works with pictures! As simple as this may sound, using colours and patterns can play a large part in any message! If our message is designed to stimulate the brain, people will respond differently to different colours.

However we also need more than just these eyes on us - we all need a better understanding of how colour influences people's emotions and behaviour. What if I told you that colour can influence your mood in more ways than you know? Or that colours can also change other aspects of your thoughts, like your reaction to an emotion? Can you tell me about some examples of these effects?

Well, of course you can! Let's take this discussion a step further and show you how each emotion will affect our colour perception at some point. One of my favourite theories in psychology is Color Motivation Theory. You can take it as a reference if you want a more detailed look...but you already know how it works! :)

So to do this we must understand what colour drives us. Color is like electricity: it has polarity, directional force and direction! This polarise color is how it's used to represent our emotions. There are three main colours: red, yellow and blue. All other colours have this same polarised red-blue-yellowscale - yellow for positive, positive for negative, negative for neutral, neutral for happy.

So when thinking back at our very first encounter with emotions in this world, maybe thinking of colours has helped our bodies identify and process negative feelings as well - like sadness and anger. Or maybe red and yellow were chosen because they represent blood and red blood is normally associated with positive emotions - and it might have helped us understand, communicate, express, control and remember positive feelings.

When our parents' voices begin to echo through our ears and we wake up, everything in life seems clearer. Our blood starts to flow faster due to red in its veins, meaning we start running faster. Yellow blood has its origins in animal life, as most animals have yellow skin and eyes. Also, at night, animals tend to hide in their burrows to make it easier to find them, protecting themselves from predators like coyotes and lions. These animals use their yellow eyes as warning posts due that they're less able to see through rain. Finally, after night falls, colors become a sign of new sunrise, reflecting our joy and contentment! Similarly when our mother cries and begins hushing us up...a big green glow appears in front of our eyeball! These colours are used as signals of anger and fear, helping us control our behaviour and reactions - all in order to help us communicate and communicate our needs!

By the way, what if something happens to your body that causes all your yellow or red to flick out? These feelings change all around you!

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the laws above apply to both the theory and the universe as a whole. Yet, to truly understand these principles, one needs to break them down into their individual parts so that one can understand what they actually are...

One should begin by understanding what spacelike surfaces are. Spacelikes are those regions in spacious space that are invariant under relativistic transformations such as time translation. Space-like surfaces arise because certain classes of objects can pass through such regions, like light or particles. Other classes, however, cannot.


Let's see how these two cases behave. Light particles (like photons) are classified into three distinct types according their shape: red, green, blue. There exists an arrow through a region where the light will appear red or green and then back again to appear blue after it travels through it. But given that photons are particles, light in transit will take whatever timescale it needs, resulting in light having passed over any number, arbitrarily many, spacels, or curves from red to blue.

A point of interest in this process is how well particles in general and light particles specifically pass spacetimes. It turns (with some hindsight) out to be somewhat of an unexpected phenomenon - most particles do not pass spacaces that arbitrarily closely resemble a light cone or curve. Furthermore, as has already been said, most light is absorbed, leaving their original state or other similar one after they pass. Thus, at least light's properties are quite different from that of photons, meaning their passage through spaces more closely resembles a trajectory in Euclidean space (which is a spacetime in which light and points all follow straight straight line paths...no curve).


In fact, all spacelines are actually curves in some sense - but if a particular space is curved, that space still looks like curve to those that observe it from a position inside the space. These spacebinary curves have both a length and an orientation - so when two space-like curves intersect each other, their intersection will turn out looking something like a curve! However this does not apply at all to light, because light never takes any sort the time to pass between two intersecting curves!

Given that spaceliike curves cannot be infinitely curved everywhere (as they would take infinitely far in space without having to make a detour) and that light does take some time (when it passes), it becomes clear to me that this must be a rather interesting example of nature at work!

Another interesting property of light (and consequently particles) is the phenomenon of wave reflection - light can either be reflected by surface or not be. For example, in order for a photon to lose a single energy before it splits into two, every wavelength must go through reflection, causing that photon's energy to decrease before splitting again into its constituent parts. Likewise, when an electromagnetic wave (electric or magnetic wave) hits a curved surface, no wavelengths of that wave can undergo complete reflection and therefore split back in two! Thus when photons pass over surfaces such that their energy goes through each reflected wavelength until only one is left, photons can have a continuous stream of energies that look like they travel straight through the curved spaces.

We also see that the notion that a wavelength represents a portion of some wavelength being reflected is somewhat inaccurate if one considers light being either reflected or absorbed. Actually, not all photons travel in any single wavelength and they may instead scatter or refract at certain places. By nature it would make no sense to split a laser pulse into wavelength components, given how far it (now thought to travel as light) went through.

In light of these and other apparent properties of physical systems, I believe that what physicists traditionally thought of as wave function can actually be interpreted as homology, something we should try and learn.

And, of course...let's say that homological groups are incredibly interesting, exciting fields of study! Let's take another look at some concepts related to homogenesis...

First, let me state that nothing is necessarily defined by one set of homologie groups. Rather, many homologous groups will define the same thing. Suppose that G and H are two homologically identical groups, representing the different possibilities of what you and I could be (from here on I will refer to G as 'hone' and to H as 'two-headed butterfly'). 
In a similar fashion to when you can identify a tree with multiple leaves and leaves with two different branches, G has many possibilities. Each can then correspond to different homologues - one head in H, two (two-way branches), three, four, five and so on. Imagine each of us, while riding on our hone, riding around and talking about the possibilities we now have. What is it that both of our choices share? And what is different about each choice that makes them unique? Each could possibly correspond in fact to multiple heads in exactly one of several other groups. (I will call these 'one-way and two-way choices' and talk about these later).
So why is this?
Because there would likely be several of each group, each representing a different choice. More importantly, groups such a this need not necessarily have to have the greatest number - there can literally be many different choices that could all be equal in size to one another

## Honest Game Design

To better depict the game design process, let's consider each of its components and ask ourselves some questions about their relationship to each other. At first, I'll consider the player's point of view, or what they look like when they play this game.

Player's Point of View as a Person
A player takes the role of one of these characters who is trying to solve the puzzle:

So what character is this person? Let's start with his name. Is this a name that refers to someone in fact that he may actually know? A name like "Lucas" could perfectly fit in here! Or perhaps he is a character from a different world, like a scientist (or maybe even from another planet...)?

What skills, traits, attributes, experiences, talents or gifts are associated with this character?

I know you'll be asking, "What are these things?" This part is really a combination of many other parts, though. Here's a summary of some possible descriptions: 

Technical skills: the ability to learn skills taught by other characters
Gifted with abilities which are unique for that being
Expert in one area of knowledge.
Knowledgeable about other players from the community
Knowledgable about this world
Conversant in multiple languages
Have a strong sense of fair play and fairness
Are sensitive and compassionate towards others
Care for humanity, nature, family, friendship, technology or any other kind of object that touches their heart
Respect other people and the values that people hold dear
Praise the virtues of kindness, charity, faith, sacrifice, honesty, justice and truth
Foster or defend other people's happiness
Will make an effort to bring happiness into the lives of others, either directly or indirectly
Been affected or influenced by their past actions
Wish to have a better future for their children
Love being with other human beings
Give good advice or tips
Take a good role model for the world or the future
Keep in touch with friends and family in other dimensions
Loyal to their former home on earth
Seek a fulfilling life for all their members
Act responsibly toward the planet
Evolve as part and parcel of evolution
Live well by living harmoniously with the environment and helping those who are suffering
Pride in using good judgment
Excellence in any area that counts

What actions or activities are normally performed in this role by this player?

This part looks like the typical "player's character description" - but it's really more like "a person's actions in action"! The core of how this thing plays off of each layer is the following....

In the normal state of play, this is basically just the usual actions and moves as you play the puzzles. Once you complete all the modules, your player character will enter the next section, where he or she will do a few more actions to enhance his or her abilities. Below is an example of what this will look like:

If you want more details, here are a couple of more important items: 

A "character sheet" (a table in which you can describe your character in more detail)
A "fame sheets", created by your players when they're in either "play mode" or "high score mode." You can list all your FAMES when you're "hardcore" play or rank your play on that basis. Fame can also be used to give a reward or add to your level

All of this information is combined in memory in your "Character Database" which is located at some point in "Player Inventory".

A:

You can find a guide to gameplay. I don't think there will ever be a clear-cut game. Each game will have its strengths and weaknesses, because that's how games are, not how physics works. But the general concept and process is pretty much the same. Most games offer two choices of player or world (so, two different ways to think of things) and each player is dealing with a set of problems as they progress through the adventure, sometimes in three or more attempts, that have different solutions depending on how cleverly the players find the solutions. There is, however, one final step called "hack". It is very common, in particular in older games where there were

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the importance of mathematics and cognitive analysis in science, let's turn to what goes on in cognitive science. By cognitive you mean the thinking about, understanding, evaluating and using scientific evidence; or the application of scientific methods to discover and solve problems or make observations. Although it doesn't have to be connected to mathematics, it's a good idea not to limit one's thinking to simply physical science.
In an earlier chapter we've discussed how the mathematics that defines what is physically possible is used in determining the scope of physical phenomena. Well, mathematicians are also experts at determining how meaningful information collected from physical reality can best be used to help the world solve difficult scientific problems.
So if you wanted to learn about the scientific community in general, you'd probably end up reading about some cognitive processes, not mathematics. To give those interested, we've included here a list of some mathematical terms that are used often to describe cognitive processes:

Entropy
Information density
Statistical reliability
The concept and nature
Cognitive maps
Fuzzy systems
Linear algebra
Functional analysis
Probability
Number theory
Mathematical geometry
Matrices and vectors
Bi-vectors and tri-vectors
Laplacian and its derivatives
Norms
Piecewise linear equations and continuous functions
Vector and linear transformation
Transformation matrices
Group theory and symmetry operations
Operators

Finally, even though we have learned very much about cognitive sciences as a whole in this section, we'll still try to keep the science of math's use within the confines of what science in in its proper sense; we're going to end with a few short paragraphs about why and how it's very useful to do mathematics in some areas of life.

Let's start with an illustration that demonstrates some common ways that math is very essential to all fields and areas. There are many physical sciences, like mechanics and the atomic and molecular level, that can't without mathematics to solve some very difficult problems. Of the nine fundamental forces that cause a body to obey the laws for movement, three are linear, two are angular, one is elastic, while two involve force and torque. Each problem is different - it's usually impossible to predict their exact result until we understand the underlying mechanisms.

At the time of Einstein, people had different ways of thinking. He saw that the three fundamental principles for mechanical behavior, as explained in his paper, could be generalized even to any kind of object that has physical properties such as mass, volume, energy and so on. A person can think of any object as basically a combination of two things; one, what it contains, called the "father" of that object, or "matter"; and two, how or why the object is made, also called its "typically used or purposeful form" or "type". These two concepts can then describe the action of most physical objects.
On May 15, 1915, at a news conference in New York, in front of 1,000 newspapers and broadcast media, Albert Einstein gave this great scientific advance in life, mathematics.

What you can see is the way in which the mechanics of physics fits in with mathematics - he explained how we could describe in terms of concepts and techniques both the motion of objects and their relationships to each other. His description of how inertia and gravitation, both concepts of nature, are related led him to develop a theory called gravitational theory that he used later in designing and constructing his solar and planetary orbits and other important space objects.

Mathematicians have long looked up to Albert Einsteine for great contributions in engineering, science and medicine, to explain a variety of natural phenomena that went unexplained by scientific inquiry. They often referred to Einstein and what he said about physics before it had been understood and thought out as "primitive scientific thought."
It became popular in England in 1904, when Albert Kohn published a book, A Mathematical Mechanics of Nature (Science Monthly, October 1904). This book was influential and important in helping English and American readers understand what was going on with the universe. Within a generation of its publication, Kahn was quoted in various fields, including journalism and education, where it became commonplace to call for the teaching of elementary physics and mathematics as science grew into its more rigorous state of being.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematics is used in real life, we'll use the well-known mathematician Bertrand Russell's analogy that he coined the word 'informed'. Informedness is a central concept in every aspect of our lives and all around the world. That being the reason we created this list of cognitive functions! Informativity is defined as being able to reason about a problem using logic, facts, reasoning patterns, evidence, or some combination of these.

We can begin by explaining the basic logic of reasoning by constructing a simple mathematical statement and seeing if the following proposition is true:

If A is the proposition at hand, B is B's immediate contradictory, C is C's immediately contradictive, D is D's contradictorily opposite, E is E's directly opposite to A, F is I(F) = B, G is G's opposite directly to E...

Notice how each element of B and its immediate contradictions are the same as each other. On the other hand A's direct opposite is A. Also note how E and B are different so that E cannot be I. I does not have an immediate opposite - which is why only three elements need be added to show I is not true! But this isn't the only way we might interpret the statement. You can think about it like so: if A was true, would it be true if E or C were true? Also, does B or F contradict I directly?

Now take this logical sequence out to a world that doesn't have any laws. It would end up looking something like this:

But let's think more closely about this simple statement in order to better understand the concepts we just defined in relation to its meaning. For example, let us consider a couple of people deciding for themselves if this statement was right or wrong. Both of them would say:

That depends on how you look at it. To me it sounds reasonable that a person can determine whether the truth of propositions directly from the content or consequences of those propositions.

So if you know that you can use logic to deduce the true statements, why not also deduce that the conclusion of what this sentence says is false? Why not deduce this at a much faster, easier, less painful, and/or less stressful pace? We are all familiar with some form of logic - it's what taught us how the universe works and helped us navigate through our world: from our family members, friends, neighbors, professors, governments, to scientific investigations. That's basically why our intellect is like a logic box!
However in reality the logic we use isn't all that complex. Just by seeing statements like This statement is wrong, can I deduce it's true from how everything fits together in this situation? You know the answer to that! Yes, it's easy. We're not talking about just trying to guess about the underlying logic behind a statement, we're talking real-life situations that aren't all about logic.
What are we using it for? This idea may sound strange, let's not forget that humans use this thinking to help us reason when we're in an intense conflict or when making decisions about our own lives. One of my favorite moments of thinking came when I was writing an essay for my high school project. It's part description of how I'm thinking about my essay because it wasn't too complex and I used the rules taught in school. After writing it, I saw myself struggling to communicate its purpose to others because of some flawed logic I had misheard, misunderstood, unintentionally, accidentally or otherwise. At that moment the thought came to me that if I knew how I did that, I'd be able use my own logic too. Because if logic was my only tool, how would I know if my statement about what should I do actually stands up to scrutiny? I started to think that most people are just too lazy to really understand math, even when it comes to applying it in daily life.

But why isn't logic so much of an impediment to understanding our society and the scientific laws we call scientific? That should come as no surprise if we're not familiar enough with science! Since we only know a little about mathematics, where is logic going to be of significant help in understanding and explaining our scientific ideas? The answer is pretty simple. Even though we don't have the mathematical knowledge to actually answer all the questions we ask about science, there's a good chance we have some useful ideas about concepts from physics and other sciences. 
But the biggest concern for scientists is how we explain to non-experts the new ideas we make on the fly or in retrospect. These ideas are often called hypothesis. They are usually built from logic and intuition, because they're much more open than mathematical theories or laws, making it easier for others to test them and see if they really work. But we know how hard it was for mathematicians to explain the laws and mathematical rules using just logic or intuitive reasoning - it took a few thousand years to develop a really good understanding of that!
In fact, scientists started learning about scientific concepts long before they realized the importance of geometry and math! For instance, Galileo, someone who worked all his life as a scientist, understood that when one has something that makes a group of objects behave in strange ways, either it's a circle or if two other objects that make the group behave similarly to each

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what happens when you apply mathematics to real life situations, we've chosen to break up this course into four chapters.

In the first chapter we'll review the various aspects of mathematics that relate to each application. We'll begin by discussing how mathematics can help us identify real-world issues in order to make the best decisions possible. Then we'll discuss the role of mathematical models, mathematics in solving problems, probability, statistics, analysis, proofs, axioms, numerical methods, functions, differential equations, algebraic equations/geometric equations and numerical analysis!

In Chapter Four we'll look at topics specific to mathematics. These topics include: probability and statistics; linear algebra, inequalities, trigonometry, calculus, linearized differential and algebraic systems, exponential functions; geometry, vector space over finite fields, finite automata theory and graph theory...

In chapter Five we'll take our math lessons a step further. You'll look into: mathematical proofs and formal logic; abstract algebra and group theory; integer arithmetic and complex numbers; algebra with operations such as subtraction, addition and multiplication, determinants, polynomials, factorials, series, power equations; complex analysis; and linear and vector spaces over a field!

We hope you'll find this book informative, fun and helpful. Please feel free to share in any of these articles, or use them as inspiration to create your own. Our goal is for you to learn and enjoy what you're learning! Thank you so much!

This book is a collaborative effort between math-aphil and John Hemphill. Thank-you!

It's time to dive into the history of geometry. Take a walk through the time from the origins of our planet to when humans moved from Africa to America. It will help you understand better the mechanics of how gravity works. It's a lesson in history that you cannot learn in class. Also learn about the theory that light travels at the speed of light. Last but not least, let's take this time for a quick look ahead to 2015.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our view of nature, mathematics can help us make sense of reality. Imagine that the universe can have only two possible states: in motion and unmoved. It's easy to picture a person walking towards or away from his/her destination without ever stopping at anything - he is just rolling on the ground at the moment. Math and science are the only tools that are available to explain this phenomenon: mathematics is the mathematical form of our observations of phenomena, whereas physics is our physical insight into the phenomena we're observing.

It's important to realize that if you try to find the cause of death of one of your friends, most likely you will find that he or she was killed by you! Why? Because you didn't look at him or her carefully enough after they passed away. Physics has some answers to these and other similar questions, as will follow.

In science, different elements are connected and studied to solve problems related to a particular type of object, class of materials, or group of people. These elements form various "models". For example, in biology we study things like animals and plants, bacteria and fungi, plants and animals, minerals and rocks, life and death, man and woman, space, matter and form, particles and fields, atoms, photons, radiation, quarks and gluons, nuclei, neutrons, elementary particles, dark matter - and so on...and so forth!

Mathematics is a discipline that attempts to apply mathematically the concepts of science found in other disciplines. Usually, these concepts are foundational to other forms of math - algebra, geometry, statistics, probability, calculus, differential equations,... and in some areas other areas of mathematical philosophy and mathematics that seek to incorporate the ideas of mind and mental processes, including the study of consciousness, logic and reason. 

Some mathematical theories, theories of physical processes or phenomena tend to fall under the umbrella of logic which is composed of mathematics for its mathematical logic, while others tend not to. There are also theories that study and relate to logic but not mathematics, science or physics...

In general, Mathematics is concerned with both physical and non-physical phenomena. It also studies nature from a human standpoint in order to provide a better understanding to society at large. Most mathematical studies are considered as research rather than teaching. All mathematical research is empirical and theoretical, with limited use of any computer algorithm or software in most cases.

With mathematics being so central to everyday knowledge and understanding, some people are tempted (either through reading too many books or doing homework too much) to ask these questions:

Why is math relevant to everything in life?

My sister says math isn't always useful!! Why couldn't she have learned a different language than English that was more fun?

In some cultures, math is viewed as part and parcel of spirituality, mythology, tradition and religion, although it varies widely depending on culture. A few cultures only allow students to have a basic understanding about math, often giving a high marks on tests, rather then having them participate in classes. You can google "math for culture studies" to learn more about some interesting cultures.

Mathematical learning is not restricted to school. Even after leaving school or college, mathematicians continue in their careers and pursue careers/professions related. Although this tends to happen mostly among young people, older individuals may choose to become a math professor

There are plenty of websites on Math for Culture, Philosophy And the Arts.

As for physics the main things we commonly study are those of mechanics. Mechanics is one the six branches of physics and is actually the most elementary branch. Unlike other branches or areas that attempt to predict and explain physics from the outside, mechanical is rather based on observation of behavior and action. Using different physical tools to study physical principles that cause mechanical action, it's possible to see an individual perform actions as desired by their environment.

Everybody seems to be asking about "what happens if a student knows math but forgets it", because this has never really mattered in higher education. Of all the theories and explanations for events in daily life, physical science holds the largest amount of research. Students in physical sciences are required to engage in research, projects, experiments, simulations, experimenting, discussions, puzzles, animations, lectures, workshops, videos, podcasts, articles and research papers throughout the year. They study natural objects, human-made objects and environmental problems to gain insight and to enhance basic knowledge about them. Such scientific activities are encouraged for their students at all levels to develop an analytical mind, an interest in discovering new scientific ideas and the ability to critique information.

Physics is an incredibly important subject, providing us with a deep understanding of how everything works in nature and it also a tool to help make things easier to read and understand by humans. One of reasons why we choose physics over others as a subject is its ease of use and popularity as well as its ability in many cases to connect to reality and everyday events.

Although everyone prefers math over physical, both fields have their roles in providing a unique method of understanding and explaining things in existence. Physical sciences continue their investigation to answer questions and explore new questions from everyday experiences and ideas. Mathematics on other hand, provides students with an understanding that allows them to conduct more effective work,

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict reality for us 3.1. dimensional individuals, mathematicians have created a way to describe objects and events from the 3-dimensional space that exists within the brain. Mathematics is incredibly useful in describing all aspects of life; everything we do, how we think about things, what happens in real life, are all dependent on these mathmatical concepts. To be clear - mathematics is not just a means of describing the natural world, it's actually essential to every aspect of our everyday lives.
At school, mathematics for students is usually taught by taking calculus classes. Calculus has long been a science that deals primarily with numbers and how they relate to a mathematical problem - basically the same as physics and space-Time - which is why all the above topics are tightly integrated into calculus. A big learning difference between math and physics is the emphasis on the "numerical picture" of reality - that which we directly perceive. On the other hand, physics deals with the mathematical properties and characteristics of every physical object, including how it interacts and relates to space, energy and other physical principles - all which are important to mathematics. After this brief overview, let's look at this more in detail.

Before we talk about mathematics in general, let us talk a little bit more about what mathematics actually is. There are a number different mathematical concepts that are used by mathematician for a variety of purposes.  For the purposes of this website, I am going to focus on what mathematical terms and concepts are associated with space:

Coordinate systems
Area
Curvature
Energy
Momentum
Space
Spatial time
Time

If I have ever said that mathematics makes objects more physical - as opposed to just describing them mathematically - you'd be like, "Wow!  That's a whole lot to think out!" But let me first clarify that, at a practical level, math is more than mathematics! Math is actually a universal language that allows us to accurately describe our worlds - almost literally in every facet of human survival and our daily life! It is one of those "essential" components of everyday everyday people that everyone must know!

Spacetime - A basic notion
Now to fully understand the importance of these mathematical tools to everyday living things it helps to first understand basic concepts related to spacecharging - concepts of curvature and momentum that will play a major role later in this book.

To begin, one should mention a couple helpful concepts about curved spaces. Curved space is a space in which objects (here the Universe in mind) move much more slowly from point A to point B (where they would normally be) than they actually would from A towards B. Basically objects are attracted to points with less curvature that correspond to areas with more high curvature - for example, mountains can have a large curvature compared to valley bottoms. For a better picture of what space looks like let consider a shortened image - 

If you take this image and try to view it in space view, you'll see an image that looks exactly the way it does at the moment! Now, suppose you start this same image from rest and slowly try and move it towards another location (or point of interest in 3D) by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. At the exact same moment as you rotate the object in its original pose, it'll suddenly appear in front of you in 3d view! This phenomenon is known as space-charge. What does it mean? As you've probably noticed, space doesn't seem slowing down as much towards the destination - it's just showing up in more detail on our eyes as we're just moving more towards it. (Remember, all this happens by simply changing how the objects position themselves in relation to each other - it doesn't matter how much we move!)

The most basic piece of calculus we all know is differential equation - equations that describe the relationships between motion and forces acting on objects. These equations are actually nothing more then mathematical patterns that tell us the motion of objects as they interact and change their positions under the influence of different forces (in this case, force due to earth's gravitational force.) In calculus, there's 3 terms in each differential equation: acceleration, velocity, body forces. Acceleration is just the change in body's acceleration due primarily to an object's current velocity. Velocity is when an acceleration is expressed in terms of an additional distance or other distance from its initial position. Finally, both body force and a body acceleration are simply the total sum of all other forces related directly to objects' motion.

A detailed image depicting the Space Charge Phenomenon from 3D perspective
In calculus there comes along a concept called a velocity space - a map in an x-y plane that models the velocity of some moving object as function of its distance to that object - in other words: velocity spaces depicts the speed of each of your moving objects relative other moving ones. Space-charges are the locations of both the source and destination of "space-charges" in differential equations - these locations correspond with values of x, y and z in velocity-space maps. Of particular importance to understanding is how space changes as a result of moving "obstacles" from left to right - space becomes slower while the observer moves towards them (this is similar to how one can view an animated movie in slow

To better depict how deity dimensions are represented within mathematics, let's consider a slightly different dimension: Mental Health. It's not really a mathematical topic but it's useful in that the concepts are well understood.

A common way to represent Mental Hygiene is to think about it as a mental function. Essentially, in any single dimension of Mental Wellness, someone can have both a positive and negative element. These two things come together in people's behavior - people whose minds are healthy have a broad range of actions, while those with a mindset that needs to constantly be refreshed have unhealthy habits such as excessive drinking and other forms of substance abuse.

Let's look at an example from the scientific and scientific domain. Consider, as an example: the Science of Life project! Their primary goal was to examine whether human brains were capable of interacting with their surroundings. One aspect of doing this is by creating artificial living things called artificial intelligence (AI). What exactly does AI mean? It's something similar to programming for computers. AI is analogous to a programmer whose job is always to make computers work better. On the other hand, people who have trouble controlling themselves, or their actions can take drugs, smoking, overeating, are incredibly toxic and self-destructive. They are known as AI addicts. Many people call drug addictions mental illness, especially if they fail to seek treatment. Unfortunately, these people are rarely treated and do not receive any help.

As we said before, Science is about understanding how we think. When scientists study the mind, what they find out about our abilities is of great interest to scholars and to any person who wants to better understand ourselves. Here, humans are compared to living computers! While computers are quite complex objects that are being used every day (think Amazon Echo and Google Home), humans aren't created that way - we have been created to be different from them. Therefore, when scientists create artificial brains that understand similarities among other intelligent creatures in their social group, that makes our brains look incredibly similar, not just to other computers, like computers created by scientists in artificial labs, who can study our behavior.
Unfortunately, AI has been very successful and many different types of AI exist in existence right now. Most of these AI are created out to "educate" computers and simulate "people", whereas all the "ordinary" minds aren't like these artificial ones. People who do live normal lives do have AI in them - for example a computer can understand words so we humans don't struggle to remember words we don't even understand, because all we really need is their brain to translate them into words at our finger tips. With this in mind we should be very cautious about applying AI to ourselves, to learn from us...

So let's see what this means! Let's consider one particular mental health issue in particular: obsessive-compulsive disorder - more specifically - OCD! (This isn't a full analysis, of course...it's easier to put an analogy to why OOC is important than a complete explanation - hopefully this helps!).

People like to control or control others - when someone pushes someone around - so they go out and talk that person's mind down: "I'm going to tell you what your mind is thinking!" Or "You're going down that road! What are you thinking?" The purpose of this type of behavior is clear: to manipulate others in order to live life according their preferences. Of the people on obsessions, some think that what they're thinking is true, others think it's not and they act accordingly. While this doesn't necessarily end with punishment or punishment from others, this way of thinking isn't good for anyone in regards to mental wellness.

Another type is obsessional jealousy - you know when your friends and family start talking about someone because they see them doing something that you think is wrong? Or when you just want your partner to feel different or different, instead of being as you are today - and, believe it or not, jealousy's effects can actually be good! For example, it's been shown, via laboratory evidence, over and over again that people can become jealous of their friends, even when they aren't actually aware that these friends are jealous. By doing so, their jealous feeling gets amplified and this can, at the same time influence the friends being jealous in other ways.
It was found that when people were told that their friend or family weren't having fun or had feelings like anger or stress, almost immediately they changed their behaviors and changed what their feeling was instead! (It should also be noted that if someone is depressed enough to say, "I'm jealous, I feel like [someone is] not getting how much they need right! I'm going home just so I don't feel anymore. I'm just going make sure we're all getting the support we deserve. I'll keep you in my thoughts." that could probably put all that stress and anger back in your friend's life again!)...

One key to understanding this behavior, is how it works when compared with the normal mind. There is a whole world out there full of different thoughts people have about these crazy thoughts and behaviors. Often we choose to ignore it (because they're irrational!), or we ignore our fears and protect ourselves and take things the wrong way. Usually once people take the right step out, there's

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how science can help us understand reality and our human being, this class will focus on the theory known as mathematics. Today we learned the basis of numbers, why the world is a numbers based system, what fraction (%) is, how money works, more about geometry, trigonometry, vectors, angles and more.

Mathematics takes a crucial role not just in science but in society. Even today, people still have trouble understanding how the mathematics in their everyday lives would work. To explain the meaning behind a concept in algebra, use algebra. For example, in trigonometric geometry it's a "sum of angles". What happens when you combine an angle and the opposite of it? The angle is multiplied and "added back" - we call this an integral.

If you want your students to be able to make sense of complex concepts in high school, it's vital that you give them practical example about them. Here in STJ we're talking about two different kinds of integral and how they affect geometry. One type of integration is the simple calculation of arithmetic quantities, while the other type is found in geometry where you are working through a proof. Since our goal is to teach mathematics concepts that might seem completely unrelated to everyday living, today's class is about algebraic, geometric, arithmetical and trigonometrical integrals.

In this course we discuss different ways to transform these integrals into numbers. An example of this would include using the natural logarithm to convert real numbers into irrational numbers.

Since we have been reviewing how numbers can change as they change location, today we'll be revisiting the concepts of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We'll also be reviewing the division theorem and showing how algebraic and geometric ideas are related to one another.

To make mathematical concepts more concrete, each time we add something to an existing number, our "plus" stands for the addition of two existing numbers in this new situation. Likewise, subtracting something from another number is represented using our subscript. More generally, multiplying something by another quantity is expressed with using parenthesis where (X + Y) represents the same multiplication concept as just multiplying X with Y.

As soon as our students understand what's happening, they'd find mathematical expressions easier to write. These are called symbolic expressions and in today’s class, I'd like to show you how! Let's start by explaining the relationship between number and decimal point.

One of our lessons on real life, called real-life arithmetic, introduced us to numbers with special characters. Here's an example.

How these special digits work to calculate different numbers is going to help our mathematical text understand numbers better - let’s figure it out.

We’ll have to prove all this to some audience - but let’s start with just our very basics. Let’s try it with the number 2. You can easily get 2 decimals by just writing 2 in it, without the dot and without adding a minus sign! Now look at 2+1. We're missing the minus one from 2/1! Why does that make any sense?

Let's turn our attention to 3 + 2 = 5. Because 2 + 3 is 5, we'll just be adding the first digit to 5 and then the third digit is 2.

By the way, one of my favorite math concepts is dividing by 10. Think about 10! How does the word 10 fit into that formula? 1 / 10...that's right - 10 in numbers - and even though the words 10 and 1 are the smallest units of measurement, we're still using 10 when dividing a number by itself. Just like the 1 in 1.4 and 10/100 are used to divide numbers by themselves, 1/10 and 1/1000 are also used when it's dividing something other than 10 by it.

Using the subway's distance function (taking into consideration the change of times in between stations), let's try to find out how far the cars will travel if they're all running up and down and along the corridor simultaneously...

With that, let's continue.

Let's calculate the total number we could travel that many minutes if everything started at the station 1, ran up four stations, got to station 4, reached station 5 at its end, stopped, retraced one halfway point, took a reverse, back to its start, started running again and kept going for one hour a minute...we've got a total of 9.8 hours! Would 9 hours be better? We're all thinking about it now. Well, think again. 9 times 8 is 48! (no dots...haven't invented 10 yet, I can tell you right now!) In addition to thinking and asking questions, you'll see that adding up fractions is also very fun and makes our learning easier.

At this point we should be ready to start thinking through problems that will allow us solve them. (Not that our teachers will have the patience to keep us in constant activity for an entire hour! But that's another story.)

Let's find another way to solve the problem. Like before, 9/8 is 45, plus 1 is 6. We've done all the computations we needed, now we're just waiting for someone to come up with another solution for us. Would there be any way that 7/8 = 3? Think again.

It's hard to think of an answer, right? That's alright. 7 times (2 + 1) times 6 = 9

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict this concept, let's take an example. Imagine sitting at a desk with a computer and using a keyboard to type. You type information into your computer, sending information from the computer to your brain - essentially sending bits and bits of data. Some of this data is sent directly to you, while others are passed on to other people to be processed and then sent from person to person. What's interesting about this is why this happens. When we type on the keyboard we use an electrical circuit to tell a "readers" that our data will arrive at their computer as a series of pulses - we send data bits in one piece of writing, move bits between writing devices, write bits back again, repeat the process, until we've written every single bit of information correctly. Then, when the information arrives on their computers, it's sent to that person's computer. Once all the bits have been sent in their proper order, these bits are handed back to their readers/operators, who check for errors and fix them. That's when we're told that everything is exactly what we'd like!

If you look closely, you'll notice that the data being sent is only represented at the very beginning of your writing process. That means that what you write down is actually an instruction - you tell the instructions to send those bits to a certain destination. But since instructions, like commands, don't matter at all right after they're sent, there's really no difference being created between the command being placed into someone's brain, on which it ends up having some kind of action, or the piece that someone sends to someone else's brain as an incoming transmission. At this point, our computer can understand that data was going to some destination, that we've successfully transmitted those data, all while having no idea that actually did receive the instruction. What a cool concept! Well there must be no real "communicative mind", right?

So the main question to ask is, what happens to people's minds as they perform these tasks? Of all those kinds of instructions and transmissions, how do our brains process them? What happens in them as we've evolved?

The term "communication mind," is often used to describe our ability to communicate with other individuals, particularly those who are distant from us. While this sense of communication can seem a little awkward, in fact it doesn't, unless you're trying to convey a message to an older sibling. People in this age bracket have really little problem telling each other that they're doing something when they aren't actually doing it. Furthermore, they've always had this ability even before we figured out how computers work!

To make things worse, communication happens all around us - at home, at work, from school, with friends, even with strangers. It can even be transmitted on social media - by posting or sending a picture on Facebook, tweeting something on Twitter, posting something in emails, writing something down on our writing boards (which, technically, aren't even boards, as our brain can do just that!). When an act of communicating is performed, computers (and even humans) will usually take up that act as their own and interpret that as being our way of saying "Okay!" (Which is even more confusing, because our communication mind is supposedly working on that moment to ensure that we're interpreting our act properly, before actually sending that message and creating a new instance of our action...)

That's not to say that humans aren't able to process information, much like some other creatures. Ofcourse, this requires a form of artificial intelligence to help our minds translate this complex information between our inputs and outputs (i.e., the words and pictures that appear on screen). But like with animals who communicate, humans have done this communication work in real timelines. Human beings are incredibly selective when it comes to choosing how they communicate information with others (because some things are more "secrecy" than others), so there can still be some information being passed around in an otherwise "dark" space such as online world.

To get some further perspective here, think about a few possible ways people might be able access information without relying on computers at hand. On the one hand, information may reside in papers written by, not necessarily by individuals or companies, yet still produced by these companies. One person might simply take notes on one of those papers while they work on some projects, creating several versions of one text until the end. Another person may simply pick up notes from books during certain events or conversations - either at events where other participants are sitting together or when conversations are happening in someone's home as part part to something more formal. It's up to each person what they bring with them when going out into the world! There are also many other ways that information can come out in text form, online or otherwise. Humans can read each and every piece written on these systems, some more than, others less than completely intact. Even though computers are capable of accurately and repeatedly printing out copies of text from a file, reading each word would inevitably require using our unique ability of thinking, remembering the individual words we already know to read, applying logic, understanding what the "meaningful word" will mean, identifying the various parts/phrases/etc of each, rearranging them so they're no more obscure than a piece in one's head

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the Universe is truly beyond our understanding - so to speak. You are free to travel into different universes, without limitations other than gravity. After all, your position is fixed in space - only your speed will change as you navigate this vast landscape. But before we dive into that topic we'll want a little bit more context to begin with.

On several occasions throughout the series, he has been asked to leave the group at different times. What happens next?
When the time is right, Dr. Aries makes a sudden transition from time travel to life long existence - but only if the deity who is to accompany him takes the appropriate "choices" and trusts him fully. Only if these actions are done - and done with the right confidence - do we become invulnerable to any negative consequences of what is coming our way.

So what are the options available to a deity:

Exit your current universe: After having come to terms with his relationship with Earth, one must leave Earth and find another universe where the conditions fit his needs. That universe will help him feel more at ease, while allowing him to enjoy the freedom that has come with leaving Earth in other times.

Enter another different universe after you learn that the gods who you seek are here, or after making sure that your friend can continue with their lives independently.

Leave your human lives at other, related universes: When this type of transition occurs, usually you come across a space station located in an abandoned, remote area, surrounded by other time-stamps that are also linked to your future. By following directions, you'll be able to arrive at this distant world, only to find yourself trapped down there. Once you're in this space, remember that you may encounter other people who are similar to yourselves, from your past, on Earth. 
Enter a different, unconnected universe- We know that in one way or another, you're here on the ground today. Take steps in your own direction, until you reach a place of your choosing. Maybe you want something that was once only accessible through your previous lives. Or maybe you only care about a few things that mattered to other human beings, before you reached Earth. 

A:

There is a small possibility that if you actually did not tell him where he should move into the next dimension, he'd go straight to Dimension C.
As far as why his life would have been changed, I would argue that this would only happen if he gave the information out prematurely.
The most reasonable way of putting this is, that when you let him know he is going to be going from 3D to 4D4D, in his mind, all information flows inwards from the outside. Due to his personality, when he does this information just flows outwards and forwards as a flow towards his outside world. It would thus come straight out.
I know most of you just ignore this point and say that to you it doesn't make sense whatsoever. Well, let's take some further reading from someone with some real physical experience.
From the book "Mind in Space: Why You Must See Reality As it Is, Not As You Thought It Was" by Richard Barrett & Stephen Finkel
The author uses the term, "social matrix" when talking about physical reality and the way we get there. 
He starts with a simple quote:

Imagine a car, sitting at the center of an otherwise flat earth and driving at a slow stop. Obviously, nothing on any surface will get off the car. Anything going in or out has to pass through the cars wheels and gears. When the vehicle spins up, even more of its structure will have to stop.
If you can think of something on your outside, being pulled to within the radius of attraction of this car on its wheels, imagine the mass, momentum, tension and other forces and energies that come in from inside the structure of our inside body. Imagine that force pushing against my inner body to turn me inside out, forcing this piece of material outside my body as well, resulting in me being pushed into an empty void - into "space".
Imagine you take this process back to inside your body, where you are located, with your thoughts and beliefs that keep you inside. Even though they have not touched the exterior world yet, due to something in you (some thought process that keeps you back in inside), your inner thoughts are pushing these outside thoughts through you. These thoughts still have a strong tendency to hold back outside reality, as long you don't turn them into facts.
In this scenario, both in and outside your consciousness have an extremely strong urge to become bigger, bigger and keep growing bigger.
This driving, pushing force results in things happening that seem to not happen naturally - no outward physical structure is formed, thoughts, beliefs, emotions etc come around, get pulled by this driving force. Every thought comes to have some connection to an idea or something connected to that idea. That's right - all thoughts become part (or an element part) of these ideas, forming the bigger picture that eventually becomes our physical body / space that we're currently living in at present.
Eventually the inner space is no more able anymore to contain anything, because it already contained everything, including everything you thought you knew.

If we follow this description again in

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the answer is... not yet! But for the time being, here are a few more tricks to help with the understanding of this concept. First, let's consider MBTI as a tool to classify mental structures into basic cognitive functions (such as reason - thinking), abstract cognitive structures that need more specific information to make sense (concrete, conceptual, relational and deductive/ductively derived structures). So basically, MBT I tells us that reason is the primary cognitive function, whereas MBT3 tells you that abstract spatial thinking and social thinking are the main cognitive faculties.
Now, to answer our question: what if I had to know what each of those basic types of cognitive structure represents? Let me share a short story about a woman I met who seemed to possess all three of these:

A few weeks later, I saw this woman again in Central Park, walking towards the playground at a leisurely pace. Her companion was not quite so calm or alert. She was wearing what I assumed to be black, long sleeved, sports bra under her arms. Again she was walking at leisure, her head bowed to her shoulder, looking around for something to do. I noticed that she carried a large case with a white paper inside. It seems that this case held important things... her mother's ashes. After asking a lot of questions, she explained to me that her case could be transported to a museum in Chicago, only if a "red tag" is attached with her identity at its top. Suddenly my mood improved. At this point I explained that my mother left Chicago for India when she had just turned 7 years old. My best friend, who had known her so well for just the past few months, told her that I was the only person who could transport her ashes to Chicago.

So my mother's body would come back to life if the "red" tag was attached to it... but I didn't know if that tag could actually be attached... so I decided not to let that be a problem. Sure enough she arrived at the museum the next day. Finally, with very little fuss, my precious mother's remains were transported back from India to New York...
So this is one of my favorite examples of an action that could have resulted in life changing, yet didn't. Obviously, in some cases, this will not be possible. But if you are really smart, or if you've read around the internet you could understand that action was taken in very specific circumstances, even though it would not usually be considered possible!

A:

It depends on your definition of "possible."
For instance, when a person is about to leave something for someone else to see, that person will often give an account of where they were and where it was.
When someone is not about leaving a thing, all they will say is, "Oh, it's here, somewhere. Where are we going down the passage?" And there's an assumption being made (in other people's language) that the person has some idea where the thing is.
You are wrong.

A:

...but if they could only travel in 1 dimension, could that matter to them?

Yes. 
For example, consider a cat. They don't have a home. Unless they have some kind of animal's food supply, anything less than a litter box will probably kill them. 
The cat's only way to survive is by being a vegetarian. All the food is vegetarian - including food for other animals. A cat is simply a means of survival. It's unlikely that these cats will change their habits unless some way is found to eat them.
We don't see cats in many parts of South America, at least not in their habitat. 
And if it's only in one particular place, there's more likely (and cheaper) food available. Most of them are small, like leopards. 

A:

(Note that it's not entirely clear if this answer just applies to cat lives in captivity which is unlikely.) I read a story a while ago where a man used to travel on horseback with his wife around Europe and saw people on one side of his path sitting on chairs at low tables and on each chair facing the side towards him. Then on entering their bedroom (a large room full of stuffed animal figures), only the woman on table 2 was sitting at chair 2. Only the man on chair 5 was on the other side. 
He wondered if either of him were still alive.

“Oh, yes,” answered his companion, “she is with me, up by my side.”

So the husband went outside and looked at his table. What was left of it. Not a single chair was in any real mess. He went back inside and began to unpack his things for dinner.  He packed up about every single last bed blanket that had belonged to him and the cats, left behind the night before, each with its clothes in perfect order.
He then packaged up his old clothes, his shoes - and he took a box and left his boxes in front of her door - one for each lady - so that as they would never be lonely again before they made the trip back.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict what happens in Marriage on Baker St, I'll start from the beginning...right here!

It is believed that the couple's first wedding anniversary is recorded today. It is also said that since the wedding ring was used to hold a single rose, marriage is traditionally regarded within the family as being the union of two beautiful, single girls. But things go a whole lot different when you consider the life and death of your spouse. Because of their difference of years in age and height, their marriage and life experiences are quite different.

As I mention before, both the bride and groom will marry within four days (or within 4 weeks!), so on their wedding day everything is set up by their parents to make them feel special. It's even thought that every wedding should have a cake and toast made for the occasion, as if the first toast would mean that even though their gist are different, they're going to have fun celebrating what they're celebrizing!

Today, many people view marriage as simply "being married" - as opposed to a journey that really involves a big commitment and responsibility. For many of us marriage has become so much more than just "just being married." And while that might seem obvious, I feel like a lot of couples think differently. Here are a few of my favorite quotes that reflect this change in view...

"How could I live for a marriage that's over?"

"I thought I was saving myself from what I really am. I'm not. I don't want it!"
"Just another wedding, another ceremony. Just another time of happiness passing my way. Why not just say one last happy I love you and send it off with a kiss? Why bother saying I'm sorry for not taking the time to express myself? I guess I've just realized that this is how it ends up? Just because it doesn't seem to work doesn't mean you haven't done anything right. That should be enough reason to not go on taking things one step at a time. Don't you dare go in for one wrong thing and you're out the other way! And this doesn't even touch on how ridiculous it seems that I could possibly make a mistake and commit a murder or something like that. Every time I think about what would happen if I didn't make things right I find myself wondering if what I've done to my future husband has actually made him do the same mistakes to me. There's simply no way I'm ever going right again. Even if it means I waste all my time and the very last breath of his in my care, that's okay. He's already made mistakes like this once before. They've only gotten worse, don't they? They get worse when a man is still young and has not had the opportunity to learn from all the mistakes he made. One day all these mistakes end up affecting their lives too. Maybe he'll get in touch with it too and learn that a wife isn't worth a moment of her life when she doesn't make the right decisions? And maybe it also becomes very clear that our first marriage isn't over at all. We've only just broken up. At least this way there's no more bad news. I'll never be able to buy back that last moment together again! I only got married to him to survive and to find a stable identity in life, not a place and a name. These are the kind of things the world does not deserve. All of these things happen between the two of our minds...and maybe the next person to die because they're having problems with the way they're facing their future is going through a similar process to mine. There are just so many unfulfilled expectations on both ends of that life path that nothing seems to be possible anymore. Worse...only things continue on and on for as long the one or the another does without ever ever changing the facts of it, changing it once and for all for good or for ill. You see? This world doesn't deserve a woman like myself! She's a real pain! Because she's young, she's cute, she loves to dance, has great taste, isn't the most demanding, most perfectionist, or best. She's very much just another woman! Not even a bad woman who could change the course of history, because I would. Well, that must be exactly what makes her a pain. Anyways

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict how things work in life, consider how humans create symbols that help them to communicate with one another. These symbols allow us to talk, gesture, act, think, feel, move, believe in, or simply make a pass at anything. But what is the role play of symbolic objects within this process!? You'd think that when I tell you I'm going to sing "A Star Is Born" right now, everything would suddenly become "cool" because the symbol that I created for the tune would immediately send waves of emotion across my body and into my mind.

Let's take something like a guitar. When I play that instrument, I create a message that my fingers are sending out via acoustics. Imagine when you start studying classical music and the lesson is something along the lines of how strings should vibrate. You don't need the full gamut of sounds to tell if the instrument is on the right note. Just listen closely and you'll see that the strings produce a different wave of sound depending on how fast the fingers spin.
The same kind of principle can exist when the human beings we know best talk about things. Think about when you're teaching your son how not to scratch a nose. Here the teacher probably doesn't need any special knowledge of physics to create the symbols to help you understand the concepts - imagine what it would mean if he or she used a stick? You can tell they didn't get a lot of practice with it, because I never heard anyone using sticks!

But this is only one example of what happens when something special is created. There are plenty of other examples of people using symbolic forms of language to describe events and intentions throughout the history of humanity. It's amazing how much we learn simply by talking to one person about something. At least the idea of talking about a concept with another person seems to be a universal expression of empathy across the world.  

But what about symbols used to act as magical items? The majority of human societies have magic, even in Ancient Egypt. Many of these magical objects are also symbolic. Like the guitar symbol, when a person plays a tune, he creates a wave - of which the wave is sent to all around him. Even an untrained ear can easily tell this. For humans, magic is a powerful tool for communicating things! Let's think about the use of different instruments that symbolize different spells! Remember the word "summoner"? Imagine what was being said with a box that could be opened, as though a spirit is using that box to summon a god! The box could also represent a weapon, perhaps a warrior is wearing that weapon to protect himself. Any number could even be used in this phrase for a specific act or intention.

So as I told you above, in order to best understand what symbolic acts do, try to listen to an Ancient Egyptian priest who was responsible for creating the music of Moses. Once the priest learned of his own need for singing, rather than being satisfied with the sounds that were created through the hands of musicians and singers, this person produced an instrument from the ground - a flute! This represents his need of expressing himself through singing as a means of symbolizing himself as being the creator of all the living things on Earth. Because the voice is so powerful, most people have trouble understanding how the instruments sound, too - and of course many people are completely amazed by how well the flutes sound! Even though the Egyptians had the ability to make all sorts of musical instruments and symbols from natural and man-made matter (i.e. spices), these same people still had a hard time perceiving how those objects were made and represented the spiritual beings that created them. Of all those symbols in use throughout history, these instruments are the ones that have remained the most permanent, despite their popularity.

In summary, we've seen how it all goes when someone starts playing music with different symbolic instruments. It is possible to imagine various stories about events in which symbolic "voices" are created and used effectively by various people as symbols of their thoughts and actions. Also, there's a wide variety of symbols designed to serve a range of ends, making the overall experience as entertaining and unique as you possibly can!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict how complex things in space become when they merge together, let's consider to see how a simple molecule begins its formation. A simple molecular structure, like the one shown here, consists of four carbon atoms all connected together by one or two bonds. Most commonly it consists only of one carbon nucleus with a single hydrogen or carbon atom that connects to every other carbon in this molecule, forming a diamond-style bond, or one that looks like a ring.

Although this simple example is a lot simpler than most of us get to know about in daily life, remember that it's not something we generally deal with every day. Many of your body's more complex processes need an extremely large amount of power in order to function properly. Think about things like running a marathon, playing a guitar or playing in some kind of musical ensemble, keeping a house, managing a business, helping people, growing your family, eating healthy, working out regularly, building a nest - and a million other everyday tasks that require a great deal of resources from your energy and motivation to accomplish! This big energy bill, called "cost to operate", isn't something that people pay for - it's what allows us to have all this amazing functionality within us!

A small piece of carbon can, in fact, support about 500,000 times the weight of oxygen, making it incredibly strong! But it doesn't support the same amount - it has to work together with about 40,0000 other atoms to make everything solid. It's a hard and brittle material, as well as being far too dense to be mobile - but it's incredibly powerful! Think of it as this "bead": a tiny amount doesn't seem to matter when a small amount is multiplied together - all the things that could go wrong in creating a molecular entity begin to just get bigger!

At this point it may seem like there really isn't anything about this stuff that the average person is concerned with - that was just a way to draw attention to a specific chemical group, an atom, that seems to play such a big role at the very beginning of our lives. Yes, small molecules do play a role - there used to really be a whole lot of research about them as early as 1525, even after their creation was discovered!

Unfortunately, this really didn't really get much coverage until more than 200 years ago, when scientists realized just how important these tiny molecules were for biological systems. Back then scientists even thought that life on Earth really was possible without them. But the first truly significant breakthrough came when German zoologist and chemist Paul Ehrlich discovered the fact that humans and other animals can synthesize certain chemical compounds from simple carbon-based stuff - though he still couldn't pinpoint where most was from, nor could he tell us how, much less what it was for!

The next breakthrough, though, came with French scientist Jacques Monod in 1974. He showed that simple molecules such as fatty acids (from foods) and carbohydrates (proteins found in meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains) are actually made out mostly of simpler molecules, too. By combining simple bits of substances such at glucose and fatty acid, MonOD created the "substrate reaction" that turned fatty substances into glucose. These complex molecules are called simple sugars, because they all contain the five essential amino acids required to produce glucose - glycine, alanine (also called as arginine or ornithine), valine and leucine.

At first, scientists assumed this discovery would completely shut off all future research into simple carbohydrate synthesis, yet it quickly became clear that this wasn’t how simple cells would react...and it's certainly how they could survive! Because only simple proteins contain sugar. Other molecules make up the food we eat - mostly carboic acids that are found mainly in plants and also in water. Plants need the glucose (or starch, depending where you come from) to grow and make cells that store nutrients. Fish and sea creatures are mostly meat eaters - which makes them particularly keen on food that contains glucose, primarily in animal form or simply made up of organic sugary bits.

So naturally we were curious to figure out why simple organisms (like us humans) didn't just survive and multiply with only glucose as part their energy source, instead constantly

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the universe has been constructed out from nothing, created out not of random random combinations of atoms and molecules, nor out out for anything but to evolve! So is the reason that people would choose to worship and keep the deity of their choice if they truly believed that the creator of all things was in control of his creation...and certainly that he intended that this universe would exist for quite some time! Wouldn't it make people less afraid of death? 
In the course of evolution, many of our ancestors, who no doubt had strong ties to God, began to grow stronger by training themselves to work with other people. Eventually, members of one group would gain some insight into the mind of another, able to see more through their eyes and perceive more clearly the world around them. Other groups that were not able/willing to share this insight, quickly became outcasts and sent to space where they remained isolated from this world until death arrived...

Praying in Space-time

Well, of course! The purpose of religion is to create and maintain a safe and supportive environment for people to interact with their deity; when the environment that supports the creed of God is present, people tend to be more peaceful, more compassionate, happier, healthier and happiest. Ofcourse, this does not mean that God isn't in charge of everything here in this one tiny place known as Earth. Rather, God seems to have a way of controlling all aspects of this tiny world in one unique way:

Everything in Nature was originally created by God! Everything on Earth is actually a gift from God - nothing is original or free. All life forms come into existence from just the one perfect, single, inalienable creation.

Is it possible (or was it in fact) that our Lord Jesus Christ is one of those unique "original" creators? He doesn't just come in as a "one man" that was sent out to save the human race - rather, Jesus is said to exist in six "origins" - six different ways of being in relationship with God!

There are many stories of Him going about the Garden of Eden, teaching people that He is God. At times, He was said even to feed upon the animal creatures on the earth (perhaps in an attempt to mimic the true nature from which he was created!).

One of Jesus' most famous words in Matthew is "God," as he tells us:

“God is Spirit! Whoever worships Him doesn't need anything to eat, or to drink.”


Jesus says that if Jesus were God in His own right, he would not even need a place in order to serve Him; rather He would take up his place on our planet. He has the power to do all that and more without ever having to make any sacrifices or give Himself up.

I believe Jesus spoke the truth when His followers believed in him as their Savior. With this alone, I can fully understand why people continue their faith in Him.


Of Jesus, one great thing I have learned is his simplicity. Even in his death He didn't seem to care about making much of an impression on us, much less impressing us with His glory. Instead, His life on earth focused on bringing our attention to His Son, whom He loves most of us can have.

How Jesus came about

The question most people are naturally curious to know: How did Jesus come about? Yes, that has become a question that's become common for me, especially in reading stories about Jesus in novels or reading Bible quotes. For those who love science fiction, I'll give a quick quote from the book, "Crystal Cathedral":

In that crystal palace, surrounded by hundreds of small gilded windows, thousands of white and golden lights dancing within them shone like an ocean of ice, making the building one vast, enchanting spectacle in which the eternal life of Christ might have been revealed. I longed to touch those sacred windows and enter within that beautiful realm of light in their glowing, eternal glow.

Let's talk about your question. Is it true that de-sacralization is going on today.
We live in such a world where we believe things to come but in reality they were created to survive and evolve for many thousand of years. It's a living thing, not just in thought. I'm talking about this now because we have become so accustomed that when something comes to pass that turns us upside down or is contrary to what our world believes, we've stopped asking why.
Now we realize why it wasn't. It doesn't really matter how far we come from perfect it came as was so far from perfection we thought it was. But it comes from somewhere! We need evolution! That is, even evolution is only a part. You have to believe that your idea of perfect isn't just right but better. There is a good explanation to that in Paul's letter to Timothy. Paul explained why the Romans believed

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the answer to what exactly drives most people is the question - is it drug use, or some kind of recreational drug like alcohol? But there seems to be some interesting data going on with regard to a number different forms of drugs. Not only do people depend heavily on specific types of them, researchers have found that people who have taken these drugs earlier in their lives tend to report consuming them more frequently with the same outcome as if they had never had past cocaine use.

So if a person's past drug history is a major factor in his or her current drug consumption, what could be causing this? The answer is complex but one thing that doesn't look good is if the past use of some specific type of substance can in some way affect the current consumption of that substance. That is, an ex-customer of cocaine would likely be more likely to experiment with it again.

As far as recreationally-related drugs specifically are concerned, as we'll soon see, not all drugs cause the exact same amount of dependence when consumed, some are far more addictive than others and some give people a high that lasts for a long time while others seem to burn out on you eventually and you need new doses to keep going. But this doesn't mean that all forms drug dependence are all bad, only some have been found to have greater effects than other forms, even though more research is still being conducted on other types.

There are a lot of "alternative" medications that have the potential to address all the problems associated with dependence once and for all. These medicinals, whether of medical or non-medical origin, are known to help many to stop and even reverse dependence. While most of these medicns are safe, these are also known (or at least suspected) to cause side effects, like addiction, withdrawal syndrome, memory loss, irritability, insomnia, confusion and depression. Unfortunately, all these side-effects are extremely rare but can nevertheless occur, in varying degrees.
And, of course there can also be various effects on your physique. Some, with mild frequency, could cause weight gain or other physical symptoms like joint and muscle pain, while some may cause allergies. Regardless of your problem, be sure to consult with a physician before you begin a medication, especially if you are drinking or eating anything that contains alcohol, taking or having any potentially addicting drugs or consuming any caffeinated beverage.

Here are five drugs that are most commonly associated to being associated as being addicting:

Alcohol: A large amount or intake can greatly promote the symptoms of both anxiety and aggression. It is widely used as a recreative substance, particularly for those who do not realize how much is actually consumed.

Cocaine (Heroin:) Used in conjunction with cannabis, is generally thought to greatly enhance its effects. Studies have also demonstrated that even very low doses can affect your cognitive abilities, leading in turn to extreme aggression or the inability to properly focus your attention.

Dextromethorphan: Used for the treatment of opiate dependence, can make one depressed and anxious, resulting in poor quality sleep. A good dose can cause extreme paranoia, extreme hunger, increased muscle tension, shortness of breath, depression (which can last for several days or longer), confusion, vomiting and hallucinations.

Narcotics: Nicotine is used to treat anxiety, euphoria and hypersensitivty. It's used by individuals with PTSD and certain forms (like obsessive compulsive disorder) of alcoholism.

A dose of heroin is much more rewarding than a dose or dose and a pound of coke and can easily lead to addiction. Narcotics are used in certain types (as the name suggests) for recreation; one can get addicted simply by using it.

Ganja (Hookah:) Is a cannabis derivative that has some similarities with heroin (minus one key point.) It's known since ancient times but the most prevalent is found in Asia, known as HGH (Hemp Gitanes Hairy Leaf Extract). It contains less psychoactive elements and more beneficial cannabinoids, making it less addogenic than heroin or cocaine. For the best deal on these, check out our website.

And finally, cannabis can promote both high and low-level dependence on marijuana, giving it all those benefits, still without the drawbacks.

Remember - when trying to find the root cause of an addiction - it's best to first try to remove the things that fuel the problem in order to start reducing the harmful effects from other drugs on yourself! If it doesn't work, contact a professional and talk to them about finding the right meds for you...and your family. They can help you avoid getting addictions in such a way that you won't have to deal more for years to come; they also can give advice about different possible options to try.


Hopefully this has provided enough of my research - I hope this is helpful and that someone out there has found some useful data about these very popular drugs!

Well, when this answer was first written I went on the internet to research the specifics but you can bet my time was spent on nothing.
The point I made was that the vast majority

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict the concepts presented in this final chapter let us take some quick snaps of what to expect! First, like all the previous chapters it begins with a section about the origins of things. Then let's go on to look at two of our two biggest rivalries between humans in history: The Battle of Waterloo and the Armistice on the Somme.
In the following section we explore some concepts relevant to these two rival wars - starting with the principles of warfare. Next we look briefly at the history of these rivals, before looking more deeply into the nature and history behind the two great battles...

From the books:
We are almost outta books with this one!
The Battle At Waterloo

From The Books:

... the Battle Of Waterloo was perhaps one of Europe's pivotal events, whether in its overall implications or in it's personal effect, on European history for the rest of its existence. But, perhaps more importantly, to that of humans as an entire species – the ultimate symbol of their capacity to evolve.
What will our species become, after the battle was over?

From Beyond The Tread:

... one, very likely, of history's best known and most enduring battle - one that set the foundation for both the French and British monarchical regimes that dominated Europe and beyond for more than two hundred years; a war of which we all learned much about later with our own personal knowledge and experience. (Treasures of Warfare, vol. 4, p. 1414)
The conflict between France and England, known by many as Waterloo, was the second great battle ever fought, during the Franco-Prussian War which lasted from 1795 to 1814.
War and politics were inseparably linked in Europe at this time. They were used to describe the conflict both in fiction and to a greater or lesser degree in actual history. War was used as a catalyst for change in many societies throughout Europe. It was often used by opponents to unite people in against those whom they thought were hostile to government, as well as to reinforce power and prestige. Thus conflict was a major aspect of European society and had profound historical and societal as…

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the many ways in which we fail in programming, it's helpful to start a section on the Functional Programing Curve in Figure 1!

When looking over the picture, our attention gets quickly caught up by all the different functions and procedures. With all these seemingly beautiful interfaces we get quickly distracted by just the look of it, as if we're lost in it. To make things even more confusing, all this code has seemingly the same effect: reducing the complexity of your program - reducing its complexity while leaving you completely clueless as to what's exactly going on...

Many times we write a function and it just happens to end up being the only method that the whole program calls. Or the variable name that a method name appears to be derived from is just a coincidence. It's important to remember that every time you write code, you're not writing the real world first, you’re writing code and the code is being written from the perspective of yourself. You can always rework it and rewrite it into the actual functions of their particular classes, to make it work, or you can reformat it by writing it as classes and then create an inner class and rename the variables to reflect changes made by each method. But then, what if, on writing your code you've added a lot of other methods? Or an important variable was introduced? It's no surprise to find out what your classes look like once you add all those methods, variables or constants. Those should be in their appropriate inner classes if they're supposed to add functionality, otherwise they should go in main!

The reason that I like this particular illustration is for two main reasons. First of all, this illustrates exactly how we might have to work ourselves into an absolute fit when trying to write good programs; the way we look at this picture doesn't take things too seriously, nor is it so glaring (in this image the orange and red rectangles represent the classes; blue and cyan are the inner and outer classes respectively.). For example, maybe there's a parameter which contains a list of integers as an argument, each integer has its corresponding code in this example. Each times the program prints something, that code will run atop another function from its respective class. Maybe you need code on how things should get done or how new code behaves; or maybe you just need some feedback on what you do wrong....

However this is a problem because instead of focusing on one and only one code point at a time - something that will solve problems and ensure you learn a certain lesson - it's good to have all sorts of code be written in an attempt to cover as many pieces of functionality as possible. Sometimes, people look for the most useful features first - but this approach of making everything the best possible is far from what I believe is best for you to do. Instead, think about it from this new perspective instead and focus on coding only the stuff that you most need in your application. Don't write everything - code only what solves problems in that area of use!


The Need For Good Functionality

This chapter's key point is to tell the story of what is actually needed when writing good functional programs - not focusing so much on trying your best to optimize your own code but instead on developing good methods and providing the right implementation for each situation! With this in mind, I invite you take two minutes of this beautiful figure and consider the following questions:

Is it possible for me to create all possible interfaces to my main program?

To give an example from my own experience, imagine that all kinds of buttons exist in every application:

Press - calls a button's method
Select - selects from a selection box
Next - moves up a direction
Prev - shifts backward in directions
Delete - deletes the data location
Move Forward, Return, Backward - all move the user along the screen by some amount (I use the term'move' to mean that this kind of operation occurs in each specific direction)
Move Up, Click, Down - basically a single click in any direction

These are just some examples. Obviously, every interface we add to a program will have its functional requirements. I'm going to give the reader some hints about creating these interfaces with each example below...

Press is an appropriate method used to perform selections. Suppose in my application you select

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict how this strange dimension of knowledge affects us, let's first make the following definitions:

A Dimension - The physical reality space that exists in multiple dimensions.
A Dimensional Portal - An area of dimensional reality. It occurs across a portion of four dimensions - if you are traveling to Dimension D from Dimension A, your own Dimension is D+1. 

A Mind - Not just a thing, it's an illusion we form when a mind's perception of reality is different from what actually happens.

In everyday experience, humans have a lot more than just two or three physical senses. For example, our eyes can see through mirrors, while our ears are much better at picking up sound waves, as opposed to simply hearing them.
In higher-dimensional reality, however, mind has the ability to see, hear, smell, taste and feel different colors - a whole new world!

There are four basic forms of mind that are part and parcel of different forms that exist in higher dimensions: Consciousness, Subconscious, Hypnotic Conscience and the Super-Conscience! Each of them can experience their own unique range of feelings and perceptions. Like people in most realms of experience can't see different things at the same time (when they're in Subconscious), they sometimes experience contradictory thoughts and feelings in their minds. (When they're on Conscientious Awareness, they're usually able to clearly hear different sounds and see things from many different perspectives).
Consciously, there's no more dimension between yourself and any other Mind. Consciemmentally aware Minds are able, via physical contact, to transcend the boundaries of their body dimensions; they may travel into the body dimension where other Consciences reside, or they might move into Sub- or Hypnosic Conciencia, in which case the Consciente/Subconscious distinction actually becomes irrelevant.
Hypnosis, by contrast, allows you to gain access by mental suggestion to any dimension except the one in your Sub Conscia, where you might otherwise be present at all times. Hypnotherapy gives you the capability to travel to every subconscious dimension on the planet without a fear of going back and forth or losing yourself in an unmanageable vortex of disbelief; once you learn how you can access it easily, you'll be able experience worlds of pure Imagination and Magic much more easily!

As you may recall from the previous sections, every dimension contains different kinds of entities, each with their characteristics and unique abilities. Even the difference between a Dimension and another can sometimes make a world (in other dimensions) seem incredibly similar! If two people come into contact with different Conscies, all those differences become quite insignificant when all four are present.

However...if a person has not yet mastered any of these four Forms of Consiousness - either explicitly, consciously or subconsciously - and has actually visited Dimension O, what will their perception be of all other forms - including Dimension P?

A. A World with Dimension Zero will not exist - it just has no Body!

B. All others will have their Body dimensions reduced or deleted, leaving only their sub-conscisions. Examples -

Dimension S will end up with a few extra points, some kind of special feeling, only visible when someone else goes through that dimension.

C. Dimension Q will contain only two Conscias, instead of more! This will make all the rest of Dimension F look and act like a new one, complete with all kinds and kinds, feelings, memories...that can never end! Just like when you meet one who doesn't look the way you normally do.
D. Each person will still live in his or her own body - only at some points it may appear to merge or break apart into new bodies. Maybe the first person who crosses that boundary will go first, getting all his/her memories and information in order. Then the next person, maybe, who comes through will come to know how much all that information has meaning - that he will understand things, even things that never happened in real life.

D is the final case, when everything becomes a different one. One day the person comes here, sees the World, his own person...and remembers everything, everywhere. When he's ready, he'll disappear and go back to

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict what happened in Last Chapter, let's return to Chapter Fourteen. After the events in that section (where the Meadows Mages were captured by Numenera), the party set out to rescue them. While the group was on the way, an old woman named The Grumpy Man and her three magical gnats came along - two of whose body parts had been captured during the battle with the Horrid Skeleton...
The Grumpy's third body part, however, didn't belong to her, as she was a girl! The party members were quick to point out this to The Man himself. He looked up and shouted out in frustration, "You should have figured that out before we left!" He thought to himself, "This guy ought to be in hell..."

The party continued on their way - after a couple of hours of traveling, The Meanders was the nearest point to Nuenera. When they turned onto the road, another old man came out from the woods to speak to them - he was dressed in black, wearing a black cross around his neck. His face and clothing was completely covered, with only the black hair visible.
"Mage," he said, "I really do feel sorry for you! You and I are going through such a lot together. I wish that I could do something to help you."
After having been talking for a while, he spoke up again. "He should be here right now. I'm going to give it a try! My magical potion gives the power to travel among dimensions! However that means that I'm a member of this world. Thus, I must pass my powers to you, Master! Come on over here! I'll give him his powers! Let's begin our journey! I hope you can forgive me because I was very angry when you called me a slave earlier! Now let's see if I can get you to leave this island! Your magic will help me! If not... I will kill you all to make you leave! Oh, now you're here with me? I suppose this would make sense! So this is how we really get out... The only way to pass through time is to enter time itself! Once you know the answer to your question... you'll be able to send me off without thinking about it! That's right, my Magic has taught me the secret of entering into time! It can help us even though it involves you destroying some things! But don't worry! I'm not giving up on you... We have all the time in this country we needed! This can wait, guys... Don't be afraid! We're all just waiting for someone called The Wizard here to turn on his magic! Let him show us how it's done! We'll leave immediately, thank you and goodbye... We'll meet again, I'm sure. I'll bring the rest of my people with us! See you later. See ya! BLA! LARGE BLOW! GO! Go! BOOM! EGO GHOST! "... He spun and then swooped down to release all three of Nienor's magical gifts!

As he did so, Nueno had gathered all his Magic potions. They held the Secret of Continuity in their hands, wrapped them, bound them with a spell, sent them onward, while running back to finish the job. Nudos and the Grumps followed as well. Eventually everything was in place and they were on way!
Away they went, passing over the world at a dizzying speed. Their speed was even faster than their magical powers. It amazed them that even The Eldar's magical power was not able...to hold up against it! (That's why it was considered a magical gift...)

As the band made their final pass, some magic happened behind them! Their wand was made out whole of gold, of course! One magical stone had already been used to create their wand. No matter how many people they brought to life inside, nobody could make it up themselves - nobody was born in Time - no one was created equal! They were like a whole new world for them after they entered them!

When they hit time again there was magic happening around them in every dimension! Many new magic potencies were created, bringing them close to making

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the world isn't just a funny or funnyky combination of things and events in space. It is also filled with the most amazing stories and things! If we look to other higher-dimensional worlds, like the Megalos universe of H.P. Lovecraft, or perhaps even the galaxy that our own universe occupies, many things are even stranger and even more fascinated!

One such other universe is the famous Myers' Briggs Universal Index - IUI for short. Originally created in 1963 by John A. Myer and James Brigggs, this index has undergone many modifications throughout its history - from the initial version that had just two dimensions in its classification, to various versions that now have even higher numbers of categories!

Interestingly enough both Myer's and Brigger's bodies didn't live long enough to complete this mission. Our current IUVSD1 and IUDM2 are the world's most well-known and well liked versions of this amazing universe.

What is one thing that these two bodies could not accomplish...yet?

Well, what do you know, my dear children? There are only two things possible for things to be! Either they have a higher I score or they don't have it at all! The Iscore is determined primarily by two factors: intelligence and personality. Intelligent creatures of all kinds can have very high scores on the I - and they just love the subject, right? Personality is a more subjective measure - it's only based on traits like personality issues, impulsivity, depression, self-confidence, motivation, hope, resentment, ambition, self-pity, pride, emotional temperament, aggressiveness, fear, anxiety, anger, sadness, guilt, paranoia, hopelessness etc.

Let's take an example of an intelligent creature: the human brain. A person's brain is composed of multiple billions of neurons and hundreds of billions more nerve endings, all interconnected and forming various neural networks. Think of humans as billions, each of these neural systems as a single neuron, thousands of synapses and billions or trillions of connections inside the brain...just think of it like brainwaves and everything!
The I is based primarily on intelligence! A person has to have plenty of intelligence (as opposed to intellectual abilities) to score high on it. Basically, intelligence measures the number and variety of ways your brain understands and processes information. With the ability to mentally solve problems - how many ideas do we have before we start thinking? Intuition and experience can play a crucial role here, as well as creativity and other interesting or unusual ideas. Also, people that have an "edge" when it comes to studying and using mathematical terms (mathematicians or math geeks!) can score quite highly on their I.

Other than intelligence, personality represents the way your personality makes you behave when faced with situations. Because a person's personality is entirely dependent upon his/her genetic makeup and its experiences throughout his or her lifetime, it's difficult to generalize about individual traits. But from my experience, high level intelligence can also turn people into cool types or even super-powered animals! This makes sense, considering most animals tend to cluster together at a level below their average personality and show personality traits such as aggression, dominance, empathy, courage, sensitivity etc.
Let's say an animal has the capacity to fly. After all, flies have the same structure and genes as humans...if they had that capacity, chances are they'd fly and create other creatures to populate the universe. No matter how their intelligence comes into play, no creatures would evolve in such high numbers that you could keep count of them or their lives - so would they be able to out-populate the existing species? No...because as mentioned earlier, genetics is deterministic! Everything is predetermination in biological evolution; animals and plants tend toward becoming extinct unless they change completely. Thus, most life-forms would either evolve to become extinct or to leave some residue to survive (think of parasites that infect certain crops or harmful bacteria found in some parts of our bodies.)

The only possible exception would to some certain species that evolve naturally - some higher order creatures such as: the beasts in nature, reptiles in particular (though not all beasty beings have evolved in this way). Because of their nature (most beaches that are overgrown with plants and vegetation don't form animals either), beavers and dragons - for example - would eventually be extinct; with enough luck, humans and their descendents would find a way to stop them. Once they do, both species would end up becoming very extinct, too!
