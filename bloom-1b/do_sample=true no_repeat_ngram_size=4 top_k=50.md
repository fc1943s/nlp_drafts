## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the universe doesn't end up with you and me! This concept was famously suggested by Balenciaga, who coined the phrase "borderless universe" to describe it.

Now let's look at a few examples of how we can use "endless universes" to create beautiful objects.

At first, we can consider these two items. They both have some sort of texture that resembles leather, but neither has any structure like wood or stone. They seem to perfectly fit together, and yet both have no physical basis to define them as one!

The first one is an original Balenciaga jacket, and it's a classic example of what we can call a "borderless universe." Take a look at the jacket:

It's quite easy to see how this design can be used to create a piece of art that would make you want to slap yourself on the back...or at least look at it! You can't just add a bunch of small texture patches like this to cover objects or even something like a coat or blazer; this would not make these pieces of art work at all!

Another example is a Balenciaga skirt that I have created a lot of. It's got a bunch of patterned stripes arranged in a wide line, but it's not hard to see how these patterns could all have a unique meaning. Take a look:

Since this piece of art would also fit into a bordersless universe, there's a pretty good chance you and I could come up with a new way of displaying this sort of art.

Let's try a few examples that might work even if they didn't fit into a "borderseless universe".

Have you ever read any books specifically about "Artificial Intelligence"? The term "Artificial World" is quite interesting, and seems to be an appropriate label for these computers. Of course, as is common with computer-related terms, they are really just an approximation! Let's now take a look at one of the most famous and well-used terms in such area: "Digital Image".

Let's take a closer look at this image:

This image was created by someone called Andrew Rubenstein. His goal was to create an animated version of this famous painting of the Statue of Liberty by the great artist Gustave Moreau. This is the most popular painting in the history of painting - a popular painting that inspired countless people and made art history. Unfortunately, Andy Rubenstein was unable to recreate exactly the same painting in digital form using the exact same technique, as he couldn't find anything in the book by Gustave Moreau himself!!

What did this mean - that was why his entire work was never completed? We all know that he died young - no matter how much he looked forward to his future. But he may have left us with some incredible pieces of art that we still can't find their way into our daily life; this could be because these pieces of original art were destroyed or just never existed. But this could also be that Andy Rubenstein created his digital image from scratch - the painting may have been destroyed before he was able to create it!

When we see the digital representation of this painting, one of the issues to be answered is - how does the digital image even relate to the original? Let's take a closer view at this digital image...

The result? A digital image that resembles the original. It's hard to say what happened with Andy Rubenstein; we'll leave it up to you to guess how this image came about!

Now let's put together some of the most important principles of digital art:

Just like pictures, art prints are based on different materials. Each type of material will have its own physical properties, so you and I wouldn't want someone to create an image that is based on a different type of material from the one he used to create the image! We still have to consider issues like weather effects, dust, UV rays, moisture, water, scratches, and so on! This means that even though a digital representation can replicate any physical object, it cannot accurately reproduce the physical material of each piece of art. Furthermore, objects in digital image are only as good as how the medium the image was created from is, so even if we created the digital image from an exact copy of the original painting, it's very possible that the artwork would still be

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the universe is incredibly interesting. Maybe you've also come across a few things that intrigue you a bit and have been curious about the underlying causes that lead to the formation of those objects. Well, those objects are called categories - and let's see what category theory is all about.

Let's consider the simplest possible categorization thing that makes sense for us here: people...or so we would think. Let's say that one person has two different categories - called A and B - and that one person also has two different "names" too. Let's call these names x and y - and let's assume that both x and y can be referred to in a meaningful way. Let's take a more complicated situation and assume that one of our four people in our universe, John, has three different categorizations, namely Alice, Stephen, and John - and let's say that each of these three named people are also categorized using different words. Now let's imagine that John's name is now no more than a single word (and therefore cannot be used as a categorization), but instead it is a categorization based on x, y, and z - that is, John's name might be written in the form xz+yz... And so on. What does this mean?

On one hand, this is a very cool thing! People can come up with very strange theories of what these names actually mean, and this is especially true for people living in different cultures. Maybe if we just said out loud each of these categorizations so that people can listen and see how we use them instead of asking them questions about them, we could find some truth in this strange idea...


Now let's consider another example. Say that if we were to compare our four people to four animals and ask them whose categories they are, then we would expect more animals to give us an explanation of what animals really are. However, we wouldn't get any answers, since animals do not live in such different dimensions as humans. Is this a case in point of categories theory as claimed by some individuals?

Of course, there are cases where certain animals will have different categories than humans because their own body sizes differ dramatically. For example, when looking at our own body, we will naturally divide it into two types of components - fat and muscle. But when looking at an animal, we should divide the animal into the main parts - the body and the tail! Thus, when we ask the question, where lives the tail? then there is likely not a single answer in the universe. Since there is certainly no scientific reason why our body should naturally divide up into three parts, it seems reasonable that some animals should be able to give us reasons why these categories exist. However, it is important to note that if our animals give us enough reasons for categories to occur, then they will most likely not be able to explain how we categorize all of them based on this theory...

So just like humans do in many cases, animals do have the ability to explain categories. This means that in many cases animals can provide an answer to how organisms, such as us, categorize things. In other words animals can answer the question: What is the name of my tail...?

In order to learn more about category theory, we need a theory of categories. This is an important thing to know, because if we need to discuss what category theory actually means, we need something to talk about. Let's take an example and see how it is usually used:

Consider these two boxes - two versions of an X box - and you can put anything into them. Now let's take a look at the "left" box:

This box can contain the following categories:

Now let's take a step back and consider what the human brain would tell us about the above box:

Remember that humans naturally divide the left box into two different categories. The first is the categories that describe the material items and the second is the categorization that refers to the psychological properties of each item in the box. It is only now that we can actually understand what the left item inside the box actually is - namely the category describing the "tail". So what do we call the category that describes the "tail?" In other words does the brain naturally name these categories?

The answer is

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the existence of other dimensions means there are other forces at work that cause things to change their shape and/or move apart or towards another place. And of course the world of nipple movement isn't one to be frowned upon!

One of the few examples of this phenomenon we get from the media is the case of the notorious nipple pornography cult - this is just another example of the fact that people seem to be incredibly curious about the nipple movement of other entities. Let's start by looking at a picture of a cute little nipple:

It's actually fairly rare to actually find this kind of thing on the Internet (most pornography is taken from other people's nipple movies) - so what does this one in particular tell us about the movements of other nipple-like entities?

This one was taken from the movie "Black Swan" - a video of a young blonde actress named Kate Bosworth dancing a swirling nipple to the song "The Thrill of It All". Yes, this is a pretty hot nipple, isn't it?

Here's another nipple-like object:

A nipple-like robot is one of the most famous characters in "Sonic The Hedgehog" - this might be one of the more obscure nipple-like objects in the history of video games! This thing seems to really like to move around, does it?!

Now, let's start by getting as close as possible to this guy:

Here's the thing - his body isn't made of muscle! It's actually flesh! And it's quite interesting to note from these two images that the nipple-like thing seems to like to move out and forth and to the left and right in this guy - it does in fact look like it has a somewhat random movement.

This one is obviously very different (I think):

The guy here is a real nipple (but he's not a nipple), apparently! And while it's not very pretty, I think it's quite interesting that a real nude guy would like to have this sort of a "random" and "off-base" nipple-like behavior! This may possibly just be one of those things that, if done correctly, can actually have an important effect on the world...or not!

So now that we know we have other forces influencing nipple movement, what do we do about this strange and weird behavior?

Well if we can prove that it was a real nudge force involved, we could certainly change things a bit! One way of doing this - and it's almost a possibility that we can really prove this - is to ask someone to try this on them and see if it works! Of course this process will still require someone to have the nipple "work" or be able to "slide" - otherwise the nipple won't produce the "nudge" effect on this particular guy! (Please note that I am only saying this is the possibility because I haven't tried this out yet!)

Next time I come around I'll take a look at the nipple movies we have already seen in the past to see whether I can actually "read" (sketch) out one of those cute nipple videos on people's nipple movements! I am sure these pictures will tell us something about those nipple-like "animals"...


ChapterThirty Seven
The Cosmic Wheel

This is the final topic of the current chapter, and it's not for the faint of heart!
We began the chapter with a beautifully illustrated illustration of the creation of the universe through the stars and galaxies. That illustration shows that there is an unstoppable, constant flow of energy through space-time - and that energy sources are found in all parts of it (even the cosmos itself!). We also learned very little about the origin of these energy sources! And that's okay! As long as we believe in the Cosmic Wheel, then as long as we stay in the 3+1 dimensional realm, we should probably keep learning about the origin and nature of our universe!

Now let us bring it back to our Cosmic Wheels, and let's explore their formation. As much as we may believe in The Big Bang theory, we really don't know much about how everything happened! And let's be honest - even if we were to do some research and learn a little

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts we have been learning, think about an elephant that is playing with a ball in the air. It is the elephant and not the ball that makes the problem! The ball is floating - meaning that you cannot easily see it. The elephant can see the ball floating down and up depending on whether it is at its nose or tail. This makes it impossible for him to distinguish between the elephant and the ball so that he can do anything with it!

When you play with a ball, you can either hold it against your head and play with the "left" side of your body (your fingers and your thumb moving along that side), or you can let it fall and play with your right hand, which makes it easier for you to control it! You can choose to hold the ball to your nose or your tail depending on your own preference. In either case, however, there's more to it that you didn't even think about! In the next few chapters we will be going over the concepts of dimension and geometry in mathematics, but for now, let's consider what type of function you would call a function that is applicable to an elephant moving around in an air ball!

In this chapter, we'll begin going through various mathematical concepts in order to better understand how they relate to the idea of dimension travel. In this particular example, we'll use an elephant with a ball stuck to its nose to talk about these concepts. And while we are discussing these types of functions, we'll use MathJax to give you access to the symbols and functions we have previously discussed.

MathJax is a tool that allows people to easily insert mathematical code into their documents - and in this case, our MathJax files are very easy to use - just right click on the MathJax file, select "Background", and then "Add Mathematical code...". Notice how this shows you how to do what you know about mathematical functions, and how to do it using MathJax! :)

For now, let's quickly see how some mathematical functions relate to how dimensions affect things in our universe!

For starters, there is the classic exponential function, which is one of the simplest mathematical functions - and as such, it will play a part very important in determining how a particular object moves around in a 4D globe!

To express this function, we simply use MathJAX to write out what follows; this is also the simplest way to do MathJax, so don't get worried if it looks weird for you! And note that these function symbols are very familiar to us folks in the real world - as in "!*~#$%%=*&-*." are the same words as used in our sentences!

In other words, we would say that:

Let x be an object that is traveling into Dimension X (and we know that Dimension X has x lower than it's own native dimensionality; e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)!
Then, when x hits a point in Dimension Y (and we also know that Dimension Y has x lower then it's own native dimension; e.g., 1, 2), it will experience an acceleration f, which will create a force F (= f*cosθ) on x's face
Now let's say that a point x is traveling into a new (3+1)-dimensional universe with F acting upon it! Now we have shown that x's acceleration f will be twice the same as the acceleration f in our original 3+1-dimensional universe. (x's acceleration in Dimension X would be zero, since there is no need to calculate anything if x is traveling between Dimensions X and Y!) So the answer is:
>> a(x) = 2.0*x/s(x) - 3.0*s(x)*cosθ

Now what is your answer?

As you can see, the answer depends on a whole bunch of mathematics that we haven't touched on yet! For now, let's just take a look at what that answer means! When x travels into Dimension Y, its acceleration f will create an acceleration, known as g, on F and θ. (f*cosθ)

Now just how much does F*cosθ?
Well notice that the right-hand side of the equation always starts off equal

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the process of cognition, people often use categories such as "thoughts" or "awakening the mind" to describe our mental processes. As the world continues to progress, so do our ideas regarding the nature of cognition. There are some that consider cognitive functions to be intrinsic to ourselves, while others take cognition to be some combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Now we will briefly explore these distinct views on cognition.
Cognition is often said to be an autonomous set of mental processes, but people have also begun to classify what happens in our minds in terms of its relationship with external stimuli. This classification can be roughly subdivided into two groups:

Cognitive functions
Cognitive processing

Now for those of you that have never heard of a cognitive function, what does that mean? The Cognitive Function Theory website has a great article describing the difference between cognitive functions and the traditional definition of cognitive operations.

A:

"There is an alternative to the cognitive functions approach in the so-called cognitivism. According to the cognitive resources theory, the function of cognition (in terms of operations, structures, and knowledge) has to be understood in terms of material resources, for example, brain function. Instead of a cognitive functions approach, the notion of what processes are involved in cognition is a matter of debate (for example, in the so-called functionalism theory)."

Intuitively, you can think that information processing involves something more than just extracting/processing information from input. From this perspective it is more or less obvious how we can extract information, store that information and process that information - but maybe you should be more precise: What is the nature of processing?
In general, the brain processes information only if it is given some form of input and is able to extract and store information. However, this is probably not the only role that information processing plays. Information processing is not merely a sequence of events or steps (e.g., information is stored in some form of short-term memory). Rather, information is processed in a continuous stream. In this regard, the notion that information processing must be discrete and sequential should be revised. In the past we have thought that processes had to be discrete and that processing must be sequential, as we thought that information could never take several events and steps.
Cognitive processes can clearly be thought of as separate stages (we should not confuse cognitive processes with cognitive tasks).  For example, the process of making decisions is likely an important part of cognition and processing, but the cognition and the decisions process probably are not the same (some people might say that some cognitive processes are not part of cognitions, but this would probably be wrong from a theoretical perspective, since some cognitive processes oftentimes involve the brain).
The idea of separate stages and a stream of information processing can also be seen if we consider the fact that we cannot think in order - think in a moment of an object or event while trying to think of future and past events and objects. For example, in a short term memory, it might not be possible to think of an event, because it seems like they have already been thought of in the past and present, but in a long term memory it might be possible - only in a long time.

A:

You can make some very strong assertions about a category. For example "I am a human". To make it in a more precise sense you are a human. When in doubt, just refer to human species. Humans have some form of intelligence which involves a very complex set of processes and abilities. We think that we are human, and many animals and plants are also considered to be human beings. However, at the same time we do not see as humans. Many species of animals do not have the kind of intelligence seen in humans, and we do not think that the kind of learning and cognitive processes required for human cognition exist in all animals. These processes are still in use in some ways, but the amount of processes that can do one task, and also be used to carry out additional tasks (e. g. hunting and flight) do not really fit with the ideas about human intellect. In this way, by applying an arbitrary classification, we try

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our understanding of the mathematical principles that give rise to deity mental phenomena, we'll break down the deity mental phenomenon into parts and then look briefly at each one within the context of mathematical thinking and thinking about mathematics.

Deity Mental Phenomena
What is a deity mental effect?

Any of an individual's deity mental experiences can be described as a "mental effect" - whether it's one that results from a person having experiences like a spirit or a deity, or more often than not, a person's mental experiences are a combination of both. For instance, if you ask someone whether or not they have experienced being transported back to previous lifetimes, the answer can be either "yes", "no," or "don't know". An individual's mental perception of deity mental events can be anything from "being transported through the dimensions" to "telling stories" to "feeling strong power"...

Deity Mental Effects in Mathematics
What mathematical properties give rise to mental deities?

It's not just in the physical world where mental phenomena exist! In mathematics as well, it's not possible to simply explain everything in a scientifically rigorous way - some results do not make sense, some mathematical principles do not apply, etc. - so some of our definitions and theories will be inaccurate! But some mathematical results will make perfect sense to us and are valid in our mental world. In particular:

Some mathematical properties have a direct effect on why an entity (let's call them deity characteristics) exists. This type of property applies in the physical and mathematical worlds as well.

Some mathematical properties are used to describe real-life events. For instance:

The number of copies of the same object is equal to the order of that single object in the mathematical world. Similarly, number of occurrences of any given numerical value in an arithmetic sequence is equal to that number in the mathematical universe.

Some mathematical results apply to multiple dimensions at the same time. This is also referred to as a "derivative" - just like in the physical universe, your mathematical operations will apply to the full range of properties of your mathematical domain.

All things considered, it's important to note that most mathematical properties described in this chapter lead to deity characteristics - it's a direct and essential part of a deity's existence. These deity characteristics can be used to account for the existence of deity events and the ability to experience deity mental effects in humans, and in other, lower dimensional beings.

For instance, we have the following property in the number field that makes number theory true mathematically:

The degree of a perfect square n is equal to twice the order of the sum of all the squares that are squares with the degree of n.

This tells us that the sum of squares of degrees of numbers must also equal to twice that number. It turns out that an addition of any numbers is equivalent to another addition modulo 2; so, for instance, an addition of two squares of degrees 8 and 10 is equivalent to an addition of 2 squares of degrees, while an addition of four squares of degrees is equivalent to a division of 2 squares with a square of degree 7.
Similarly, we have a property called "prime factorization". In this property, a finite number is defined as a multiple of a perfect prime. For instance, |3| is a prime factorization of 11, though it is not necessarily the prime factorization itself.

In other words, all of our mathematical properties used to describe the physical universe have a significant mathematical effect on the appearance of deity types.

Deity Aspects of Mathematics
What do mathematic ideas have to do with being the owner of a deidad?

This question was posed by Alex, the creator of The Deity and the Church, who asked, "Do mathematical ideas have to be Christian in nature to be God's?"

This is a very difficult question if asked properly, and it deserves its own chapter! But for now, let's just note that every mathematical phenomenon describes a different aspect of mathematics, and thus is a mathematical concept. It could even describe different parts of mathematics at the same time: such is the case when we speak about the concept of "convexity".

Let's say we're interested in the geometry behind mathematics. Then some of the geometric properties that

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict and understand the concept of "entropy" we will need to introduce the term "cognitiveness." Entropic cognition could just as easily be explained using mathematics! In particular, when a person engages in mental arithmetic, is said to be doing so because it serves the purposes of the mind. In a recent lecture, Alan Watts explained:

Cognitive functions or mathematical functions are processes by which we obtain knowledge and information. These processes are usually implemented as mathematical formulas or rules that can be applied to situations which require them and are then used to solve situations that are more complicated than those where the mathematical function applies. These mathematical functions include mathematical logic, geometry, probability theory, number theory, and many other mathematical topics...

In addition, entropy - a statistical concept - is closely intertwining with mathematics for several reasons. First, although the concept of entropy is not specifically involved in physics, it is used in other branches of science to describe the phenomenon of uncertainty (i.e., the inability to make a final decision regarding a question without first obtaining as much information as possible.). Second, it has also been applied to describe the fact that things behave in a non-stationary and unpredictable manner, regardless of whether we are consciously aware of it. For example, in science - rather than thinking of entropy as a constant it is commonly used as a measurement of the degree of unpredictability. Third, and more important, it is closely associated with information processing, and also with mathematics (where it is called information processing).

In addition, it was suggested in a recent book ("The Mathematical Physics of Memory" by Richard Fagan) that in our brains the concepts of time and order can be expressed by using mathematical models. In particular mathematically, time can be defined to mean a sequence of events starting when and ending at a given point or point in time. We can then understand that if time is used in math or when doing math, this is also something we would define to mean a sequential process in which events can be grouped and organized into distinct categories. For example - by taking the most recent events into account and grouping them into time periods that contain specific events or categories of events - we can arrive at the notion that time and order are not the same thing as a mathematical process, but rather a sequential process that runs from the past back to the present.

It should be noted that information is a very important aspect of cognition - it is what the mind uses to think, reason and create. However, the concept that information is actually the thing that drives thinking is a somewhat controversial one, and one of the most interesting things you will discover as you explore more about mathematics and the concept of time, is the way that it can be manipulated.
First, a very important term - memory - has been introduced to express the fact that there was a period of time when human beings believed - and still believe today - that information was stored and retrieved quickly without any kind of delay. This ability to forget quickly has been an underestimated part of human evolutionary history and can be used to play the role of the mind in various scenarios of science fiction fiction, television and video games. According to the popular story of the Matrix, one of the key factors in the existence of this ability is the fact that time is incredibly fragmented, and each of us becomes dependent on the memories and information stored in other people - for example, in an effort to navigate from one position of high power to another, people often rely on past knowledge that is stored in a person who was there before them or in an information provided by another person to them - in each case, we are relying on this other person's memory or the memories of others who have had similar experiences in our life - thus causing our ability to forget to exist in the first place.

In the end, it is important to note that if we take time as a key feature of information, then all information must be capable of storing and retrieving its own memory information at the same time. This is particularly important in information that we are required to keep in our minds in order to complete important situations and tasks - a situation that is often a nightmare when we are surrounded by so much information.

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we will encounter in these chapters, we have included some examples of how we might use mathematics to better model mathematical concepts. In addition, we will now describe some important theorems used for these models. As already mentioned in Chapter Twenty Ten, we will begin the chapter by exploring the concepts of set, algebra, and number. Then we will move on the subject of counting and sorting - these concepts and theorems play an important role in how we solve mathematical equations. Finally, we will investigate some well-known mathematical theorems that are directly tied to our ability to compute.

Theory of Set

Essentially, the theory of set consists of the five concepts that make up of it all - that is, sets themselves, their elements, sets that intersect, subsets of sets, and what is known as the operation of intersection and the operation of containing - all of which are discussed in the chapter below.

The set of all numbers

This concept is so important, we will use it as a starting point for understanding what happens when we move from set theory to more advanced concepts. We will begin by discussing the cardinality of sets, or the number of objects in a set. To understand what happens when one sets out to count objects in a given set, we need some sort of mathematical model to work with - the set theory for sets.

Sets and their numbering

Now let's begin by considering how sets are identified and counted. This will show us how sets and numbers are related. We are able to count objects when we consider each of the five sets individually, then when we combine them into the set of all objects.

Sets that intersect

Next we'll explore the concept of the set of intersecting objects. This could be understood as each of our 5 sets intersecting; one of the sets is taken as a blanket and added to all other sets together - this sets up the basis for counting the number of sets that intersect. If we consider it as intersecting sets at a moment in time, then we understand how we count the number of times they intersect, and they need only be counted once! We can also see that the most common method is the inclusion method - it involves taking an intersection of the blanket set and all other sets and summing the intersections - this is very similar to subtracting a blanket set from one or more individual sets, and then summing those subtractions.

Sets that cover

Next we'll see how sets can be taken out to calculate the number of things that are contained in them. When we consider sets as a blankets that cover other blankets, then we can take out the blankets - this gives us the number of cover sets.

Sets that are not contained

Finally, we are also able to calculate the difference between sets with each set being taken off and then summed to find the total of sets that are not taken, and this is known as set expansion - we can get a rough idea of how large a set is by just calculating how many sets it covers.

Sets as sets of elements

Finally, we'll move on to consider how the intersection between two sets is counted. In mathematics, we can work with the set-theory for sets - all we need to consider is what every subset of another is called - this concept is referred to as the mathematical definition of subset (or subscript).

The subset of all integers

Next we can look at the set of integers, which are our mathematical representations of all numbers. Using the set-theoretical concepts, we can now consider how two sets of integers intersect to calculate the set of differences. The intersection of two sets is defined as the set that is the union of the two sets - all the elements in both of the two unions have been subtracted from the total to create a single set. Now if we consider every set of integers being taken out, and then we add them together, we can see that all intersections are contained in only one set - that is the set of difference sets.

Set of integers as a subset of other numbers

Finally, when adding the sets back together using the mathematical way of subtraction, we get the total of all number sets, and this concept is known as intersection. Remember, we could consider the set of set union

## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts and mechanics of space-based computation in this chapter we have simplified the following functions and procedures using an analogy: computers that are running programs on hard drives. In physics, computers are basically made of particles of matter: protons and neutrons; there may be electrons and other impurities in addition, but these are really just particles. As part of the basic functions in a computer, programs are stored in the form of binary files. This means that these files contain instructions for how the computer will implement its tasks. A typical CPU (central processing unit) is made up of these instructions - in this case, it converts the user's input into what the CPU knows about the specific task and how it should perform it. However, in physics, we would like to focus on the ability of the CPU to process information.

In general, programming a computer is pretty simple to understand. Essentially, we are to create a program in the form a sequence of instructions/programs, in binary format, that performs a designated task. This may involve reading input data, finding solutions to problems, and performing calculations. The program will usually be a text file or similar structure (although there are sometimes tools to automate the creation of programs).

Now the real magic in programming a computer involves understanding the programming language, or what programs are made of, and the instructions within those programs. Once you understand these basic steps in programming, you can begin to understand the inner workings of a CPU.

One of the main reasons that computers are in so high demand for users today is that they are capable of solving problems in many different areas of life - from the simple math equations that students often encounter at school, to solving problems in scientific fields such as astronomy and chemistry, to the more complex tasks involved in solving complex problems related to science, technology, and medicine.

In fact, the human mind is like a computer. The human mind is a powerful computer with a built-in processing ability. The power is not just the inherent processing ability; it includes more important components such as, for example, storing information, processing information, and communicating information.

For example, we often get this question at school: Does any one who cannot read write write is mentally ill? Well, we can only tell that an individual has a mental illness, since if they are able to read and write, it would mean that they have their cognitive functions working perfectly - they have developed a system to process the information in their minds. This is very important in understanding the abilities of our minds: if we do not have basic cognitive functions available - like reading or writing - then it is very difficult for us to understand people who have higher levels of intellect or higher levels of ability than us.

As discussed above, computers use binary files to store instructions for doing their task. So to understand programs written in computer language, the first step is to figure out what instructions they contain. If you don't know the instructions you are running a computer program in, then it's much easier to learn to read these computer programs instead of running them!

Remember the basic principle of physics: a force is an object's effect on another object; the effect depends on the magnitude, location, and direction of the force, as well as the object that is being acted upon.

We can illustrate this point in some simpler terms; imagine a cat falling through a hole - the cat will either hit the ground, or hit the wall. The first case is exactly what happens if a cat ran through a door; it would land on the floor, where it could restrain itself from falling or, if it was strong enough, would continue on and land on a surface rather than fall into the hole. On the other hand, the cat that ran through a big hole like our hypothetical 4 Dimensional universe, would continue to move freely through all of eternity! In fact, it's possible to run a simple computer program through such a computational process, by using a special computer language called a "virtual machine". Essentially virtual machines are computer programs that can be programmed to simulate physical computers - the difference is that the program that runs on the real physical computer, is actually a series of instructions written in a binary file, whereas the program using a virtual machine is purely a program composed of

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concept of mathematics on which we are ultimately based in our education, we'll now give you one picture of one of our favorite scientists, Albert Einstein. He was really well-known at the time of his life (and still is at this very young age) for his innovative ideas regarding the nature of space-time, Einstein's equivalence principle, and his fundamental theory of relativity; three of the pillars upon which all of this research is based! Let me take just a moment to introduce the names of some of the most important theoretical foundations related to the theory of relativity: the fundamental equations that relate the speed of light to the speed of propagation of light; the laws of relativistic mechanics; and the theory of special relativity, which describes the motion of all objects in 4, 5, and 6 dimensions. Before we continue on with our look at mathematics, allow me to first discuss Einstein's many other accomplishments, and I'll give some tips for the future on how to apply mathematical concepts to these important and life-defining subjects!

Einstein was born in Germany in December 1879. He had a lot of influence on the development of modern science and space and time in general. In this last few chapters, we will look at some mathematical concepts that Einstein used in his work. In the beginning, he wanted to use a simple geometrical structure to describe the motion of a particle in an imaginary universe. He developed complicated mathematical formulas to describe how a moving particle could get between different times and then again to describe how particles could move across space without moving any closer than their original positions at any given instant! What is really amazing is that even some of these "mathematical formulas" were derived from very simple questions!

First, we should take a moment to notice that even Einstein's theories were just ideas: they didn't come to life at the atomic level! His many other theories were just examples of his ideas, and they were never implemented into any of the experiments he did. However, Einstein's work did have a lot to do with the fundamental physics of particles and the universe itself. Remember that all of the "mathematical ideas" that he wanted to create and test in his own lifetime were a bunch of ideas that people were struggling to figure out how to apply to the world around them - Einstein wanted to use the same thought processes that we use to apply to everyday life to try and solve all of the mysteries of the Universe! For the first time that people used these thought processes to really solve real-world problems, Einstein was the first to recognize them as such! When we look at our daily lives in this era, we can see how these principles really have an important role - for example, we often think that something can only be true when we know exactly how a piece of information changes from one side to the other - but really, that change is only part of the experience! For example, a person on the right side of a picture can take on the viewpoint shown on the left and get this same feel for the picture! Remember how time can change both directions? As a person travels from right to left through space-time in the same instant, it's always changing that change, not time itself! So it's true that time is a single direction in which we can move, but it's always moving in multiple directions simultaneously that makes time a complicated and changing concept and not just a single direction.

Let's take a moment and think about some of the other mathematical ideas that come into play in everyday life and life in general. The second picture below shows two of Einstein's many more important ideas as he explains why he invented the concept of black holes:

First of all, what really makes a black hole a black hole? Well based on Einstein's theory about space-time, a black hole is actually a big region of spacelike geometry - the volume of spacetime that is completely empty! Because black holes are basically empty, their mass is extremely small! At that point they are called black holes because the mass that we see appears black on the outside. However, if you go slightly further down, you can actually find masses that are bigger than those of a single black hole. In other words - if you think that a black hole would be bigger than space itself, then you

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what I mean by cognitive functions, I would like to give a short rundown of some of the most important mathematical concepts and theorems used in this field.

In the area of mathematics, there are a variety of different types of theorems. The most well-known theory of these theorems is the axiomatic approach to mathematics. With an axiomatic approach, you need to explicitly prove mathematical statements to know them - in other words, you need a theory that has a set of axioms, like, say, that if something is possible, then it necessarily must be true! Since humans are typically quite intuitive in areas such as logic, they tend to rely heavily on their intuitive rather than logicbased theories when trying to prove mathematical statements. This is probably why, historically, most mathematicians have done just that!

However, a more rigorous approach to mathematics consists of giving proof that mathematical statements are true. It basically means that instead of proving a mathematical statement, we must find enough empirical evidence to prove it using mathematical theorems. This is a rather tedious and time-consuming process. To understand what I mean, consider using the axiomatic proof of the identity law of mass: if mass is a constant at rest, then its time derivative must equal zero. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem very intuitive to anyone without some mathematical background, especially to someone without a mathematical background.

Therefore, to better understand the process of proof, let's break this down into the following three steps:

Defining a set of properties that we take to be true.
Defining a mathematical construct that will give us empirical evidence of each of these properties.
Proving these properties using mathematical theoremas.
Considering the results of the proof. It turns out that in all three of these steps, we can use mathematics without having any mathematical background! So, although the axiomatic and rigorous mathematical approaches are somewhat different, they both provide a way of exploring a given problem without having to resort to mathematics.  

For example, in studying math, a student could first have an intuitive understanding of algebra before beginning to study linear algebra in high school and then studying functional analysis in college! This concept of mathematical induction is an example of one of the most influential methods for proving mathematical statements. If you want to know more, click here!

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict how people classify themselves on an interpersonal level, it's helpful to divide an individual into several different scales. For example, if you want to group people into 3 categories, someone who believes there is something higher than them will be placed in the first category, someone who thinks they're very similar to others will be placed next to them, and someone who sees themselves as completely unique will be placed far above the group as a whole. In this way, people can have a better understanding of the types of people they know, how different people act, and how they would respond to different kinds of circumstances. This is especially useful when we need to discuss what kind of person or relationship we would desire from someone, or why we might want to do something to the person we have in mind!

So, from the perspective of the modern person who has been introduced to interpersonal dynamics, there are four different types of people. These are represented on a scale from 1 to 4 (and on to the left). In each case, the left side represents the type of person that the person feels they're most like - the middle, one with a different opinion than the first person in the group, and the right side represents the personality of an individual that they definitely would not want in their own life!

It's important to note that all 4 of these dimensions are present in reality! However, we are currently interested in studying how people process their interpersonal experiences from the perspective that is present in their own real life! We'll assume that the human experience is essentially represented by the enneagram hierarchy that we found in The Enneagram, a popular psychological test that defines how people evaluate each other. If you haven't heard of the test or have only heard of the dimensions that are part of it, please read about that here!

First, let's introduce this important terminology. What is an enneagram? Enneagram means "dividual type".  A common way of thinking about enneagrams is to think of them as a psychological test that we can use to find out what people are attracted to and to what kind of characters they identify most with. Enneagrams show what type of character or personality we are naturally drawn to and what personality we identify with most, when compared to other people. But of course, this is a simplified way of thinking.  The reality is that each person is unique - we all have different attractions and we all identify with a slightly different personality.
Let's now turn to the description of each of the different types of personality - we expect we aren't going to learn too much here at first, but you should probably get a feel for the different facets of people's character by looking at their enneagram.

The first person in this list is called Ideal Personality Type 1 (I-P1-Type 1). This is the person who is most attracted to ideal others.  They are the person who represents things we find most attractive in others - things like being sweet and caring, being polite and kind, being intelligent and fun, and being able to relate to others.  This person is also very good at finding pleasures - they like to dance, have fun and socialize; they are also the ones who make most of their favorite movies; and they tend to be more open to new experiences than others in their circles

The second type of personality we call Ideal Personality Types 2 (I-P2-Type 2) is the ones who find others to be more like their own ideal personality. They are naturally attracted to someone you identify with in a larger sense - someone you think you are like yourself but aren't really - someone who you would be a better match with.  This person tends to be more independent and more passionate than the previous person; they can be extremely strong, independent, and have a strong voice.

The third personality in this list, I-P3-Type 3, is the ones we think are the most alike to ourselves but aren't really. This person is naturally attracted to others who are very similar to themselves; this makes them very sociable, are warm and friendly, and enjoy engaging in a good conversation. They can also be slightly shy and introverted because they don't see things the same way as others - you may not be able to understand their logic

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the concept of hip hop, I've divided it into two parts:

First, consider what Hip Hop is. It's a genre of music characterized by rapid and highly dynamic rhythms, melodic and lyrical flow, and often aggressive and flamboyant lyrics. As the name implies, it has a strong focus on rhyme (like rap). It also involves rappers (with a great deal of skill) in many aspects of the sound, such as beat making, producing the beat, rapping, recording, and mixing. The rapper usually plays instruments (most commonly piano and guitar), although singers have also been heard performing the act.

Then, consider how we can get to a specific rhythm (like the beat).

First, consider the beat. The beat is the basic rhythmic pattern that defines a track (a song, a dance movement, a beat). For Hip Hop, the beat is usually composed of 6 to 8 bars. However, there is much flexibility with this approach - some rappers prefer using 6 or 9 bars, while others prefer 8 bars. On the downside, most rappers feel that their verses could be better and more powerful if their rhythmic patterns were more structured. So, as an example, let's see a simple beat composed of just 4 bars:

You could create many different basic beat patterns this way - let's consider a more complex example for now.

Imagine adding another element to the basic beat pattern - a hook. This is a section of a verse that can change the beat from a very fast to a slower rhythm. For example, when trying to describe something slow or fast we typically speak about it as "high (or low)," "high (and low)," or even "high (low) and low" - instead of "high...and low" or "high (high)...and low".

You can also mix elements to create different rhythmic effects:

As an example, consider the following beat pattern:

This would look very similar to the "High (high)," but instead of having the word "high" in the next bar, it would now include a "mixed" (a) and (t) - using the same letter combination that was originally used to describe the previous "high." The effect may change depending on the number of sounds produced, but the result would be similar.

Then consider how we could play the rhythm based on the current beat...

As an example you may know the "hook" was originally designed to help the audience keep track of the lyrics, so they can focus on them. However, in today s hip hop culture, the hook is often used as a rhythmic element, as well. So, here is a simple hook to create with just four bars:

Now let's consider some possible ideas for creating a hook.

Add one more rhythmic phrase that starts after the beginning of the hook (see the diagram for the idea above):

Add another rhythm element that plays immediately after (see the next diagram):

Finally, add a variation to the basic hook:

If you were wondering why you would want to do so, there's an underlying concept: Rhythmic Control Techniques (RCT). RCT - short for Rhythmical Control Techniques - is a technique developed to help rappers make music that rhymes. Basically, RCT is a system consisting of several key words and phrases (some are specific and other more generic such as "WHITE" or "DON'T DARE") used to control the rhythm in the song. For example if a rap artist uses the word "W" at the beginning of a line (for example "WHITES ME"), it is not really a rhythm element but a control word. Also if the artist uses the phrase "WHITE ON EVERY STATION" (similar to that word in the song as a control phrase), it is much harder to make the raper keep track of what he is doing and create the right rhythmic flow.

Now that you have a better idea of what it means to be a "beat" and a "hook", let's explore how they interact when moving through time.

First, consider how to

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the entire universe is made up of 3+1 dimensions, not four! But let's first study whether a particular geometry conforms to a physical system. If the 3+1 dimensional world we experience is really the true structure of the universe then we will know exactly what it is made of. Otherwise, we may not feel the complete sense of existence because we won't have been able to discover certain fundamental characteristics of our world by analyzing the behavior of real-world phenomenon in that higher dimensional space. This concept of conformance with reality was first formulated by mathematician Poincaré in the middle of the 20th century. In other words it is the only mathematical tool that researchers are allowed to use in order to prove the existence of a universe!

If we look at the world as a collection of pieces of puzzle that we try to assemble together to form a whole, then we will observe that the mathematical tools that researchers are currently able to use can be used to analyze several areas of the physical world - for example, the study of quantum physics, astronomy, and cosmology. In other areas which don't require a great deal of analysis, such tools tend to come in handy too: for example, to figure out if a model is correct enough to explain the behavior of an object!

The idea behind homotopy type theory is that if things in reality conform to the mathematical model that we are able to form, then things in the mathematical model must also conform to our experience. Mathematically, this means that a geometrical object must be homotopic to another object - that is, it must look exactly like the mathematical model in which it is defined!

According to Poincaré, the fact that all space-time is curved is just an illusion: in fact this illusion is caused by a defect in the definition of geometry: the space-time itself is actually a 3+1 dimensional manifold without any space-time metric!

So that doesn't necessarily mean that geometry shouldn't also conform to reality - in fact, geometries of varying degrees of conformance can actually explain some of the physical phenomena we see around us even if that conformance is not complete. To understand how a particular geometry describes our experience we must look for mathematical objects that can be called upon to represent different physical processes.

The mathematical objects that are called upon are called homotopy types. The idea behind homotopies is that by altering the definition of space-time in a way, we can transform an abstract mathematical structure into another abstract mathematical structure. For example, we could alter the definition of the 3+1 space by cutting the 3+1 dimension, giving the result a 4-dimension. Similarly, we could combine all the dimensions into a different higher dimensional space, and the resulting space could be called a fiber bundle. Then by altering the metric on each fiber, we can change the behavior of objects within this higher dimensional space.
If a space-time exists in which all the possible homotopy types are well-defined, that means that it is in the same mathematical category as the world as we currently experience! This is a wonderful mathematical insight that helps us form a comprehensive theory of reality!

If all geometrical objects in all 3+1 dimensional spaces fit neatly into this mathematical category, then it is called a universal covering space. This means that if we know how many different geometrical objects all 3+1 dimensions contain, we know how to build an entire universe. The most common example of a universal covering for 3+1 space is known as the conifold.

To give a concrete example, imagine a large forest of cones, where each cone contains a unique "fruit". This fruit is the mathematical object we are talking about here - this mathematical object can be thought of as having a structure that tells us all about how "cone" is an abstract mathematical object (it is what most of us refer to as "the cone's geometry"). This geometry is created when someone cuts the 3+1 cone down into two 3+1 dimensions - this is known as a "reflection of the cone" - creating two points on the opposite sides of the cut.

This is all extremely abstract math that can be applied to any geometry. For example you could use this mathematics to define a 3+1 manifold: this would represent a collection of cones that are all intersecting each other with their common boundaries.

## Honest Game Design

To better depict how an entity would move through certain dimensions, imagine an object of the size of a normal person standing on a planet! From its perspective, the planet would be the same shape as our 3D world - but from the perspective of the object on its other side the planet will look like a tiny hill. The planet would also appear to be curved relative to the object's other side due to the presence (or lack thereof) of mass/energetic fields.  The only way to differentiate the two sides of the planet would then be by how your mind interprets it, or what colors it draws.  Since we're all human beings, we can easily assume colors to be the primary indicators of physical qualities - say blue for the surface of the planet and red for its inside. We should also be aware that the color of the planet can change as it traverses different dimensions - a red planet can turn white as it is traversed by a blue planet - it is a very powerful illusion that we humans can easily construct.

Now imagine the object is traveling between both of these sides while holding on to space-time with its two hands. It can no longer describe its position in Space and Time at any given instant. You can however, infer its position based on its color, the color of its hands, or other characteristics - it's still at some point in Dimension X, but the nature of that position is being determined by how you make sense of it and what objects you are aware of in this or that dimension. You think, "Whoa, the planet isn't actually curved!" Well I think your brain is probably confused that a curved object is actually at rest in one dimension while an object that is at rest in two dimensions would be curved. You may recognize this as a subtle difference between an object's location in Space and Space itself.

So, if we have a simple object floating in space and time then we should be able to distinguish between the two sides by how we use our physical senses to make sense of things. However, even without our physical senses being involved, many things will still fail to provide us clear signs of a surface's curvature. We see red circles as solid circles, things that are at rest in Dimension X as being flat, things that have been taken out of their own Dimension X as falling objects or mountains, and so on.

To make matters even more confusing about what the world really looks like when we cross it, let's consider the following scenario: a planet is slowly spinning around its own axis, and we observe a red solar sphere. While the disk rotates, we'll have to make sense out of the color changes that take place on the surface of this circular object - the color of a circle will change on its surface as the spinning planet pushes past it - or we'll assume colors vary on a sunspot with that circle surrounding it...

So if the surface of a planet is continuously circular as it rotates around it's own axis, how can we tell if we are looking south or west? Do we just need to pay attention to the color of this circle to tell? If so, then this is simply because we cannot see the color of light because it absorbs all frequencies of light...not cool or hot or white or red or anything...just see it, look around, and know!

So, if a surface is continuously circular, then why is it that the color variations on it would disappear after some time? 
Well, since the surface of an object can move around the center of the object in any direction, we can infer that there will be an arc on this surface on which the color will remain constant - this arc will remain on the surface the entire lifetime of the object (it could be smaller or larger, but the color will continue to appear as a horizontal line all the way up and across the surface). However, this arc can be created due to the fact that the circular rotation of the planet moves the center of this planet out of the way, creating a shift of the color along the surface of other points that were lying before the sunspot was rotating. We can also say that the arc will become vertical, as all the photons reaching its surface will pass directly through its center and appear to be on the same horizontal line with the colors (or lack of

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict mathematics, we need a more complete metaphor than the simple cube and triangle. That is to say, we need more than just a cube and triangle that are made up of points and lines. We need a whole system that lets us describe a number of different things in an easily understandable fashion, the more often we use it, the more naturally we can learn to use it, and the more easily we remember what it is we are trying to describe!

Well, there you have it! A more complete analogy to math than the simple ones mentioned in the previous chapter! Let's begin with the definition of a mathematician!

A mathematician is a person who is constantly trying to solve problems. For example, a mathematician could be trying to solve the problem of finding the circumference of the earth. This simple mathematical problem can be very difficult to solve without involving a computer - it involves doing a lot of calculations and using various math concepts to arrive at an answer - like how many points form a circle.

Now, why do mathematicians do this? Well, there are lots of reasons! Mathematicians solve problems because they have learned how to use their brains to solve difficult mathematical problems. They do this by remembering and using the math concepts and ideas that they learned at school or in their undergraduate degree.  To learn a math concept, we need it as a general concept. To remember a math concept effectively by "seeing what it looks like" is not as easy as we might think. In fact, when you "see what it looks at" you may start to forget certain aspects of the concept, perhaps because you cannot remember where things are defined. If you "see the things" - like when you draw a line - you may begin to see new angles and different shapes. If you can "see the concept at work" you may begin finding answers to math problems faster and more quickly. A mathematician can also use math to formulate more complicated questions - these questions are more difficult to answer and less easily understood. So they are solving problems because they care about solving them!

As we have seen in the previous two chapters, mathematics helps people solve problems and learn new concepts, but it is also an important skill that helps any person to improve their mental skills. We already established that mathematicians have a very strong memory that is related to their ability to use their minds as much as possible - so what exactly does this help us do that makes everyone different? Well according experts, it's that every person has particular cognitive abilities - which allows them to use their mind to solve and comprehend more and more complex problems - and all of these cognitive abilities lead us to a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, and to more efficient ways to use our minds to solve problems!

Now let's explore just a few different abilities that make us mathematicians. For every level of intelligence an individual brings to the mathematical field - and with each level, they are capable of performing more and more complicated mathematical problems - each of us has special characteristics to help us make it easier to remember and to use mathematical concepts!

Let's start with the mathematical concepts that are taught in college - these concepts have been known to help the person learn math faster. The most well-known way of teaching mathematics is to explain the math concepts in simple and concrete terms. You might say that some professors use this technique, but the truth is that most professors are very vague about the mathematical concepts they are teaching. Mathematicians are taught how to solve problems in a way that is less abstract and more focused on the elements of math that they need to solve the problems - rather than the abstract mathematical concepts.

Similarly, math helps people remember more efficiently. Every concept is related to a set of objects that are all parts of the concept. For example - one key concept of mathematics is division - which all concepts about division are related to. But the concepts of division also take us through an increasing degree of abstraction. So if we are trying learn division, we are learning something that uses the concepts of one more element after the concept in order to get a clearer understanding of them! In addition, we are introducing new concepts/parts of the concept for each level of division. Now there is a big difference between a concept being only part of a

## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict some of the many characteristics of the INFJ, we decided not to distinguish them based on any particular skill. Instead, we'll discuss only those things that distinguish them from the others. We'll do so in 3 parts:

An Introduction to Understanding the Inner Self
An Inward Perspective on Math and Life
The Inner Psychology of Math

A Brief Introduction to Understanding THEIR INWARD SELF

A brief explanation on inner psychology and the INFJ is useful since the INFJ's unique character comes from their very inner self - that's why the INFJ tends to be very insightful in a number of different contexts. So let's see what exactly the INFJ and the other three groups differ from one another. Keep in mind that we're using an anonymous, neutral, and not necessarily scientific approach here. But in reality, these three groups really aren't entirely different!

An INFP is a highly insightful, self-reflective, and intuitive person. In essence, they see things from different angles, think about things in other ways, and understand life from different perspectives. All of this is best expressed through their mathematical abilities. Math is a powerful way for them to make sense of their world, as well as to reflect on and explain the world in general. And, as an INFJ, these insights are often in the form of mathematical patterns, mathematical formulas, or more general types of concepts. In these types of "mathematical language," the INFJ often reveals their true feelings about the world and their feelings about life.

As we've previously mentioned, the INFJ has a keen sense of intuition and empathy. This skill, in combination with their excellent mathematical abilities, allows them to see clearly and express their true feelings in more visual and graphic ways. And, their mathematical ability often allows them to perceive the real situation and predict where this will lead - or even just what the outcome will be. This insight helps them make better-informed decisions about life and life decisions.

An INFJ also possesses high levels of math competence (i.e. they are good at mathematical thinking skills). This in turn is essential for the INFJ to understand their inner feelings. They also use their mathematical strengths when it comes to communicating - this is especially true if they are communicating with someone who isn't in their immediate environment. In this case, the mathematical formula and pattern can prove useful for communicating their feelings to that human being. This is why, for example, when someone says to an INFJ that they "love this guy in his class" or "that feeling about this event" can serve as a way to communicate a deep, internal feeling to another. This is also why an INFJ will sometimes use mathematical formulas (or just any kind of mathematical language) when trying to communicate their real feelings about the situation to a human being. Of course, this communication will usually follow a long explanation of the math formula into the human mind - the person will need to spend some time trying to understand what the math does before they can relate to it.

Another characteristic of the INFJs is that they are able to create new and improved ideas. This can help them navigate through life and cope with an ever-changing world. This ability to create new ideas allows the INFJ a great deal of flexibility in their behavior and actions. This flexibility is especially important when the INFJ feels that life is constantly changing. This makes the INFJ more adaptable, and allows them to respond to the changes easily.

An INFJs also has a very strong ability to think in abstract ways - or as we often call them intuitive thinkers. This allows them to understand complex situations much better than the other groups. Additionally, they are able, without much effort, to put themselves in other people's shoes and think about how other people might feel about the same situation. They can see things that go unseen and understand scenarios that go unexplained. They can also predict the future rather well - just like we know from our experiences that people who are old can make predictions about the future without consulting an expert. This allows the INFJs to know how things will unfold and predict how they will behave under varying circumstances.

To help understand what it means to be a genius, we have created some very simple tests

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the nature of "intelligent quotient" and "deities" - I will describe them as mental and physical abilities respectively. The "intelligent quotient (IQ)" is defined as "average intelligence within a given population from a given age and within a given society". We know from a large number of research studies that people with higher IQs live longer and healthier lives than people with lower IQs. However, there are other factors known to impact IQ too - for instance people with more religious beliefs have higher IQ levels - well that explains that one.

In mathematics, as we have seen in the last part of this chapter, intangibles (like concepts) can play a crucial role in determining mathematical results. In other words mathematicians use intangibles to make sense of mathematical calculations. This intangible - and also mysterious to many people - concept in mathematics becomes quite apparent when we go to study the behavior of physical particles moving through different types of dimensions.

Let's take a simple example of how an intangible can determine a mathematical operation. Let's say you are calculating the area of a rectangle - one of the many types of intangibles that make up mathematics. Let's say, for instance, you have four sides and you have drawn a line down the middle of these sides (we will call this line S). Now imagine that you have a line N along the opposite side of your rectangle. Now if you consider S and N as your sides and your center as your middle point, then the area of your rectangle would be equal to the area of N times S.

Now let's imagine that you consider S as your side and your center (N) as your perpendicular line to your side and you draw another line A parallel with this perpendicular line S (remember that we are applying a "parallel" to a geometric object in 2D geometry, whereas we are applying the "parallel" in three dimensional geometry - we will be using that later on).  Now let us consider that line A as your perpendicular to your side N and consider N (line N) as your mid-point.  The area of your rectal area in this calculation would be equal to: A * S ** 

Again, this example can be applied to any number of intangible concepts - for example the concept of area or line or circle or whatever is used to define what mathematically would have the same result as the above area expression. In general, if we know a geometric shape (either straight line, circle, or rectangle) and we can measure its length, width, height, and area, then we can use these measurements to calculate the area of any other shape that can be defined in exactly the same form.

For instance, consider the rectangle ADEDEDE, defined by the perpendicular lines A and E at the top and bottom and the inner diagonals at the sides, respectively (i.e. ADEDE = (BEEABEE + EEEEEE) 1/2). Then we know that the area of the rectangle is A * B * √ D (in this case we are using a geometric definition of shape area).

So to determine the area of this rectangular shape, we could simply make use of the geometric definition of area, calculate B and C, and multiply by D/2. In other words: 
ADEDEDE = A * √ B * √ C
This is the basic form for intangible concepts in mathematics. In other terms, intangible objects make it possible to manipulate and understand mathematically complicated structures.

Now let's consider deities - a very odd and bizarre type of intangible which we might not otherwise have thought of when discussing mathematical concepts. However, deities aren't just entities that have no other attributes, but objects that are created for a given purpose - they are special entities which have a unique name which tells us a lot about who or what they are.

The name(s) given to deities generally tell us a lot - in terms of the people who created them, their purposes, the places or events they were created to represent, etc. This means that some intangible objects have a very distinct name, while in many other cases these deities have very similar names (for example, the name "Capricorn" could describe any constellation

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our thought process, we can create a simplified version of our 3+1 space-time. Let's imagine that all our physical space, time, and objects we see in 3D (and all the other objects you can see) represent our thinking processes. It's quite easy to see why...


Note the 3D objects along the middle of the picture at the intersection of the x, y, and z axes. The red objects represent particles traveling towards us, the green ones represent particles traveling away from us, and the purple objects represent particles which are completely off of their world - such as the particles that fly around the stars or the astronauts in space! This view of what happens to our thoughts in 3D space allows me to simplify the presentation a lot, but it doesn't give any idea as to how our thought processes can be used to actually solve or explain puzzles in other dimensions....

Let me say a few words first about how the concept of thinking processes - and the many different theories they can be explained in using - relates in particular to the understanding of geometry and math. In particular there are lots of theories about how to understand problems in geometry and math and how to solve them using a variety of mathematical methods. As you know, from the first chapter we explained the basic rules of geometry and how they impact the way in which we deal with the world around us. Now in this chapter we are going to explore the similarities between the mathematics of geometry and mathematics in general. I will explain in more detail to which extent an entity can or should learn some of the mathematics of a particular phenomenon in the world.

For now, the more important idea to note is the following - no matter what dimension we are speaking of, there are common mathematical structures that are fundamental to the representation of our mind. For instance, if we wanted to explain how the concept "supernatural" works in a 3D or 4D universe - and how humans are affected by other dimensions - it's very common to assume that all three dimensions have some sort of intrinsic characteristics that can explain the concept of "supernatural". This gives us an idea of what our mind is made of, and tells us how it can help us understand what's happening around us! The basic idea is that our mind is a mathematical representation of what we think and the world around. Because each entity has a unique mind, it is impossible for an entity trying to understand something in a different dimension (such as understanding an odd number and counting it) to accurately do so.

Now on a separate note from the previous chapter, there are other common structures that are used both in 3D and 4D spaces to represent different aspects of human existence and their behavior. First off, if we looked at a 4D video of the stars, we would see that it's a fairly natural approximation to what we see on the outside of the stars. Why? Because objects in 4D:

Are also composed of layers of different colors and shades - that's why they don't look purple as they do in 3D

So if we were to draw something that looks like an actual 4D sky, we would use a lot of the same geometric formulas to calculate the properties of the colorful objects that make up our environment, and would then draw a picture that is close to reality.

However, if we take a similar line of reasoning and ask ourselves if there is any biological significance to the colors of any of this colorful objects (or to the "color" of any of the planet systems we are located in) we would realize that they are simply objects with certain properties that we can think of, but that have no biological significance whatsoever. In particular we'd realize to which extent this mathematical model could be used to classify, or find the cause of, everything from our stars to the different planets we see around us! We should also realize what the mathematical structures inside our brains are based on - as explained in the previous chapter. This gives an important hint concerning how to better understand some of the mysteries of the mind.

For now I'll leave you with a final note before I continue. Although we do not yet have access to the body of a 4D star, I believe that the body would have the same basic shape and function as any 2 dimensional object: energy and

To better depict the mathematical ideas behind the work that ISFJs do, consider the following two pictures:

As you can see the work that these students do is not a straight-forward computation. They use multiple algorithms, a form of mental algebra that includes both basic arithmetic and the principles of logic. And while most of their mathematics comes from traditional subject materials, this particular set of materials has been developed specifically to help ISFJs, rather than students in general, learn this type of math.

It's important to note that the concepts behind these lessons are very far removed from our daily lives. In fact, most of these mathematical concepts are beyond the realm of real-world understanding.  What we are learning in these lessons is how to think and solve problems in mathematics in a way that is more intuitive than what we typically think is possible. What is also interesting here is that these concepts are not considered to be "extraordinary" or "unnatural" - these children are learning ways to think about and solve problems that are very different from traditional ways of solving problems. In fact even the name "math" itself connotes an understanding of mathematics that is quite different from our current thought structures - rather than just the usual operations such as addition and subtraction, these children are working in the area of "compositions" and "concentration".

However, even though we are being taught new things in these lessons, we are still not teaching them exactly how to think about problems in the real world. We still aren't helping them understand how problems should be solved in a way that's easier to comprehend than traditional approaches and the underlying principles behind it. And in fact there are certain concepts in these lessons that are quite different from the usual thinking patterns in the math classroom. Perhaps even more interesting, the children in our class are also learning ways to analyze a problem and solve a problem in a new way...this is really quite impressive!

What is even more impressive is that we have been able to produce results that are comparable to and far from our traditional standards and the math curriculum at the secondary level, using methods that are entirely different.

To show how the concepts that the children learn in this particular set are vastly different from our day-to-day experience in the classroom, consider the work that the students did when taking part in this set of lessons in the spring of 2005. For more background information on this particular set, check out this presentation by the authors of the project:

http://mathnet.ed.ac.uk/course/ISFJ/ISFJMathematics.pdf

Although these lessons and the approaches they are using are different from the methods we are used to in the second grade, they are still quite similar to the way that we teach them in the class. Since these lessons are more sophisticated than what we are used, we have also found it's much easier to follow, comprehend, and apply the lessons than most of the work we have done before.

Here is a sample of what this paper contains:

There are a few methods you can use to measure mental abilities.
One method is using a standard standardized test - usually the Reading Ability Battery. The advantage to this is that you are able to compare results quickly. It's also the kind of test that is included in most public education programs. The disadvantage is that one is likely to fail to distinguish a person's intelligence from other related abilities if the test is used. But with the test that I have used here, the differences are very clear. Here is an example of what is reported.

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what we are doing here, and how we might use mathematics to solve problems, let's divide all our tasks into categories and consider them as different aspects of cognitive functions. In this next chapter we will cover the categories that we are going to discuss first and then cover the specific mathematics that is used for solving these problems. Let us remember to use caution...you don't have to know every math rule for every task but this can help you become clearer in coming up with solutions for specific problems!

First, let's consider cognitive functions as a category...it seems that there are many ways to see it, but we can summarize them as:

The ability to think about what we are studying and work on the task at hand.
The ability to make short, concise decisions about what to do and what to try to do.
The ability understand and interpret what the teacher and the teacher tells them.
The ability of recognizing visual images that the teacher has prepared.
The ability for working with symbolic and mathematical ideas.
The ability and desire for learning something new.
The ability through creativity to come up with things that help us solve problem sets.
The ability or ability to think critically about the information being presented, to reason, to evaluate, and to try to determine whether the information you are processing is true or false.

With these categories in mind we can think about each concept and its relationship to other concepts.

Cognitive functions can be considered as a group of problems that are different from each other in terms of type, structure and context. For instance, we are going discuss different strategies that are used in solving mathematical problems. The following five types of problem are taken from a textbook that I will be using to illustrate this concepts:

Find what the problem says.

This is a basic problem type. It has a one and only one possible answer: the answer is found and presented to the student.

Find the best way to solve this particular problem.

This is also a basic problem. It has two answer options: an algorithm/method can be identified and the student/learner will try to use that method to solve the problem.

Find the simplest method of solving this particular problem which leads to the best result.

This is similar to the find answer category. However, instead of looking for the best way of solving the problem, this is a way to look for a simpler solution which is the most efficient. The student/learners will be trying to keep the problem as simple as possible while still identifying and performing certain computational tasks.

Find a best solution which meets all the conditions required.

This kind of problem can be very challenging to students/learners/teachers. The student will have to find the most efficient way of solving a mathematical problem. The teacher/learner might have to give a specific amount of time to the problem/problem set to be solved so as to allow the student/student to get a better understanding of how to solve the problems on their own. In addition, the problem may have different conditions (e.g., the teacher might have given the student certain mathematical constraints which are related to the problem at hand).
There are four ways to solve this problem

Try to find the solution by analyzing the mathematics involved in the problem.

Try to use the solution to find a way of solving this problem by applying rules and techniques such as simplifying, making a simplification as a first guess or looking at special mathematical situations which can be solved in a similar way to make certain conditions satisfied.

Try to solve the condition by first formulating the conditions.

Try to find a solution by using mathematical equations to determine an algorithm and to try the algorithm to find a number of potential solutions which can be used to solve this condition.

Compare and find the most significant difference in the solutions of the two conditions or whether they are equivalent and therefore identical for the solving process.

Using the problem to decide on a procedure to solve the mathematically based problems.

This is one of our favorite problems. If the question is of a simple math problem type, the student/teacher will likely find an easy solution using the simplest algorithm/solution the problem is set to.

Using the question to find the conditions which is required.

This is another very simple concept which is often encountered in solving problems for elementary and high school children. The question

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our relationship to God, we must first understand what a concept called "intellect" actually is. Of course we already know this, and I've even outlined the history that goes with these concepts in the previous chapter. But how does "intellect" really do what it is meant to do as part of our cognitive system? Will "intellect" make us more likely to think rationally, or will it limit our capacity to fully comprehend reality?

Nowadays, most philosophers believe that "intellect" is something similar to the "consciousness" that we use to think and reason in everyday life - in short, "intellect" has a specific role in our cognitive system, and plays essential roles in a process that begins with our perceptual system (the outer layer of our awareness of reality) and continues with our reasoning system (the inner layer of our physical consciousness).

Of course, this does not mean that everything about God goes through "intellect" - instead, he seems to be part of the larger whole of our mind. The central tenet of the creation story, for example, is that God made all the seemingly inorganic elements as though they had intelligence. But in actual reality this is true for all of nature, and it is this intelligent part of the whole - like "happiness" - which guides us when it is time to pursue our goals of our existence as a species. This is the main reason that many philosophers believe God is at the center of our mind!

Now let's look back at our relationship with God as a little bit more closely...

What about the concept of "inner intelligence"? Well it's probably best to think of this concept in simple terms. It basically means that something within our conscience and thoughts is not just a bunch of random data, but is part of our higher powers for making informed decisions. For example, when we are angry, our inner conscience may decide to throw a stone at God...which is something we can't do directly on our own. We need to have someone else to guide our actions, and the "inner intelligence within us" helps us understand that person instead of just giving us vague instructions.

Now let's look deeper to determine how "inner intelligence can affect us in our thinking". To do so, let's draw an analogy between "inner intelligence and a fish".

According to the evolutionary theory, when the fish first came into existence, they were all living in the same large, cold aquarium that was filled with oxygen and water. But in a relatively short time, they were exposed to the outside world, and they quickly adapted to the conditions that were there. In time, humans came to live in this same large, oxygenated aquarium, and as a result almost everyone seems to possess higher levels of "inner" intelligence!

Now the fish were in perfect balance - having all the necessary supplies of oxygen and water and not spending any energy to hunt for food. However, in the long run they became fat, and they began to develop certain diseases that eventually led to their death. After that, the rest of the fish in the aquarium would not be as smart as the first generation, and they would grow "inner" in an attempt to gain control of the same conditions that led to their own premature death. As time went on, this inner intelligence would only increase, until it became a dominant power that was able to rule over all the fish in this isolated aquarium. 

Now, all the fish would be affected by this "inner intelligence," and it would affect the way they handled their environment. So the longer this "inner" power existed, the more they would be able to make better choices and act in the right way when faced with different conditions. Eventually this "inner intelligencer" controlled all of the fish, and in this way they would all be perfectly balanced and happy even in their little bodies.

This is why it is sometimes difficult for people to find their inner "inner intelligence"; they will not be able to fully comprehended this higher power that made them survive, and it will always be out of their reach. Of course, humans are not the only ones who possess this "inner intel"- it is present in many animals and plants and even in the world of lower dimensions

To better depict how the physical world works, we can view it as a graph, where each coordinate represents a particular physical property of a particle, while each edge represents a combination of these particles. 
Figure 1: (In this model, the particle A has three independent coordinates x,y, and z which represent the length of its particle, the angle of its particle with respect to the x-axis, and the angle of the particle with respect the y-axis respectively.) This graph depicts the particle with its three independent coordinates. As we can see in the figure, when the particle moves through time, the space between the axes goes along with the speed of the particle. This is a good example of the importance of dimension.

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the most important thing we can do is not listen to the lies that our government and corporate media are telling us about global warming. As the article below details, global warming will only worsen if we do not stop listening. It's also important to watch out for government-sponsored propaganda that is selling ideas to the community, such as the idea that we need to spend more on carbon-free appliances. The real problem that global warming is causing is the depletion of our natural resources. According to NASA, carbon dioxide accounts for 95% of all the gases that make up the atmosphere. Anything that comes from plants or animals is a source of carbon dioxide. In order to stop global warming from happening, we should stop using all those resources. If anything, we should be spending even more by building more plants and animals.
The most prominent problem with greenhouse gases is the fact that they are trapped in the atmosphere. Once released in the atmosphere, they are trapped there forever.  The only way for them to escape once again is to come out in the oceans or somewhere in Antarctica! The solution is that we need a carbon-free economy where carbon emissions are capped at 0 before they are taken out of the atmosphere. This will ensure that the gases only come from sources which have to be converted into electricity and gasoline, which are already used by industry worldwide.
This is the ultimate solution to stopping global warming! In order for us to get in on this new economy we have to change our ways of eating. We have to stop producing food in all but the safest areas of the planet, thus causing climate change. And if we aren't sure of what is really causing global warming and how it's affecting us when we eat, we can learn more about it by checking out Wikipedia!

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the way we think is our way of thinking. And the way we are able to understand the universe (as discussed in previous chapters) is based in our cognitive abilities. To be more precise, the way individuals analyze and interpret information (a concept first introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi) is part of how they conceptualize the world, how they understand self and how they interact with people and stuff in their own immediate environment. So one way to think about the power of cognition is to consider it as the capacity to process relevant information and think through the meaning of that information in a specific way. This is what we call intelligence.

Many individuals claim that their innate abilities to think well is a gift from God or that it just happens to everyone at birth. However, the theory of innate intelligence is fairly controversial, and one theory that is favored by scholars holds that intelligence can be learned. But there are studies that actually suggest that innate intelligence does not exist - it may only be that people actually rely on cognitive abilities that they get from experience instead...

So, how do we use intelligence to predict how people will behave? The standard way is by calculating one's MBTI profile. It's a popular and popular way to determine whether individuals come from a certain group (i.e., how smart they are) and thus predict their success.

Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are born with certain abilities that they must excel at in order to succeed. One such individual is known as the "MBA" – a person's ability to think analytically and use facts as a primary tool to make decisions.

MBAs think in logical ways and have excellent analytical skills. These people are adept at analyzing relationships between topics and come up with conclusions that may not be easy for people to grasp quickly. But they generally are a confident person who is confident in their own abilities.

What exactly is the MBTI profile? 
The MBTI personality profile is created based on data that researchers have gathered from participants in various experiments. The MBTI profile consists of 16 questions that are intended to measure a person's traits and functions using four categories: Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

Openness to Experience: This category asks whether an individual is interested in experiences outside their surroundings (e.g., traveling around the world, visiting new countries, learning new languages). If the results of this category are positive, this individual is likely to experience a variety of experiences. This trait is often used to predict behaviors and reactions to stressful situations.
Conscientiousness is the trait that asks to what extent an individual engages in tasks that are essential to their success (e. g., organization, time management, discipline). If the individual's scores are below the average, they are likely to engage in behaviors that can hurt themselves and work hard, but they don't take shortcuts. Individuals with higher scores tend to take shortcuts, so they can more easily accomplish a task or a goal...
Agreeableness is the trait asking to what extent the individuals are sensitive to feelings and emotions such as love, compassion, and empathy. People with lower scores are less likely to be emotionally attached to others and therefore have less capacity to be caring people. This causes them to have a higher risk of developing alcohol and addiction problems...
Neuroticism represents the last trait in the MBTI Profile. This group of questions is only intended (sometimes to) indicate if an individual has psychotic tendencies, but it is not meant to predict any particular behavior.
MBAs fall into one of four groups: High Openness to Experience group...
  High Openness Openness group (Og)-- high Openness
  High Openness Conscientiousness group (Oc)-- high conscientiousness
  High Conscientiousness Agreeabenness group (Ca)-- high agreeableness
  High Agreeability Neuro-Behavioral Disorder group (NBD)-- high neuroticism

So, how does a high MBTI profile actually impact the individual? The high Openness to Adventure and Experiences OCG group has the highest percentage of individuals who are high in confidence; the Openness

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict how this book will fit into the overall scheme of Seven of Sevens, we will be discussing the details of every single marriage in the book beginning with the marriage of Mary to Joseph on Baker Street in the first chapter of the book. But before we get into details, here is the synopsis of the relationship of Mary and Joseph. They were poor immigrants (who came to London to work on the nearby bridge over the Thames) who both started life as orphans and were both poor so when Mary died, he was the only child left to raise. The poor situation was really bad, so Joseph and his mother brought Mary into their world, and she grew into a sweet, thoughtful, and loving young lady. She eventually met and married a rich young gentleman called a carpenter named Blythe. Mary and Blythe eventually made it to America and eventually lived happily ever after, being the parents of nine children.

A:

It is so intriguing, yet impossible. Just imagine that a person is in front of you. You are thinking, "Oh, she is really really pretty.", and this person, you think, is standing on the floor! The question is: why do we think such a thing?  It is not possible to go up here and stand there in front of the person!  One of two things must be happening behind the person's back. Either she could be just standing there, and he could be passing through space; or (1) she must be in a big room, and (2) she can be there because she is standing there by her own invitation. The person would either have moved into one of those big rooms, or she would have come over through the wall.
Your brain uses certain mental associations to make sense of the physical existence of objects, and the physical existence (and physical characteristics) of people. If the object is in a room (as opposed to being outside of a room) then you have a "holding place" for the object and you can imagine her there. If it is outside of a window (as opposed a being in one outside the window) then the place where you can place it is outside the window, and you are going to move right over and into the window and get a view of the person, and imagine she is there. 
I think that if we had a person sitting in front of us, and we wanted to talk to her with our mind, we would need to move into the person's room with her! We would not be able to come in and talk to her without moving into her room. If we can move into her room, then we might be able to talk to this person - but then she would not be real and we wouldn't just see her in our mind, but in the real place of reality! And that is what would happen when we enter a room without having done it first, or at least not without a plan to move directly into the room without having to do so.
If someone has a room and you come in through the window and look down, you see nothing - only the window. If you try and move out through the window, you will have only a small window behind you. But suppose you go down to the bottom of the floor, and enter through the window you saw! It is like looking down into the darkest room of your mind - you see nothing. But if you go down at the other end of the floor - down to the first floor, and go into one of the rooms and just stand there instead of enter through the door, then you will see the person - but from that point your mind will be in the other room, and you would not be seeing the person directly - or, in other words, without knowing that you would see her. In other words - the problem is that you go into the room, and see her, and then you lose sight of the person - or, to put it in another way - the person is outside of your head, in your mind. That is why people don't just have to go up, and see a person, and then go back into their mind and say, "Oh, I see her!".
I think it's important to point out an additional problem you

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the complexity of the Maya religion, it's useful to first take a closer look at its main concepts. In this episode, we'll explore some of the most important concepts of the Mayan religion and how they fit in with the ideas of modern science and the evolution of human society. You may even be surprised!

According to modern science we know that the Maya culture predates the world known as Europe. This fact has been disputed by some scholars, but is indisputable for many scientists. The theory is that the Mayan civilization was invented thousands of years ago much before the civilization of the European countries. But what makes this theory true is not yet the subject of much scientific debate. But is it really so easy for us to understand all the concepts of the Maya, even without any advanced knowledge of their culture? Well, it's true that the Mayans had a very clear understanding of the concepts of time and space and how these concepts were intertwined; this knowledge allowed them to create a very clear image of what they believe to be the origin of the world. It seems to me that most of us would make vast simplifications in trying to understand the Mayan concepts/beliefs; they make tremendous assumptions and are highly idealistic.

As we move through deeper and deeper levels of culture, we begin to see that the Mayas would believe in many different kinds of entities. It's worth noting that the Maya believed in all different types of beings, just as we have. However, the Mayan society would also believe in higher and higher types of beings! But what was more interesting to the Mayans was the concept of "origin". In Mayan religion, the world began with everything that has ever existed; all the other concepts we learn about today are merely products of this earlier world. So it's even more amazing than you may think to realize that there were many previous worlds prior to this final one!

So why would it be important for a civilization to believe in "origin"? Well, the reason the Mayans did is pretty simple: this world is the result of a different world and so it has some sort of significance. From these beliefs it was easy for the Mayans to make the most out of their environment, and continue to prosper. And so it would be beneficial for them to try as many different things - be it astronomy or medicine - as possible so that they could continuously grow and prosper!

As we continue toward the future, I'm curious to know about the concept of death for the Mayan's. I have been told that death is believed to be a spiritual feeling that goes away when we die, while physical death is no longer necessary. Some studies have shown that death is something that is very real for the Mayas. But why would this be the case? If there were no physical death, then who would have to worry about how to preserve their life form after death? Obviously, this is the only explanation I can come up with! But can it be that the Maya thought it was important to think about death because they believed it was important for them to leave a legacy to their ancestors - even years after their death? So it would seem that they believed there is a certain significance to dying to preserve their survival.

So this final episode about the Maya, will let you see a more detailed view of some of the great concepts that make up their religious system. I hope you'll enjoy this episode as much as I have!

An Unusual Thing!

There has been a lot of speculation and debate about what could be the cause of a strange, sudden lightening and strange earthquakes occurring several times in a row across America and in several other countries. And recently, this activity has increased exponentially in the recent months.

After much discussion, there seems to be a consensus within the scientific community that this event was a form of natural science. However, there remains a great deal of speculation on why it occurred in such a large area. Some speculate that there could be a meteorological phenomenon, while others think it was an act of supernatural forces - either natural or otherwise.

As I was in the region the other day, I saw an unusual lightening activity occur across some areas of the Southwest. The lightning was so big

## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict our journey through Dimension X, we would like to think about our journey from the time we were born to Present Time. Let's consider the fact that we don't take an instant into consideration when we use equations to predict the path our physical world would take if we were to experience a change in our 3+1 dimensions (the world below us).

From the perspective of the world above us, this change in dimension is an event, and it doesn't take an instant until we experience it...unless a person is born into a totally different dimension and experiences the effect of the change! For example, the person who is born into the 5th dimension would experience the effect of coming to a different dimension for an instant!
One of the most interesting laws in Nature is that physical processes are inherently reversible! One of the laws that describes this is the first law of thermodynamics - the laws of nature do in fact work in reverse - that is, if you make a change in a system that is in direct contact with a heat-source, you will gain energy from the heat source! Even if the heat source is suddenly removed from the system's perimeter, the system will still have the ability to gain energy from said heat source by releasing the heated gas into the system's surroundings...at a later date (a subsequent time) the system will have the ability, in turn, to release that heat into the environment, in a manner that makes it as efficient as though the system is currently at rest.

One of the laws of thermodynamics that actually provides proof for our journey in Dimension X would involve the first law itself - that is if we took an instantaneous snapshot of the system we observe at the time we are standing in front of it, it would not be the same system we are currently standing against. That is, we would see no changes in the system! However, as time passes and our body undergoes physical changes, we would begin to observe changes in the properties of the system. For example, from our perspective, we would feel a certain amount of warmth on our back from a cold spring water...and then, as time passed, that heat source would gradually melt and heat up through the body. When we do this, our system would gain or gain energy, from the heat in the water and that energy would be useful in maintaining the heating of the system through time.

So, in short, time takes part in everything that happens in our world - all of the properties and forces inside the system will be continually changing (according to the laws of physics) and so will the system...at any given moment.

What would happen if you suddenly and without a second thought entered into Dimension X? Would you experience the effects of time dilations and time reversals? Could you gain or lose energy and gain (or lose) heat from a fire in a dimly lit room (if you were in the lower part of the living room rather than in Dimension X)?

Well, it's interesting to see how the world of physics handles these changes! What if we were somehow to make a measurement when we enter from the lower dimension in hopes of measuring time from our dimension?

Now this is where things get interesting! According to Stephen Feynman, physicist and mathematician, time is a fundamental concept of physics and it is impossible to measure time in an absolute sense. He proposed that a time scale exists that defines the "absolute" sense of time and that no single time measurement can ever exactly measure that time scale. In other words if someone said to you "The world is two seconds old", you wouldn't believe them. Feynman suggested that if we were able to measure the "speed of light in vacuum", we could tell the time because "that's the only thing that is measured by a standard clock at its precise time!" This time scale would also represent the "absolute sense" of speed in spacetime...something which Einstein had initially intended for his theory of relativity; according to his theory of gravity "time" and "space" do not have an absolute definition but rather the space-time which we experience in our everyday lives would be the "same" one...

As an aside, some physicists have argued that Einstein's theory is not a correct theory in the sense that it ignores that "speed

Yes, ultimately, the purpose of a spiritual seeker is to understand and grasp the mysteries of reality. As an entity, the purpose is to evolve our own consciousness and to learn about spiritualism and how it relates to our own existence.

## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the big question we are facing right here is, "What do deities really stand for?" (As mentioned before, the main characters are Deities, who are responsible for the existence of all things in this universe.) So let us first discuss what deities are, and then figure out how they fit the story....

Deities are essentially very good at remembering. They are able to mentally travel through the 3D world and look at their surroundings from different perspectives. To better make sense of the story, let's break down this very basic concept further.

Every thing in our world and its surrounding is made from energy! But what does this energy really mean in terms of physics? In other words; how can it possibly create its own energy without affecting other things around it? And besides...how's this energy generated inside of us when, for example, we think something negative? And what's part of energy that we don't know about at all?

Energy plays a very important part in physics. When someone thinks about any object in our 3D world, in the mind of that person, these objects have some energy "under their fingertips"; the higher the energy of these objects, the stronger their attraction toward other objects. Now consider two objects placed very close to each other - imagine two red hearts with the blood running inside them! Now imagine a black cat flying over them holding the hearts out to everyone - and wait until you see the cat's eyes move! This cat is using a very rudimentary form of energy, called gravity. The more gravity, or gravity, you exert, the more force the cat exerts on the red heart and heart blood. (You can use the analogy of gravity, which forces an object away from other objects to create a force, just like the red hearts' gravity acts to remove the blood from the red hearts, causing them to shrink to size again.) By pulling these two red hearts closer together, the cat reduces the force they exert on each other (because of gravity) to almost nothing (because the hearts are now very close together) and so has the cats attraction...

Now let's say someone really enjoys watching cats - and they are quite literal in their descriptions of cats by having a black cat lying on their front...or even better...a black cat standing on the floor! Then we are going to need another analogy for the cat - a cat sitting in a chair. While sitting, the human observer might notice that there is a dog in the chair - and now what? You can't possibly be watching a cat sitting on a chair with a dog in it if you want to watch it. That's exactly what deities do! They remember the 3D world from several perspectives, and they simply look at it from a different perspective than a non-simply-describing human observer. Instead of going to watch a cat sitting down, you can simply imagine yourself as a cat sitting cross-legged! This way, the cats will be acting on your position, which makes your gaze and body move in the space between the two cats - this is called'recreative dimension travel' - a very basic concept which could just as easily apply to humans! However, in this case, the cats are using something called "funeral dimension travel" to enter you in the 3D space-time...and you don't see anything! The cats are using the same concept of'recreative' dimension travel, but this time they are using 'funeral' time travel to travel through the 'failed dimension' and enter your body...!

Now let's look at a more advanced example. Imagine you are sitting in a large office building with a large TV on its wall, a large book with one large picture on it, a couch, a chair (which is not a chair, just an ergonomic desk), and a lot of desk chairs around you - and here is where we come into a technical concept...

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict or illustrate a particular thought or situation, scientists have invented a number of techniques to help you visualize the idea in your mind.  One of the simplest and most effective methods is for the person to draw a picture. A picture can be an exact image, like the one below, or a more abstract and idealized representation of the scene. In reality, though, one can either draw the picture that most accurately reflects the thought it is about, or there is another way to look at it.  

The picture below depicts the idea "Spirit of Fire" (or "Spirit in Heaven") as it is pictured in the books of the Bible. In reality "Spirit" is not one of the principal ten personalities of the Lord. However, as we will see in the next chapter, this picture is used to describe specific types of spirits, such as "Spirit Light", and "Spirit Water".

The next thing to remember about how to draw a spiritual picture is that you always need to start with some basic facts about the person(s) you're imagining. This means that you'll need to know the names of their ancestors and any known personalities they possess, their birthplace(s) (or at least the city in which they were born, if not directly related to a family of priests), their position in the pantheon, and so forth. In addition, you'll have to remember how the people in the picture relate to each other and how the picture reflects the image of the figure in the person. Some pictured spirits must be in some way associated with one another to fully represent their individuality.

The basic idea behind using the picture is that it is a metaphor, which means it uses the characteristics of a picture to describe its object. The idea is that you need to remember the three fundamental characteristics of a person: the face, body, and soul. This will help you draw the picture the most accurately, but it also means you'll be able to more easily and easily identify the individual(s) being described! The goal will then become clearer - you know what you need to do and don't need to take notes - and any question can be answered.

In some religions, the picture itself (or a piece of artwork) will be used to depict the deity. This is a popular tradition that has actually become a religion in its own right. Here the picture is a visual representation that uses the artist's own vision of the deity to visually depict the particular god.

For readers unfamiliar with this tradition, here is a list of some of the most commonly used deities:

Deity Light - Ruler of the Underworld
Deity Water - Lord of the Underflow
Deity Fire - God of the Fire (Thunder)
Deity Wind - Wind God (Crow)
Deity Fire-breather - Fire God (Bee)

The main difference between all this and a "real" picture is that the person who was created to depict these deities does not actually have to be a real person - they can be replaced by some other character that has some of the features of a person rather than a real one.

What we're really talking about when we refer to the Deity or deity is the Person in this story. In other words - the person depicted in the picture. As we've seen that person is the one in Heaven or in Thoth. This person actually exists in the real world, just not as a physical, living human being. In reality the person that we created with the idea of the picture is not really related to us, and is not a real human being - just some abstract representation of our original, original spirit that we created from the very beginning.

As you can see, the image alone can't explain all the ideas we've been discussing - we need to include information about the deity in order to understand the picture in a way that makes up for the fact that the creator of the picture has not actually come to life to actually take part in the creation. This would be a lot easier if the creator of a picture could actually have known about this picture and the concept surrounding it, but unfortunately, not all deities and deities are created in

## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict the mysterious forces operating inside us, we might suggest using a functional programming language to do some programming, something like C++. This doesn't, however, make any sense! It would be extremely strange if we were being programmed using C++! In fact, we could go so far as to say that programming is a fundamentally wrong theory of reality - it is more about the mind than about the hardware! Here is how it works: The programmer (let's call him David) has developed code that allows him to predict the future and to determine the results of any action he desires to take...just as a computer does!

Now consider a single sentence that allows David to predict the behavior that will occur in the next ten minutes:
void DoAction() {
  double x = 42; // x = 42 is the number I need to predict in future time
  double y = 42;
  y = (x + 5.4) / 6; // y = (1.21 + 1.5) / 6 = 42
  cout << y << "\t"; 
}

This sentence simply determines the numbers 42 and 6 in the next 10 minutes using the values from the equation y = (1+5.4)/6.
Clearly this program performs correctly - even if it is run over million or trillions of times, the numbers it predicts will always be the same. However, it has so many flaws that the programmer has no choice but to continually rewrite the code to maintain the correctness of his program, and he eventually stops! It is so easy to fix a program like this, that we would be surprised to find that over 1 billion programmers have used it in their life!

Now consider an even better example of a functional programming programming language:
void GetX() {
  int x = 42 & 0xF; 
  x = (x ^ 1) & 0x7; 
  cout << "x = " << x << std::endl; 
}

Clearly this also produces an error message, as far as the programming language is concerned. Why is this language so good at predicting the future? It is because at compile time, code that reads a string of the form "x = x" is assumed to read the whole expression "x = (x & 0xF)". This expression, however, has exactly one AND operator, and the compiler translates it to the following:
int x = 0xF + 1;   
int x = x + 0x7;  

This is equivalent to the following:
  int x11 = 0xF; // x11 is the last digit of the expression "x = x11 + 1"
  int x22 = x11; 
  x22 = (x11 ^ 1); 

  if (x22 == x11) 
     // x22 = ~x11 would otherwise appear to be true
  else
     // x11 == ~x11 which doesn't appear to be "true or false"
  {
     x22 = 0x7; 
  }  

So the compiler (and the programmer) has used the "and" operator in the code to replace the original "x = x & 0xF"; with the correct "x = (0xF+x11) & 0x7"; expression which is equivalent to a statement written in our functional programming language:
  int x33 = x22 & 0x7;  
  x33 = (x22 ^ 1) | (x21 << 13); // and x11 << 13 is used instead of | - it does not affect the x33 because "~x" returns the value 1
  x33 = 0xFF & 0xF; // 0xFF is the 0th digit
  x33 <<= 13; 
  x33 = 0xF & 0xF;  // 0xFF is added to x33
  cout << "x33 = " << (const char **)& x33 << std::endl; 
};

As you can see, the compiler has generated code that reads an expression "x = ", and then converts it to its equivalent "x = x& 0xF" by using the AND function and the 0xFF to convert it back to an int.
Now let's turn our attention to some more complicated code. Suppose we wanted to make a recursive function to predict the next 15 minutes. Let's call this function recursion:
  int recursiveGetX(int x) { 
  return x & 0xF;

## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict the way mathematics and the ideas behind the sciences intersect, physicists use the word "apprentice" to distinguish between those that have a training in physics as a student but no real knowledge of how that field is actually working in reality. This is similar to the example of a teen that begins working at a bakery after learning a bit of baking and only then realizes that cooking stoves and cooking pots are really just electric warmers...


The Apprenticeship of Philosophy

A similar process of gradual education is also used to describe the learning philosophy of certain philosophers. The phrase "apprentices into philosophy" comes from an ancient Greek philosophy of the city of Plato, which defines philosophy as a "slippery and difficult walk."
The term "philosopher", on the other hand, comes from a period in the history of Western philosophy where many people considered themselves as "philosophers". These scholars were often called "philosophers," whereas these philosophers in the medieval era sometimes referred to themselves both as philosophers and scholars. Today the term "philosophist" is used to designate a person who wants to study philosophy.

One of the most important of these apprentices into philosophy is Plato, who received his education as a student of philosophy at a school, but he was unable to become a serious student of the academic discipline for one reason: not knowing how to apply the ideas and theory taught at school in his own life. In order to learn and apply the ideas developed by Plato, he worked with his friends in order to understand and apply his own ideas in his world. He then discovered how his own ideas and thought processes were wrong and he tried to correct those ideas and think processes by changing his own ways of thinking.

From this lesson we can learn at least three things: 

Plato's goal was not to become a philosopher, but rather to be a philosopher himself. 

Plato's inability to learn and teach philosophy did not mean that he was unable or unsuitable for the job. His friends and his contemporaries noticed that he was not just an intellectual who had an intellect, but instead a very good understanding of the concepts and ideas in order to help apply these ideas to different situations.

Plato was eventually able to become a good student of philosophy by applying the teachings of Plato to his own life as well as applying the theory developed by Plato to different societies. However, he was unable and unsuitable in order to teach others about Plato's thought processes and thoughts, despite being able to relate his own ideas to Plato's way of thinking - which is a very useful thing because it helps people to understand our own thought processes properly.

The Appronticeship of Science

Another important element in Plato's apprenticeship into philosophy, is the notion of an apprentice into science. Plato's philosophy is all about the study of theories and mathematics. After completing his studies and learning philosophy, he worked on the problems that arise when applying these theories and mathematics in his own real life. For this example, we can only come up with one word that is appropriate - "science". If for example we had talked about the science of math, then we would be talking about a student that was studying math at a school but who was unable and unaware of how math works in his own lifetime.
For most of Plato's life, his apprenticeship continued as he continued studying different branches of science, but never mastered all of them and never could become a serious teacher of each one. This is where the idea of science becomes relevant - he would only be capable of mastering a very limited number of sciences at a time and never be able to truly understand the whole science of each part of the sciences. He would study a few areas at a time, but would never be able fully understand the whole idea of a given branch of science!
Another notable example of a schoolboy that does not achieve that level of scientific understanding is the famous philosopher of Stoics Socrates.  Socrates was a student of Socrates at a school where he learned the foundations of scientific ideas. He taught other people about Socrates' philosophy as a mentor and guide, yet his students eventually learned less than he could

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict the mystical, surreal, and mysterious power of the Meadow Mage we will use a metaphor of a mountain. While this mountain could stand on its own, it wouldn't be very interesting.
The Meadow Mages, like all other elves and wizards in the area, wear the Meadow Brim. This is a white, magical leather-like armor worn over their entire body and that covers them from head to toe. It's the protector of the spirit world, but not just yet; it also acts as the shield of the magical kingdom as well. The only thing that is lacking is the sense of smell...something that is very important in all elves but particularly in Meadow Mage folk.
So we can see that the Meadows Mages use their magical power differently than everyone else in the area. They're able to smell and move through the air, but they're not able to take in magical energy from the atmosphere.

Let's now return to the scenario, and imagine a Meadow Mage travelling among mountains in the area surrounding Windurst. So we see how the Meadow Magoe is able to see and smell different things in a natural atmosphere versus a vacuum, and that's how he can smell out mystical things like dragons; he could even make his way down into the ground to observe and capture the energy of the soil.

What makes everything so easy however? Well this is exactly what happens to all good magicians - the meadows are magical places! They're full of magical energy and all sorts of other creatures as well...the earth, a land of fertile fields, is full of magical energies that are extremely powerful. It's only one trick in the book, so naturally things start to take shape when you find yourself in one of these amazing places! Well this is not quite so easy for the Meadow Magician, as the Meadow World is so much larger than the rest of all of the magical lands in the universe!

So what are the chances of anyone encountering a Meadow World on Earth? Well first of all, we have to look at what happens to magical energy when you have to move through a vacuum. There are several mechanisms through which magical energy can pass through through space-time to different places. First of all, because magical energy is a kind of "matter + antimatter", its passage through vacuum can be quite powerful. Let's discuss three mechanisms of how energy moves - all of the mechanisms will help explain how this magical energy is able to cross through different dimensions. 

A:

You are right, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to navigate through the space that is between two or more dimensions. The only person that can do it is a deity. If one of us finds one of these in time, it will be of little use since it will have been corrupted. One can argue that it would be useless to go on, since one of the reasons humans would want to enter a higher dimension is an attempt to explore the mysterious dimensions. There are many deified beings in one of the different levels of existence.
In any case, there is no means of actually exploring a higher-dimensional universe.
EDIT: A few words on the Meadow Universe, if it exists.
This world exists somewhere between the Meadow and the Sky Worlds. It is located in-between both worlds as they are both inhabited by magicians and sorcerers. This fact is evident even though it is located in between them in higher dimensions. The two worlds are much smaller than the Meadow, if not smaller than the Sky World; there is no visible difference between the two.

A:

As I remember, the world of deities (also known as "dark side", or "other side", in some translations) is actually hidden in the same universe as the Meadows, because the sky world has many more advanced technology and creatures than the Meadows. And the world of magicians is a lot more interesting, though.
From the story:

If the Meadow's core, or the central part of the Meadows were found to have been destroyed, that would make a major problem for the Magical Realm. The Magical Realms are the most powerful entities among all of creation. There are also many of

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the only thing that matters in life is what's in front of you. And the only way I really want to see life is as it was. If I can understand that, I can start to see it differently.
The final major topic in this chapter will be about higher dimension research in the hopes that it will give us an understanding of how we can use higher-dimension research in order to change the way we view reality and the world around us.

Here is an example for why some people might find it helpful to use higher-dimensions to better understand their environment. Suppose a group of researchers is working to develop a device that would be able to detect the presence of a certain toxic substance in a person's air. It is well known that most toxic substances cannot be detected by the human eye, unless the person is in a high concentration or is wearing a face mask.

But suppose someone or more are working in a lab and suddenly find a substance in the person’s air that they were not aware of before, only to realize that the person's air was contaminated with the substance. Now suppose that they decided that it was important to determine the amount of the substance so that they could make the right decisions for the health of the person...

After all, most of the research efforts are usually focused on the research and development of devices, and the detection of harmful substances to improve living standards are far less important considerations...or are we?

So the answer is that although it would be very important for those working on this device to take into consideration human health, it would be much more important for the device to consider the health of humans. If we use higher-dimentional research to ensure the device is safe, then hopefully it will be less likely that the device will be used to damage the population.

Finally, I'd say that the use of higher-dimensional research in this case is important because it allows us to better determine how and why a particular substance is found in someone’s air - which could then be the basis for making decisions regarding the health of that person, or more importantly, the total human population. So using the right higher-dimensional research can potentially help to ensure that we are preventing future diseases through prevention - or as the case may be, by using a less toxic or even less harmful substance in the future.

Of course, we're not the only ones out there that find it helpful - it just so happens that the author did, when he was a teenager. When he first took the class on advanced thinking, he was extremely skeptical of the class material - but after a few weeks of intense study and research on advanced thinking topics, he was able to understand a lot more!

Chapter Thirty Seven
The World of the Otherworlds

The final major question of this chapter will involve examining the World of the Others in order to understand what it is that causes others to go through what they do and how they do it. The first thing most people will probably be interested in is the differences that can exist between our own and the world of the others - where humans live, how they eat and in what manner of life they live. 

In this case, the world of humans is considered the world's largest place. Everything to do with humans and their environments will become a topic for future investigation. But this is not the only place humans live - there are worlds of animals and plants that also interact with humans.

This is a topic that a lot of people don't seem to want to discuss, and there are a decent number of reasons for that. The first one, and the simplest to explain, is that the world of animals and humans are not directly intertwined: there is no common language to talk about those worlds. So what you would think is common sense to your world doesn't seem to be the same for other worlds. Even if you have a shared understanding between our worlds, there might be certain things that are very different and you don't necessarily have the same knowledge about what they are. If you find that you know a lot about something, you might not assume the same knowledge doesn't exist for that same thing in other worlds!

But on the other hand, the world in another dimension is usually thought to be better equipped to deal with things that people
