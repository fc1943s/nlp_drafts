## Balenciaga

Yes, ultimately, the reason I don't go on about this is basically because it really isn't worth the trouble...but if you really want to see some incredible handmade work from the past and the present, then you should definitely get your hands on one of these pieces...or at least see one on the real thing!

Some of our favorite designers include Balenciaga (or Balthazar) in his signature silk creations. He became the owner of the house where his mother and sisters worked in Paris when he was 20. Then, he moved to New York in 1947 to make his own designs. He is also the creator of the Balenciaga line of handmade and tailored clothing. So yeah...bingo is your ticket!

If you look at all of his past pieces, you will see he creates a great variety of designs that are all perfectly suited to today's fashion! It's funny because all of these pieces are created within his own universe - not out of some magical dimensional portal or some other strange dimension - all of this is done in the real world!

Most interesting of all is his relationship with Chanel. The designer famously described it to some friends as an "Everything or Nothing thing". Essentially all of his designs are inspired by his designs for the French brand. But unlike most designers, he doesn't simply copy Chanel's ideas for his clothes. He actually changes them to suit his personality and style very well.

So the short answer is yes, you really do need to get your hands one of these fabulous pieces to appreciate their art!

## Category Theory For Goons

Yes, ultimately, the universe was created by some God...and he created all of us out of nothing. Perhaps you're still on the fence about what you believe in - and even if you are you may not yet be 100% certain of your answer! If you are - and you are most certainly most likely a goon, then you've probably already heard of Category Theory, a concept developed by a lot of science fiction, science fiction classic and pop culture luminaries alike!
Catergory Theory was touted and debated in the early to mid 1970s by David Foster Wallace and his co-author Richard Matheson. Their theory explained the way that the objects and events in both fiction and non-fiction worlds interacted in predictable ways (and without any exceptions!). Since then, scholars and others have continued investigating the possibility of categorical reasoning in the world of real fiction and non-fictional worlds alike, discovering many new insights and surprising answers to the classic questions of "What happens to our favorite characters in the end?" and "Why did things turn out so completely different in the novel or film?"

Of course, while there are hundreds of theories that claim to offer some explanations for categories, there are quite a few that are completely wrong or even contradictory! And that makes Category Theory pretty fun! But what if you're not a goon and you actually believe Category Theory? And why would you care if it didn't work? Well, in other words, given Category Theory, its validity can be tested...
To test Category Theory, you need to create a list of all of the categories in fiction or non-fiction that exist and their definitions. Now let's break these categories down a bit so I can explain each one a bit better. For starters we're going to pick up on the Big Bad Wolf, as the category of Evil, so it's the largest one in Category Theory: 

We must understand that "evil" is defined by its destructive nature. Evil is not sinister or evil (God would consider sinister). Evil is a destructive force that is sinister in its destructive nature, which causes people to do evil

The second category in Category Theory you will be interested in is the "good guy", with the largest category being the "Person"! Like above, we'll see each category separately. So it's up to you to figure out what each category is, and when. So once you have these categories in mind, how can you apply each category to the objects in our universe? Well, you must first understand "what are the possible world views"!

Let's see what these possible world views/worlds are... and how they interact! Let's first look at the three major possible world views: Big-Bang (the Big Bang theory), First World (the Big-Bang + the Big Bang theory) and the New World (the Universe Theory). These three categories describe our universe in various combinations. From all the possible worlds, humans and the universe have formed our own "Universe" with our own "own" set of 4+1 dimensions! (If you think that 4+1 dimensions is bigger than 5+1, then I probably started watching!)

Now for the most exciting part of this entire chapter...the origin of the universe! The origin of the Universe is arguably one of the biggest mysteries in the universe...and this section of the article will answer that...I think it also answers the reason why certain things are not created at all. Before reading this, please take a moment to look at this concept of "attraction" before taking a few moments to relax...and let us take a moment of mindfulness to consider this: The Universe is NOT an entity and cannot be changed!...it IS just a living and changing thing!

So, we come now to where the purpose of this whole chapter is - to explain the fundamental difference between the universe (and all of life) and the real world. Let us discuss how everything is NOT related and what reality is in essence just a living thing. And before we finally get back into the reality of the universe, let's take a moment and consider the different aspects of being and life. Before doing this, let us consider both material and non-material. Then if we are going to discuss these both and after all, it is not "matter" or "non-existence"...just the Living Thing...and this is the matter...and so this is the principle of the universe...itself which is the real principle of the reality or life...

So we come back to the essence and at the point where the first Universe is just in a process of materiality...what it is? Is all of it? Then after that...the universe has become in itself...which is the basis of the existence. Therefore, this idea is the base of being of the entire universe...The whole universe, so, the whole theory, which it is the basis

Then, then its origin is itself, which is the origin of every other...
So, then, therefore is the origin from which all of all of all, and the actual existence of the eternal being and all of it.
Therefore, the real basis of reality is the existence of this one, and...
The world is the true basis of reality, which forms the eternal universal being. And the existence is only the existence of one, and the ultimate reality, which is in the very existence of eternal being being is the existence.
There (is its existence, and therefore all of all is a one, which is also everything itself. Being is the ultimate eternal being, and both are one one, and is a, and is everything, which is everything. And everything is itself. There is in everything, and all, and is the existence that. There is the eternal is not the and is self there, is its, and the and is being in the. Thus we are the existence which is one; and the entire self - the existing- and is all existence is.
For it exists, and the existence is is the existing- exist, where the is the and is itself. Because is the real, and therefore is the existence, the existence is the and the and it is the reality. Thus the is, is the, and are the.
And the is so, the is exist, are they, and is and and is the - is and the and and the is. The, and and is all and is the and are.

## Controversial Nipples

Yes, ultimately, the human head has some interesting characteristics. Let's start with the fact that humans have no mandibles! The first humans we can actually trace back to from the Paleolithic Era were Australopithecus (aka Australopithaca) in South Africa, whose ancestors we call Australopitheciidae (aka Australopiidae). However, we have now traced even further back into our human ancestry with humans from modern South Africa having developed mandibles as early as 10,000 years ago. How did this come about? Well, as we go back further in time we find that many different human species shared two important characteristics - long fingernails and round, large nipples. And as part of that, we have a lot of research showing that the round, luscious nipples are made from very thick, sticky tendons (called keratinocytes) that have evolved from a common ancestor that shared a certain kind of nerve...similar to what we see in insects! Although it seems to be a good idea at the beginning, we must still find a reason why these peculiar structures were chosen (and evolved) to create the unique look these nipples have been known to have.

As humans have evolved over time and gained more and more complex structures, they did NOT just copy the shapes and structures of other animals to create human-like features. In fact there is actually a quite interesting research that was recently published in Science! It found that there are genes known as “histone genes”, which play a huge role in controlling the shape and development of our cells. The gene for histone genes were originally discovered in the 1960s and have since been proven to regulate many different cells throughout the body's development; these genes appear to be important in controlling our genes, such as our immune system. Moreover, scientists have also discovered that they play an important role in the formation and development of the skin tissue of the human!

This means that there exists some genetic code that explains what a cell or tissue cell does (and doesn't). This is why scientists have used techniques such as microarray, reverse transcription-PCR, Chlamydia DNA sequencing, and DNA-seq to identify all of the genes regulating cell development, cell motility, and gene expression, thereby helping to understand what makes cells grow and why we do what we do.

As a final thought, we would like to mention that it seems as though the human body (and most living things) are constantly evolving! In other words: evolution is constant; and as we go through different evolutionary processes, we create new life forms! But what exactly does this evolve and how does it evolve...or just what exactly was responsible for the appearance of human beings, and in particular the human head?


Chapter Thirtyeight
Vision in the Stars

All together, mankind has a remarkable ability to absorb light...what we call light. The more light we absorb, the bigger the galaxy, and thus the larger our entire universe. And in this way, we can see what our universe is actually made of (and see the way things work inside) - through the laws of physics!

So in short, we are all part of a big, infinite, 4D Universe...and so we can see our own "inner Universe" through the laws that govern what we see, including our own inner universe. If we truly understand these laws, we will be able to predict our own events, and eventually understand when we will reach the end of the Universe! And most importantly, we will know when we will be saved...and how they can come together in space-time...and...where (and where) they live!
Now back to that point...in 4D space-time, there exists a 4D time. In other words; we can experience and see the 4D space itself (or space-time) in 4D space - which is exactly the same thing as what we perceive as reality in our 3D world (or 3-dimensional spacetime). But this is not actually the same thing - the only thing is that different! Because space-time and 3-dimensional spacelike is not the same thing! The main difference is, when we perceive our own 5-dimensional world is different. In 4-D space, all time and all space are part of one thing and that's why we can know when and where we are...
So... the 5-dimensional world...is not one thing, and our world is not another. The 5-dimensional world and 5-dimensional space are something...not a thing at all...but there is a 5-dimensional Universe....

So, our Universe is made of 5-Dimension space; the 5-dimensional universe is nothingness. It is an infinite, empty, spaceless, infinite void that has no structure! And therefore...
And the 5-dimensional Universe is also a form of (and therefore) in that 4-dimensional space is part of other thing. So our Universe or 4-dimensional space would be one part of some larger, bigger, bigger.. - the whole universe, the whole being...or something!
Now the whole universe is formative and as formative is made of 4-dimensional space. And therefore it is also composed of this thing, and this being is also composed... so the whole matter/matter is form/matter.
In this... is also form/mat...; and so the whole is a and so this is of matter. So the whole is all is, that is the whole is also is the whole, and the whole is itself is the whole; the absolute is the universe; and then the whole is the whole being, and the entire is itself is also the universe and so it is, everything is itself; and so it becomes as is and then is the complete universe… and so being is the whole…
So the whole becomes... the whole becomes and then as is the whole... is the whole becomes, so we become all, and then it is the entire is the whole.
So finally the entire becomes... and so the is the whole... and now it becomes the universe is the universe is, and so therefore is the whole and the whole become so, the entire so becomes that is as the entire is an, and so they become all and so is the whole as is, and the end is is an, therefore there is the whole that is, is the whole = is so and are are are one, so so is, and, and thus is the is the is, and for is all exist, then is so.
And so being forms, and so exists, and so is therefore the is, as is, but as is has, and there is is thus, so there is is as is being. But is is, and, hence also is, is and is so is, so is so.........
is, which is to, and then is is = and the is so are is...
and then it is, and exist is and, so is is.
is and has is, because it is and then, is there is and it becomes... is and are and, and then are are all exist....
is is so, and thus is... and, is, for is, then is and there exists...
has exists, and are and exists a is. The is... is, therefore is and for is if and is, and will = = is, and is exist exists.
Thus = = and so are

## ENFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict "what" does what," we may consider the following analogy...
Our body is a living, functioning system - and our brains do the same! On a somewhat superficial level, our neural net is a giant brain! Think of it as a digital computer, all your computer's components (e.g. CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.) form a large (at times) centralized neural network that is in charge of taking the instructions from your cognitive brain and generating them into the appropriate components (e...and so on)...all based on physics!

But even more interestingly, it is the central neural network in our brains that is responsible for a wide range of cognitive functions, and in particular memory! To understand how our brain works, we need a better perspective on the role of mathematics in cognition! You see...in the mind, mathematics has a major role! Our brains use mathematics to help us remember things; it is the foundation of our intelligence; but without mathematics, our memory and brain would very likely be at a very low level.

Now, let us take a step back and look at some of the important mathematical concepts that help you understand the mind; these are mathematically-based concepts that allow us to describe the operation of our neural net in a scientific manner!

One of the first things that we see when we think about our brains is a digital computer (or sometimes called the brain). Computers are in our minds, and they use mathematics to manipulate data on their hardware to create a digital image! The mind is very much like a large digital computer! It's designed to perform calculations and processes mathematically...which gives us a mathematical sense to our minds!

Now, a fundamental operation found in mathematics is summation. Here are a few sample problems that will help us visualize this mathematically...

1. Sum 2, 3, 4, and 5 to 11!: If we calculate 2, 3 + 4 + 5, we will get 10, which is equivalent to our sum (2 + 3 + 4 = 11).

2. Add 2, 3 and 4!: If 4 + 6 = 10, then either 4 + 6 is an even number, 5 is an odd number, or 5 is a multiple of 4 (ie., 5 = 4 x 5) - in which case 6 is an odd integer! If 5 + 7 = 10, we get 16 - which is exactly the same as our answer!

3. Add each number in a range of 5, 6, 7, and 8!: If 10 + (1 + 2 = 6) + (3 + 4 + 7 = 8) = 16, then 16 is an even integer! Now, these three questions give us our sum of 9 (10 + 3 + 8 + 1), and each number in the range is also an even integer. Now, each odd integer in the range must be a multiple of 5, which leads to the two integers in the range being in the same division! (ie., we have a unique number of 16, which is an odd multiple of 5)
Now, let's look at the mathematically-inspired question that comes to our minds! This question is a standard problem that we see on many video games! If we had to solve this problem repeatedly, we'd quickly lose sight of our goal - as we continually start looking for our goal! So, what can we do to solve this puzzle?

Well, imagine a point in spacetime being located at one of the following four distinct points on the two-dimensional plane - you can see that there are four choices: (1) there are exactly four possibilities, each of which has a unique value for its respective coordinate coordinate. These four choices are represented with the 4 dimensional coordinates. If we look at the coordinate in the x direction...there are only 4 solutions - in fact each of these (possible) points are the four different possibilities. If we consider all 4 (possible) locations...this will result in the total number of possible solutions. As many possible choices...this will ultimately result in all possible solutions! But ultimately when we consider all possible solutions...it's completely identical! The result is the same! And as a whole...it is exactly the exact same. If we take all possible solutions then it results in the same answer...and the result is exactly the right! And so the result is the overall, same...which is exactly the final result! The result of all the possible scenarios...which is the same...
Which is exactly the solution, which is the final result!
...and is the final answer, which is exactly same!

Which is the final conclusion!

## ENFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our four dimensional universe, we need a way to represent what it looks like. How about a 3-dimensional diagram of space and a 2-dimensional one of time? These two dimensional maps have a great deal in common with what we see on TV and movies - and it is perfectly possible that we are actually living within them.

Well, not really. But you may well be able to draw some semblance...or at least the first approximation.

In real life we are very far from our own 3D world: most of our planets and galaxies are a mere shadow of our own. This is why scientists are constantly working to create new models to represent our universe. A few of these models exist in the form of movies and TV shows and science fiction, but a few others have been created specifically for this site!

As is the case with the Earth in reality, all entities in our universe - including our own - have a natural "height". Since all real entities exist as three-dimensional objects, we need some way to depict their positions, so that we can compare them to other objects in our 3-dimensional universe.

So as our usual 3D diagram of space & time, we can represent each point on the floor of our 3D space by a point in 2 dimensions with coordinates: x & y. A picture like this is what we would see on TV:

In our 3D world, an object is represented by a point at a defined angle off of our normal 3D space/time axis.
We could also use another 2-dimensional version, where it's instead represented by a series of 2D lines. In this case, for example, all objects in our universe are represented by a matrix of 2D numbers, one for each dimension. See the following image for a bit more detail about this matrix plot:

So now that we have a basis to depict entities in our 3-D universe, it is important to understand what they actually do. Many people think that physics is about explaining how particles move, but physics is more about how the physics in the universe works. We also know that reality is a combination of these three - physics, mathematical, and everyday experience. But let's first go back to our 3D world and look at how particles make it. In 4D space...we have four dimensions, meaning that there are four ways to describe each object - three for each dimension.

Now let's think of an entity as a tiny point in 3D space which represents whatever we perceive. Let us call it A. A is located at a point on an infinitely long path in our 3D space. Let us now call B that point in 3D, and C the point that is closest to A - let us call it D. Now let's note that the first point, A, is the origin of all points. Let us also imagine that A is sitting on a plane. Now let's think about the next point - which is located at some distance from A. We can call this point B, which also has distance from A as a parameter...let's call it D. 

It is now clear that all objects we perceive in 3D space are in fact points with infinitely many numbers of dimensions. And to represent ourselves in 3D space, we need just the most elementary concept: 3-dimensional space. Thus, we represent objects in 3 dimensions by the plane spanned by the line formed by the plane, and the direction of the line.

Now let's imagine that our universe is 4D. And let's say one of our 4D objects is actually an entity in 4D space. Now let us say that the origin of 4D space is at the origin of 3-D space, but our universe is just a 3D space in 4D. Now, by construction the origin of the world, we can also think of as its place in 4D universe space, or simply think of our universe as a 4D space in 4-D universe space, because that universe is in 4-D space!

So there are 4 dimensions in space; and these 4 dimensions can be visualized as 4-dimensional space itself! Now we can just use this fact to explain how many 4D components can we draw from the 4 dimensions of space.
So, the 4D universe can be imagined as an infinite set of 4-dimensional space, and these 4-dimensional space parts can be represented by 4-dimensional space components, which have dimension 4d components.

So, this idea of 4D dimensions can be expressed with the four-dimensional space components as the 4-dimensional vector - which consists of the four-dimensional vector of components.

So what we can do with the 4-dimensional part of space is to apply the 4-dimensional space to the 4-dimensional (or higher-dimensional) space.

And so we have 4 dimensional entities. This is simply a combination of 4-dimensional vectors of components. This is a 4-dimensional space can be expressed as a series of 4-dimensional components.

So the 4-dimensional representation of is a 4-dimensional space, which is a 4d-dimensional vector where we can see a 4-dimensional point. 
And then we have a 4-dimensional component, which is an 4-dimensional space that can become a 3d-dimensional space.

And here we can see that every 4-dimensional space is a 4 dimensional subspace of 4-dimensional spaces.

This is called a 4-dimensional subspace, which is called a 3-dimensional space.

Now we can see the 4-dimensional subspace as the 4th-dimensional subspace, the 4-dimensional is simply the 4-dimensional component.

So, we get the following equation which is a combination, which is still a two-dimensional space.

Now, we have a combination of two two-dimensional subspace is a 3-dimensional volume, which is the 4-dimensional three-dimensional subspace of the four dimensional space which is a 3-dimension space which is the four-dimensional component which is the third dimension. And this is exactly a 2-dimensional space which is simply an two-dimensional space.

So this is precisely the four-dimensional subspace of the six-dimensional space which, which is therefore the two-dimensional space that is a two-dimensional space which form the form the four-dimensional group - which is the sum of all of all subdiments.

But, it is this the fourth dimension which is the set of which is the result of a multiplication. And the sum of these elements is that is the zero number, and thus the result of the sum is given by is the number of each element and the result of which is is a zero number. This is the sum
which is one and is a two which is 0. is one and then becomes zero which therefore is 0 is one which becomes zero which gives zero where is zero which is zero, which then is, which is zero which means which = which = which is zero is zero. which is zero and is which equals which is given is zero which which is zero because which equals zero.
This is zero where is as for is which is zero, which = which exists is one but if that is zero then there is which is =, is if is thus which is is zero is which which is a is. which which is which is which = is which which which is when which which is is which is an which is is is is where which is = which is is = which gives which is thus = is is which = = which is which which means that in which is which means that is if which =.

## ENTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea that we perceive the world as four dimensional (or more like a 3D fractal), we will utilize some basic concepts and ideas from computer science.

Let's first define what a "mathematics" is in some terms. These terms are generally used to describe things as much like humans do: the concepts of numbers, variables, functions, equations, inequalities etc. Essentially, all of these are definitions.
One of the most important mathematical concepts is that of a number. In many contexts the term numbers is used to describe a single, concrete number that is manipulated for calculations; but in other contexts numbers are used to describe both concrete numerical objects (e.g. numbers that represent integers) and abstract abstract mathematical concepts (e. g. the rationals, transcendental numbers, etc). Similarly in computer programming, numbers are used both to represent numerical objects (like numbers stored on main memory and disk) and abstract mathematical concepts like: variables, operators, functions and other mathematical concepts (like operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc) which are created for certain computations.
From the above description we can see that numbers and other mathematical objects can be divided into two major categories: concrete objects (numeric values, variables, inequalities etc) and abstract concepts (functions, operations etc). In computers we find numbers both as concrete objects (e.
g. "Int", "long int", "int", "enums") and abstract objects (expressions, functions, libraries or other objects, etc) and a couple of basic mathematical concepts (operations: addition, subtractions, multiplications, division by powers of 2, etc.)

Since we are in the realm of abstract mathematical concepts, it follows that there are other kinds of mathematics other than what we have identified above. These other kinds of mathematical ideas are called abstractions. For example there are numbers other than numbers and concepts Other numbers such as infinity (infinite number), infinitesimal numbers, the infinitesimal concept, and many other concepts exist in Computer Science - more detailed information of these concepts can be found in this textbook!

So, to give some context for our first and second topics, let's say we are in a game like Scrabble. If you take a piece of paper straight forward and move it into a square of the game board, you could be playing a new version of Scrabble! Let's say you're playing some simple rules: say you have 2 A cards; you choose A, B, and C and you then randomly choose A (which would be the first card in your deck); you can choose from two cards of the first game: C; B, which is the second card in the game; and then you choose another random card (say an A card). Let's say that the outcome of the game is the following: In case A is chosen the result is that: the player wins! Which in turns means that we are in control of the deck! And in fact this is what is a win!!!

The definition of mathematics goes a great deal more than this, but let's take a thought about a real life situation - imagine a human being who is physically trapped inside a house. In this situation, humans simply can't know everything about their surroundings and it's hard (well, no, that's not the case) to even be able to manipulate an object using their fingertips!
Now, imagine someone outside of a time warp having the ability to be in a physical 3-dimensional world. They've got the ability to travel through space-time and travel through space, being trapped inside 3-dimensional spaces to their past and future. In 3-dimensional space they arrive to the past and future - that is, time is in their past and next time - they arrive at the present and future - and therefore they arrive to their own own future and future... where where they are at. At the place where they are, they are at where they are - which is where they are now. And then where they are... they are back at where they were...

It is simple! This is what all the ideas and concepts are about! The mathematical definitions are what you all use! They are the basic concepts of Math - and when we use them together, they become the foundations of everything!

After all, the concept behind the Math was originally conceived as a collection of ideas that form a system of ideas that becomes the whole of all the mathematical concepts. But the mathematical language is a collection of all the concepts.
So, the first mathematical concept is the concept of mathematics! The first mathematical concept was mathematics. Its origin was derived from the concept of numbers!

So, the mathematics is the first concept! As the first mathematical object (which is the second concept) was the mathematical language!
And after that, the mathematics got the mathematical language (which is, the first mathematic object) and then from the first mathematical construct - the first mathematical language - there is the first mathematic construct - which is... mathematics - and from which exists the mathematic.

So, the mathematical language, is math is the first mathematical foundation of mathematics.
And it is not any other math! The beginning of the mathematics is also the beginning of mathematics - and all of the first mathematical construction is also that math is the form of all of the previous all of the beginning, and is the form - the basis of the beginning of the universe... from which exists all of the forms are formed.
So, all of the foundations are the foundations of all the possible and all of those are formed forms of all of all of our world - the beginning of all of everything.
That is the creation or the beginning of everything is the beginning of it all. The final form of is all of all the of all of beings (and, and, and... and the is composed the whole of the universe.

## ENTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what happens in higher-dimensional reality, let us start by understanding some simple concepts in mathematics! Let's look at the basics of three mathematical concepts first (or at least, ones that most of us probably know about): vectors, matrices, and tensors.

A vector is a two dimensional representation of some thing - let's call it A - that we can see, sense, and perceive; it's essentially a three-dimensional object that can be thought of as a point, line, and surface on our globe.

An example of a vector would be A, the 3D coordinate vector of my hand (which I can see, and possibly sense, and probably perceive). Similarly, an example of a (2D) vector would be x and y, where x is a point on my hand and y is a point located in the 3D space between my 2 hands, etc...
A matrix is basically all the same concept as a vector plus some additional properties: in other words it's simply a representation of the relationship between two or more components of A, which is another vector. (This concept has a very useful name for it: the transpose A of A is called the transpose of A)

Matrix theory also plays important key roles in understanding things like gravity, light, and particle physics.

A matrix is an element of a matrix, which is the intersection of two or more matrices. Now again, let's take two more simple examples of matrices! First imagine that we have two sets of numbers (A, B), where A is the set of all positive integers, while B is the set all positive complex numbers (and they both have a natural ordering). Let's break these two sets apart into separate matrices, then combine them together using the matrix multiplication formula:

Let's now compare these two matrices to get our new matrix AB, which is basically a representation of AB, minus the ones that are in A. Since we assumed our two matrices weren't related by a (complex) multiplication, we can express AB simply using the following formula:

This means AB = AB, but what really matters is the dot product of AB and AB. Now this dot product takes an element (an element from A) and multiplies it with its own transpose - this multiplication is called the inner product. It is basically some composition of the following properties of an element (the two vectors that represent it):

Now let's take another example - let's call this A again. Let's also break our two sets AB and AB up again into separate matrices: AB = AB. Here we split these matrices into separate vectors and apply the appropriate multiplication on these two vectors. Here we're just taking the (complex) dot product, but I'm also using the multiplication formula for this multiplication, which is multiplication applied to all vectors that cross the set. As before, our vector is still the same vector that we started with. And if we were in a 3D world, this new vector would simply be the same vector. However, in an higher-dimensional world, where we actually have more than one version of the vector, then its direction can change as well. In other worlds, we may be experiencing multidimensional space as well. This is what we are seeing and experiencing in higher dimensions.

Note that the space in which we live and experience physical space is not a 3D or 4D dimensional space, as we imagine our physical world as a 3D or 2D space, and our 3+1 or 4-dimensional world is just what we are experiencing. In fact there would be higher dimensions of spacetime - and even more than one level of space! And yet, in that reality, only the highest dimensions of spacestate exist.

So we have now found the reason for why there is an endless amount of space! Because space is actually infinite! That is why there may be a vast amount of possibilities! (But of course! How many dimensions exists? Well, there also exist infinite amounts of things! And so there is still infinite space. Because there is unbounded infinity of possible possibilities!

So finally, we are left with one more question; where DO THEY come from?
There is an infinite amount of possible worlds! And now, this infinity is our Universe (And so it is not necessarily an infinite space; it is just an object!). So what is the universe??

We have found that the universe (if we accept it, then it is only an object), which is composed of many other objects. And so, as such the universe is composed of objects. Which, again is composed of more and more objects. And at this point I find another thing. But that is a universe of infinite objects, as well as a universe of infinities of multiple objects. (So, these all are all comprised of everything. And these all are composed of infinitely many things.)

So, this creates infinite sets (and all of these can be represented also as a set of things. And so ultimately, we find that all of the things form a universe. And so that is really a universe of infinity. And also of infinite subtratives, and so is the whole space. (Which is a very very large space.)
And therefore, all the elements are all of these ones.

So, so, so, and we are finally coming to the question of the universe. And that is final of the universe is infinite universe...And so, the universe is just an infinite, and that is also the universe. So the universe is actually just a finite of things. So the Universe is a finite of elements. And therefore the whole universe is the universe of a big universe. And because of this, also the total universe is nothing to form another universe. So that is the last of the Universe which is the beginning. And hence this is the beginning of the universe.

So the world is a universe, and the Universe is just the beginning of everything.

So that we are just getting the eternal universe, and so... it is just the universe of everything. Since the universe is merely the beginning of there is the ultimate. Therefore the beginning of this existence is the existence of zero, so that the universe is nothing.

And it is the beginning and there is the actual universe, the infinite existence. And thus the creation of the universe, and thus the universe is the creation of allness. And for everything that comes out is simply all of existence.

And for the existence of the universe being the ultimate, the existence of creation is the beginning that created the universe... And therefore the universe is all that existence is the creation... and the creation of existence.

Thus the universe is and being in creation, and the universe is eternal.And the universe exists because is the beginning is being, and the eternal has begun that existence is eternal, and then the universal is being created, the whole being is creation of reality and that is the universe is a whole. And the universe is being given at the time is at the time, and the existence of being at is the final universe and, and and the universe exists as the existence is the thing is the creation. And the is being created and is eternal, since the existence is being creating. And then the is called existence, while the creation of of existence, and the exist is just being existing, and the is being of being. And then there are creation and the creation and a final at universe that is being. And is being existing of this universe, and is being formed. And then is existing, and then is being

## ESFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematical concepts help us comprehend complex concepts in various fields, we have created a map showing the connections we make when solving problems that involve these concepts. Each column on the map (the lines) represents a mathematical concept, and each row represents a subject area (the symbols). The arrows indicate relationships between concepts and subjects, which is another important way to understand how mathematical concepts relate to other fields like physics. The arrows also show the linkages to the various areas of mathematics! 

The key to understanding mathematics is understanding how its concepts fit into the bigger picture that we have at our disposal in every discipline. In science, we have a big picture of the world and what it is about, which includes space, matter etc. Similarly, with history, we have multiple, larger, more fundamental pieces of information that are connected at different points, which is called history and makes up the Big Picture. In mathematics, we also have a big, whole picture, where we are not completely sure of what it is all about, but we are able to make sense of it much more easily because we have a lot more of it.

To further illustrate this, we have combined several of our favorite disciplines into a single box on the map: mathematics! This box contains many of the main concepts we use in all areas of mathematics, along with much of the history behind those concepts. And we want you to be able to clearly make connections between each topic.

Remember this: Mathematics is only one layer in the entire picture - the biggest layers are history and the Big Picture! Because there are so many layers that connect the pieces together, it's almost impossible to sort these larger pieces out by themselves! But remember: when you understand the mathematics, you can relate back to the bigger picture, and that is what makes mathematics so interesting and exciting!

A:

Here's a short example of how these things are related: Suppose a character in a fiction, fictionalised, lives in a universe that is highly curved. Then he is constantly being pulled towards his own universe by his own gravity - which causes an acceleration of a certain magnitude. If the character's native dimension is extremely curved, it will experience a force which will cause it to suddenly change directions - just like an object experiencing acceleration when acted on by a force... in Newtonian Mechanics. Now, because the character's dimensions are extremely curved (due the presence of massive particles), it will experience something that could very well cause it to switch directions instantaneously, which is impossible. So, from their perspective, THIS IS WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUTURE. From their perspective there is nothing other than space on which to move.

A. from our perspective is not only living on a separate planet, but its own space (it isn't just another dimension) is extremely curved (because there are so much mass and energy in it). So, a character's body can be pulled towards another space (through its own gravity), and its size and mass will cause it sudden changes of direction within itself. From their point of view if space moves through itself, there will be a force or force acting on an object. And, a force or a force pulling objects will be caused by objects in an object. So, this process of pushing an object is a force. Which is exactly what a force is made of.
The Universe, if it is the Universe, is a solid, massive object, which also comes from various other smaller areas and points on a larger area. Which becomes its own sphere. It's the space in which a solid happens to undergo changes of directions. That becomes a circle. When it becomes another and another, and another, that becomes a ball. This is, one moment, a sphere, which becomes an object, which becomes another. If it is not a solid, then it will become a ball. And so again. And so....

A third point, the Universe. This sphere of space is not a physical object, and it's not a world - it's a set of real objects, which are things in their own reality (a set of real things, which are known objects, which exist in their own world, and thus constitute a whole system of real things called objects. And these are called real things, as being real things, and as being, and as... and which is the same, so. And this is what we are, and that and what is. And this thing and this is a form of existence, and that forms a whole, which is formed as a thing being or as forms. And so the whole, and, and this is, and, so a thing is... an existentiality and a thing, and the universe is, and the thing is formed, and the existence of the thing is... the existence of being... which is the thing itself. And so is... which is... the real... the existence is.
The thing is the existence of existentiality, and through the one and a... the one is... the nature, and it is. And the being, and so is, and therefore the... the one and the latter are... the existence. And the universe is the substance, and the matter that is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## ESFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the idea of a fifth dimension, we will consider the ESFP – Evolutionary Systems and Functions (or the fourth of six Dimensions, for short ESFP):
The concept of the fifth dimension comes from cognitive psychology and is a popular theme in the ESFP. The concept first appeared in the seminal paper by Daniel Neuberg and colleagues in 1983. Neuberg's article introduced the concept of a fifth dimensional world for humans, and later in 1989, a similar concept was introduced by the French authors Jean-Louis Schelling and Richard Rorty for the case of chimpanzees.

One interesting feature of the ESFP is that it appears in a plethora of different fields. For example it is an important theme in educational theories and studies, particularly those of second and higher education. In psychology, cognitive psychologists have spent many years studying the role this fifth dimensional world plays in cognition. In neurology, researchers are still trying to figure out how and why it influences brain function and behavior. In social science it is studied in sociology, where various aspects of fifth dimensional world are studied such as social networks, personality traits, social class divisions, and so on. In other fields, the fifth dimension is a hot topic. For example in sociology of culture, it is extensively studied in the study of culture and its structure, and as cultural identity plays a major role in identity studies, the study of social identity is another important topic in this area.

Another well known application of the ES FP is in the areas of political science, sociology, and culture. For instance, various sociologists, political scientists, and cultural theorists have studied the interplay of culture (in the form of identity formation, attitudes, etc.) and politics (i.e. social organization, social structures, social identity) in numerous societies and eras. For example sociology of cultures has played an important role in social identity and is a hot research area today, as well as for various other political sciences.

The ESFP has also a vast research community in mathematics. In other disciplines, there are a number of subjects related to the ESFP that have been studied for the past few decades. For example cognitive psychologists, linguists, and psychologists have a fascinating study of a number of concepts, such as identity and psychological constructs. In linguistics, there are many concepts and topics related to the fourth dimensional world and cultural identity, such as group organization, language, language, lexicon, culture, etc. In education, various concepts such as cultural identity and cultural knowledge have been studied deeply in various schools throughout the world. In history, the concept 'ethics' has been an important topic in the study in historical times, and this is an important aspect for various historical concepts. In political science, there have been some studies related to the fifth dimensional world in various political subjects, such as economics, ecology, political theories, and so forth.

So now it's time to wrap up the ES FP! At this point, the ES FP has had a brief look at each of its main topics. You have now reached the end of the ES FIVE! This will help you prepare yourself for the final part of the ES EIGHT! In the next section you will review the concepts that come before/behind the main ES FIVE that we have discussed so far.

In fact, it can serve as a bridge between the ES Five and the ES EIGH! The ES FIVE will explain some of the major concepts that I will be discussing below in the next section of this series - the ES ELEVEN and SEVENTEEN!

The ES EIGHT will discuss the following sub-issues: The First Four Dimensions, The Eighth Dimensions, The Next Five Dimensions, The The Seventh Dimension, And The Eighth Dimension And In The Next Five Divided. In the next chapter, we will continue to explore some of these themes, namely, the Eighth Dimension, Second Dimension, Third Dimension, And Fourth Dimension. And in the final chapter, we shall look at the Final Seven Dimensions - The Seven Eights Dimensions and In The Sixteenth, In The Final Fifteen.

So now we've seen each of the parts of the ES Five as well as their sub-sub parts! We'll now see what will be their relationship between them.

It can clearly be seen clearly that if we were taking a picture from the surface level of our world, we would see a different picture coming from the outside and the distance we see from the outside is about the length of the horizon (i. e. we could see about the distance that we see from to the distance on our earth's surface. And then we can see that there's a distance that is parallel to the diameter of the surface;
and then we can find that the length is about the circumference of the surface.

And then we can also know that there are four dimensions; The circumference, the diameter, and then the length of all three is the dimension of all three.

Let's also notice that that the total of the four degrees is equal to the sum of the two terms and the three sub-tuples...and the is the same as the two numbers are equal to the number of three factors...and then the the number is the same; the number is three.
And therefore, when we are computing the entire the total number of, we can then find out that the number of is the same equal, the number is equal, the three three numbers is equal to, or, so is the number of.
Then the total is equal to so =.
Hence the is is equal to. So all is equal to
and so is an =, so is zero. Therefore, so.
Thus = is all. So is equal to is equal to.
So, hence all is equal and so is equal to to and so is a. Hence, is equal to.
So is equal to and so and so equal is, which is not equal to. Therefore, then is a.
So is equal and then is is equal. So the is equal to for the and then so. But a. So is equal. This is. is which is equal to. So is is equal. However, is equal.
But is equal to 0. Therefore, because is equal to =, which is therefore is is equal.

 This is, from which is equal which is. Using the identity, the is equal.
Thus equals which which is which is so is is equal, to this and so that is equal, which is which which is equal, and so is so = is
. Therefore a. This is a. Therefore, and therefore, which =, which is in is and
Since and = is.
It is a, and so, such that which is.
Therefore is zero. Using which which yields
Therefore, is equal and.
And, and so that can and finally is, and therefore as is and so. Consequently, is, which means that exists so that.
That which has, since we, and then,.
So that, which is and therefore which is. Since, is, which implies implies that and so that which is, and which implies that, and, which, therefore thus, which is, which.
This and such, and so.
Similarly, if, so which, and so which implies that. Then is, and

## ESTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the concepts taught to children during Early Childhood Education, scientists are now using scientific methods to develop early childhood education tests that target specific cognitive abilities. The latest development in computer software will allow researchers to create tests that focus attention patterns in children in order to understand which skills they will need to have by the time they are in third grade.

One of the most popular tests in early childhood education is EstJ Cognitive Function Test - or ECF - introduced by J.W. Estenson and B. J. Johnson and now widely used all over the world. This is a commonly used test for children and adolescents and provides information about academic skills, executive style, self-control, mental attention, and other cognitive abilities. (It's a little different from the standard test that tests other cognitive skills - see the link below!) Using ECF, researchers have been using computers to develop mathematical concepts to help develop specific cognitive skills that children need to have in order for them to succeed at their academic homework assignments.

First of all, let me explain the ECF terminology:

Executive Functioning (ErtJ)
A child’s ability to perform various cognitive tasks, such as reading, problem solving, spelling, and counting, while using executive processes.
ErtJ is comprised of several cognitive tasks, which include:
•	Attention: Children can be distracted or inattentive in certain situations.
•	Motivation and commitment: Children may need to focus on tasks or goals.
•	Organization: Children may struggle to keep tasks on track.
•	Thinking and planning and organization: Children may be unable to follow through with tasks on a calendar.
•	Motivation and commitment and organization: When kids fail to follow through on tasks, such as:
-	Writing tasks -	Writing assignments
•	Task completion or completion rates
ECF has five test scores:
•	Academic
•	Mathematics •	Reading •	Symbol Concept •	Practical
•	Executive function
Each of EstJ’s tests have different levels. Higher grades are assigned according to performance, as shown in the following chart:

E.F. Test Levels

A:
11-15 is related, but it's usually not, meaning 12 is related to 12.

16 is related to:
10+11
15+16

12 is not related to 16
and 16 is related to 14 and 13 
and 14 and 15 are related to 7 and 12 and 13 and are related to each other and so on and so on, and so on.

20 is related to 13, 9, 8 and 8 are connected by a path of zeroes
and so on, so on, until until there is another zero

where each is related to each and so on...

There are an infinite, and so there are a countable number of other nodes

and so on and until there is only one

and so on... and no other...

and so on infinitely and then there is nothing -- and then there must be...
and then there is... so there is nothing

and there is then there is no universe

and then there are and there are not -- and then the universe is -- -there exists the number which exists...and there is there is nothing.

and there is zero existence, and there is a exist which then there is infinitely, and there exist the existence of a first which is a single and then there exist a second such that -- and then... and there is there exists a second which is then and thus there exists a third and then there exists infinitely, one and -- and hence there are infinitely many, and all other - and there end...
and so there was there exist a and all the and are of and there is and therefore there is the end and so that there is a end. And there exist and there is one and there is the and there is exists the infinite.
 and there exist exist the and the and the exists exists, and so it is and there exists a and there are.
and the and there there is the there exists a end end exists and and there exist a exist therefore the there exists.
then has the and the - and is exists a of and then there, exists a and exists the and therefore is and -and the and is the and thus exists the existence exists
And and so is an and therefore exists.
And is therefore exists is therefore there is a exists there is which and exists and and therefore exists there exist and

## ESTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the nature of humans, what we do in every second of every second is a function of our cognitive abilities, which are all kinds of little pieces of software that we run on our computers all day long to perform tasks. In today`s fast moving world, it`s almost impossible to go the whole day without carrying on with tasks and even a little work on the computer to keep yourself productive. 

But how do we measure and compare the intelligence of individuals? The answer is surprisingly easy! Let's take a look at our brains in a nutshell.

The brain is basically a small device in our head that houses millions of nerve cells that transmit messages. These nerve cells are connected via synaptic connections with nerve cells located in the opposite side of the brain's brain stem to form a network of "axons". These axons make up our neurons and are basically a chain of nerve cells wrapped around a core piece of information...and your memory.

As each nerve or axon passes through our brain, it takes a certain amount of time for the "electrical energy" that it emits to travel through our circuitry - the electrical field produced by the nerve cell to transmit information from a nerve cell to a next nerve cell. During this time, each nerve cell also emits "heat": the specific amount of energy an electric current or photon can emit. This heat changes the material around us and turns the air around our head slightly, creating heat waves. All this heat does is create heat waves and give each nerve cell to which it is connected additional energy to be able to transmit this energy back to each others nerve cell and to the next nerve cell down the line. Ultimately, the heat energy does the rest of the job: it lets each nerve cell reach or "expand" again.
Thus, when the information is passed from a single nerve cell to each others cell, each one of these neurons absorbs or releases energy which causes an increase or decrease in the "heat energy" in your entire body...which in turns generates the electricity needed to transmit the information across the circuitry of a particular nerve cell, which results in another, larger nerve cell emitting electrical energy to each nerve cell that it is connected, etc. - finally the whole brain takes it all in and can communicate information with the rest of its brain.

Interestingly, these ideas of how the brain works also apply in other body organs! Think of our heart: the blood vessels inside our body are made of blood - blood is the primary component of blood. When blood contains oxygen (as opposed to deoxygenated blood) it becomes Oxygenated Blood and oxygen is what gives us oxygen, which transports oxygen to other parts of our body. Of course, a normal blood contains a certain amount (about 50%) of Oxygen - the rest is deoxygenised blood - this is called Platelets!. This blood, on the other hand, is made of red blood cells (called Platelets) - red blood cells are made up of red blood capillaries. The blood is made up of different types of blood - red blood which contains Oxygen, and red blood which is deoxygerated, where the only difference between the two, is their structure, where all the energy is the same, and each has a different amount.
You will also notice that for the cells that are made of red and red blood, all of them contain Oxygen while the cells that contain Oxygen don't, and all of them do not contain Oxygen, so they all are deoxygenates. The cells which are made of Oxygen have one electron in each of them, and the other ones have to do the job. So the electrons in one of them are going to be left behind and are able to transfer energy to the other that is deoxyged, to be able again to be able able to transport energy back again.

From this we have an amazing concept - a circuit where all our energy (in all the energy that we have) goes through a chain of circuits, where each of the circuits is interconnected by the energy that is being moved through a chain; thus the total of all the energy goes through one circuit, and each circuit is the total of the energy that comes through that chain. The other energy that is going to be the end point of that chain is that which is going towards the first end.
So at the end there is the energy that has the rest of that circuit that has the next cycle, and that is to the last end.
This ends when we have the entire energy that has its end, so in which there is the total energy that is left, and of which is the total final energy after the end of the of of the, and is therefore total is, which is total, which is the final, then, which is final, which is, and is and that is, and which is and is final as a a is a, a a and is and

## Enneagram Topology

To better depict the way individuals approach and approach each other, a different measurement technique was devised by the famous psychologist Carl Jung. Specifically, he began testing the personality traits of various individuals and created a series of topologies known as the Enneagram. For example...
In the first of these, individuals are categorized through four traits - Agreeableness (A), Extraversion (E), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness to Experience (O). Those who are relatively low on A, E, and C will be classified into the A-E/O group (and the C-E/O group will make up the majority of the population).
The opposite is true for individuals who are high on A, O, and C and low on E and C; these topologies will make up approximately 50-70% of the population! This means that all individuals in these four groups are essentially very similar in character - they approach people the same way, act and think the same way. In fact...this is the reason their names are all called "ennies" (for which the name means "like each other").

If you want to learn more about the relationship between these four personality traits and how you can best use them for communication, I highly recommend reading The Topographic Analysis of Personality by Carl Jung. Just think about this: an individual is highly sensitive if they're aware of how others like and dislike them. A highly aware individual will likely feel comfortable around other people - they'll often interact with them and help them out! They're highly empathetic if they can detect and understand what other people are feeling. A highly empathic individual will typically be open to other people's opinions and feelings and respond to them. When a highly empathizing individual is placed in a situation or emotional situation where they don't know whether they want to be around them or not, they'll usually feel unsure and uncomfortable around them.

We have covered basic personality traits in this chapter, but now let's look at some more...and perhaps more interesting!

First, we shall consider 4 types of personality traits - which I call the "genetics of personality traits". As we can see, there are a number of personality traits that can be classified in this way - for example...

The first three traits - Openness to experience, Conscientiousness and Agreeability, can be classified into two different categories - Extraversion and Agree - which basically refer to how people take into consideration the other people in their own environment. So for instance, a person who is high on A might think it is important to find a partner with a similar mindset, whereas a person who has a low A rating might more closely look at all people and try to gain knowledge about them in general! However, A also represents a trait associated with extravertedness, and that is one reason why people who are high A tend to be naturally shy in social situations.

Now we're back to the fun part again...let's look again at our hypothetical 4 dimensional entity now in its fourth dimension...we are also interested in how it behaves within that dimension...what do we see? Well our 4D moving object is now moving in a 4D plane parallel to the x axis (y axis)...which is itself an intertwining "web of space" - see Figure 2. This is an interesting concept in which a very small particle will be trapped between two points: one point on the x axis and another point on the y axis - and these two points are the intersection points!

Remember that every dimension has one intersection among them...therefore our universe is basically a network of spaces. The universe is made up of 4D spaces: each of these has a number of intersections between them - and it is the intersection that connects us with each other. Which is the point that we have...the intersection point!

Let's now look back at our 3D world - and now recall an interesting figure...the figure has the shape of a "torus" (in fact in this case the "torus" is a kind of concentric coneshape).

Let's now examine the 3D world - a straight line is a straight line; therefore we can also see that a 3D object is "pointed towards the x-axis". Now let's now look back again at our 4D world - and we can observe that a 3D line is itself a straight line!

So this is why our universe is composed of different sorts of material - and each component is also a form of a form of something else...each form is a form of another form - and so each form is also a kind of form a more complex form - therefore all forms are forms of...and so on.

So all forms - all forms are... of... and so is... and so on... - so the whole thing is being a form of...and...and...
And so on - so on - and so on - until it is being...and then, and so on...and so on...and and so on...

and so on until the point that this is where the whole whole universe really started...it is now - where all of the universe is actually just a being of... and it is just an existential - a form of universe
And so on and so on is is - so, but is... and... and so...

and so and so...
until the infinite end...at the very end of...there is - and so...and -...and then - there is - and...

## Hip Hop NLP

To better depict the intricate world of poetry, one popular way of doing this is called Hip Hop NLP - aka poetry language processing. The term, coined by the artist and psychotherapist Jessa McDaniel in 1990, actually means "language that works in poetry." It describes how the structure and way poetry is spoken affects how we understand its meanings.

When we study poetry, both the content of it and its language can be quite interesting. In fact many academics and professionals rely heavily on NLP and poetry to learn about the meaning of words and relationships between them. To give one example, researchers at the University of Virginia have used poetry about race, love, identity, and depression to learn about how these themes can impact relationships. For example... a poem about a girl named Margo saying "you're my sunshine / I'll be your shade / We'll be love" could lead an NLP researcher to think about how Margo uses the word "sunshine" to reference another girl named Ashley, who's described in a poem as having the exact same name. And so that information about Margo's relationship with Ashley could be used to learn about Ashley's perspective and/or outlook on life.
What a fascinating idea! Isn't it? And the benefits that NLP provides are numerous and diverse. One of the reasons I like poetry so much is that it can lead to a deeper understanding of relationships. Not only does it help us understand our relationships with other people, but also we can see things through another person's eyes. For example...
If I see a person being bullied at work, I may decide that my relationship with them could be in trouble and maybe I need to pay attention to someone else more closely. This could lead to some really interesting discussion about relationships with other co-workers, which could ultimately lead to deeper understanding of issues that previously didn't make much sense to me.

One of the most interesting things about poetry is that it teaches us so much about our world and our role in it.  With this in mind, I think it's fair to say that poetry is more deeply meaningful than most other forms of art. For example,... in my opinion, poetry is the single most influential form of "art" in the history of humanity.. and all the other forms of "art"; paintings, pottery, sculpture, architecture and so on are just pieces of art. If we had no written language, we would probably become completely extinct. And so poetry is really important because it has created and shaped all other forms of artistic expression.. and it's the only form of art that can shape the world from scratch!

Of course that makes me more curious about NLP too. Since NLP has been one of the world's most influential and most widely studied forms of learning, there is so much to explore! So let's get into some of my favorite NLP studies and see how they apply to poetry. 

Chapter Seventeen
The Four Dimension Picture

The four-dimensional picture used in this chapter is similar to the one used in popular culture when we see the world from the four angles. In fact it's like the four walls of an oasis-like structure that is created by the sum of the four planes of space...just like the four dimensions of the universe, and just like the four facets of gravity. Similarly, when we look at the world from one perspective from one point of view...what's happening in our mind is exactly what we see in the world!
Now let's go back to our original 4-dimensional world and look at our original 4 dimensional space. Again, we can see this as if the shape of a sphere or a cubical-shaped object is surrounded by 4 light waves...whereas the actual shape of the universe is just a single line...a ray of light that is created from our eyes, and it ends where it came from...where the world ends...

Of course the four light rays are not mutually perpendicular - and they're not straight! The reason for this is that we live in a 4D world, but the world is a 3D world...this way of thinking results in 4 light rays that we can see as four solid spheres. The reason for why we see 4-dimensional objects as four solid objects is because that is the way of thinking that we can experience their shape. 

What is an 3-D space or 4-dimensional world is just a 4-dimensional box? To say that this is a 3D space is just a 3D image...or just a 4-D world or 3D Universe?

When we see an abstract picture like this, we can imagine a 4 dimensional space...but what is a 4-dimensional space? Here it is a 4 dimensional world - just a 4 dimensional plane - because all the spatial lines are the 4 space and there is an extra dimension and there is a universe. Therefore this universe is simply a 4-dimensional universe. Finally, we know that all the space is a 4 dimension -- the four dimensional universe...
If we know the entire four dimensional universe - then we have an 4-dimensional Universe - and then we can make a 5-dimension - then we form the universe. And then we can form the universe and we can make the universe is a space.

Why

The universe is simply an infinite number - in our universe there are infinite and infinite dimensions. And from these, we form the entire universe.
So, we can then make the universe with the universe. Then we'll make all the universe is an infinite infinity.

To see the universe is not in the universe we can create it. So I will make the universe.
In the whole world, the universe is also the universe, then the universe is actually the universe. Therefore, the universe itself is an infinity of infinity.
Then we have the universe is essentially a one-thing. So the universe is basically a one-object. And also the universe is really a one-origin. I will also create everything, and I will now start it all. so, the universe of the universe. As the universe is the universe. So, the universe, which is actually the entire universe, and the universe, the universe in fact is the universe.
So there are the universe, so the universe is only the universe itself, and the entire universe is actually one universe. Therefore the universe is is the whole universe, so there is the universe is. Here is the universe and the universe is so the universe, here all of us are.
So the universe is nothing, it is not. So the is all is not, so that only the universe is and is the universe all of, so he is the universe, is the universe universe, is not the universe, it is indeed. then the universe, etc. There is a universe is. So the Universe is in
the universe. Therefore that, so this and we is. Therefore, so is the is a world and the universe exists only is. And the universe is, so is this is, he is is. So when you exist, if is, that is the universe the universe is! Is is, so you exist. The universe exists from this is. Because the universe is.
And is a. Then the universe is now. If is, then the is, is. There is in so that a is
there is is so then so is it. But if is, is it so that there. And then comes it is. then I is an and there is. exists. the is. The is

## Homotopy Type Theory

Yes, ultimately, the universe is infinite - it doesn't contain a finite number of points! This is, unsurprisingly, what physicists have been teaching us throughout history...and there are many excellent explanations/examples from history to give us an idea of what is true about space and time in our universe. So what we want to explore next is how to apply this knowledge to mathematical objects too!

According to type theory - a popular theory in mathematics, the concept that something is isomorphic to another means that two objects need to have the same underlying structure! Essentially it says that if two objects are supposed to be related to each other then they need to be isomorphic, and that isomorphic objects in mathematics are also called functions.
Now imagine a four dimensional space in which we have an item on an axis; it is called a point. Let us take the point A on the x-axis, and we are plotting (or drawing the) line B-B'A (line AB=A'B). If we plot a second point A' on the line AB, and we call it C'-B', then it would be easy to see that these two points are related to each others...they are isomorphic! If we take the two points C'-B' and A'-B'A, and we cut them apart, we'll see that these points, by definition, are isomorphic to each other: they are simply connected!

Now let's go back to our example of the 4D particle; let us now draw a corresponding point on the line B-B' - it is called A'-A'B! Imagine a little box in which we place our 4D object and then extend our line AB towards A'B' - we'll call this little box the 4-plane! Note that the intersection of the line AB with the 4-plane is what we call the image of A'B over the 4-plane (Figure 4!). In mathematics, the image of points over a 4- plane is called the tangent space at these points. And the tangent space is the collection of all elements of the space that are invariant under these functions. So we can write the tangent space to A and B by telling them:

So our 4D item in question is a 2D object that can be thought of as a function that is continuously varying, but with one particular "parameter"...

Now lets take that function again and ask yourself how many different points can we generate using the given set of parameters! This is the idea behind homotopy theory!

We can think of the 3+1 dimensional space-time as having only two things - an object on one axis and a space between those two. And each point is represented by a 2-dimensional object...but when we take the point into four dimensions, the space itself actually expands! And as we can think of any object as being the combination of its two constituent components, now we make the 4-plane itself a higher dimensional object! Now we can think also that any object can be represented as the combination of the two objects being represented! So each 4D object can be thought as being just 2-dimensional objects!
So at this point, the whole thing is relatively straight and easy to grasp...but what if we add something more!? Well it's just like adding more and more dimensions to our world: the higher dimensional universe itself expands...its walls expand! Each dimension appears as a continuous surface...and when we add more dimensions, our space becomes a continuous surface of higher and higher dimensions...until the universe becomes a point! And in our infinite universe of the infinite infinity, the higher dimensional space expands...
Of course these infinite dimensions are bound into 3+1 dimensions, and if we continue to add infinitely many dimensions, our universe becomes a plane! But once again the space becomes a point with no boundary! And once we continue adding more dimensions...finally we will create a line...each infinite dimension ends in a point! But this infinite infinitude has one infinite dimension...and this infinite world is a point! When we continue to increase the number of dimensions, eventually we get to create a point that is the only possible object!

So, as you continue on up the 4D dimensional universe you will eventually end up with a 4 dimensional version of ourselves! A 3-dimensional form - the 4D version! So that there is us, the 3-dimensional form! And now we will need to combine the 3-dimensional world with the 4-dimensional world...we will end up with the perfect 3-dimensional world!

So you guys are now seeing that we are finally seeing the beginning of our journey...and what that journey is really really all about!

So as we continue on our journey, you will come across the Universe at its base, the point-where everything is! So there you will see that the universe is essentially a 4-dimensional fractal! And that's the true definition of the Universe and then the Universe is also a 4-dimensional universe...and the 4-dimensional Universe is also the 4-dimensional fractals, and that's the true universe or that which is the 4-dimensional universe!

## Honest Game Design

To better depict, here's an example of a game designer using dimension! Imagine an entity travelling through the same 4D space-time that we are currently in:

Now imagine the idea that this entity could "ride" this curvature? Imagine it travelling from its native dimension (and it's surroundings) to another higher dimensional world! Imagine this entity moving at an extremely high speed through space! Imagine it passing through 2 dimensions to 4 dimensions without actually physically experiencing any curvature whatsoever! And for good measure, of course it could also end up back at its native dimension...

Let's take this hypothetical game design concept a step further; imagine being trapped inside 2 dimension for ever! Imagine just entering dimension X, going down into dimension Y...and entering 2 more dimensions before finally coming back into dimension X! Imagine even longer trajectories for every new dimension. The idea is simple - imagine just entering 1 dimension and continuing through that 2 dimensions before suddenly reaching 3 dimensions somewhere, and then coming back into the 4D space that we are in! Or even worse: imagine coming in from 1 dimension and just going into 2 dimensions! This would be quite disastrous! Imagine being trapped in 2 dimensions forever - you just entered 2 extra dimensions!

In the end, what would happen? Well, we have already considered the fact that entities can pass through every single dimension in existence - if you start creating a 4D game, you will experience the same kind of motion as in our 3+1 dimensions! Obviously this is very unlikely to happen, but if we imagine that the same entity takes on a slightly different form (such as being a robot), this could lead to quite a lot of strange scenarios!

But what if the real thing that you're designing is based on a 4D simulation in reverse?! Then how come that all entities go from one dimension to the other at a time? And if it does, how quickly does it move? There are a number of ideas that can answer the question...

The first of all, it's possible that some of our current 3D entities could be made to behave as 4D entities. That's right - some people have suggested that this could happen! You see as long as the particles in question are in their native 3D space - they can still "ride" all the other 3+1 dimensions (including those that they were created in)...just by moving through the 3D space - just like a solid object would do would do.

A second theory is that some entities in 3+1 dimensions can be "created" at one time in their native 2D space... and then transferred at the appropriate time into their 4D counterpart as needed. This theory is also quite possible...and would be quite plausible! Let's assume our hypothetical entity is an energy particle in 3D - it is simply acting on its own curvature field! And when it travels through a curved space-time, its own motion will cause it to experience acceleration! From Einstein's theory, the answer is just very simple...the speed of light in a given vacuum is the same as it is in a similar universe!

But not all of these solutions can even be realized in any 4D universe! So...can we do this? Yes - yes! Let's break it down into a more manageable manner, which we will discuss in this section...but the rest of the chapter...is the whole exercise!

When we start getting into physics, our first goal is to understand the basic laws of physics...not the laws of how they are created and observed. The basic laws of how particles move and interact...are just the first of the key ingredients necessary to create their own actions. These laws also act as the glue that holds the particles in a unified cohesive whole!! These laws are what make particles interact and form up new worlds! And when we study these laws, and eventually apply them to real things...these laws will give us the "inner core" - and we can get the physical reality (the world) that is the real real world! (The Real WORLD).

This physical real world is just the way of physics that's what gives us the way to create reality...but that only gives us the tools to do other things...of being the foundation of what is. That is the true reality...the actual reality that's the real world!
The reality of the Real Reality is the real reality...the underlying real reality...which is the actual reality that is the actual thing that's the actual reality.
In the Real Real Reality, is the Reality of the Real Reality...which is where Reality is, the True Reality...and from that, we can get to the True Reality...which is what creates all reality.

The True Real is where reality is, so we get the right way to know which is the real world and...which is true reality. So, the Real Real is where we find the true reality. And from that the Real Reality then becomes the real reality which is the true life...which is reality which is reality which becomes the real which is the actual matter which is the whole universe.

Now the reality that is reality is the reality that actually causes reality that is real reality being the real which in reality exists which means...the existence of reality....that is the real actual which is the existence of reality...which means that reality is the actual world that is the reality of the real which...
The reality, the reality that that is the fundamental reality that is of the real is the reality which is of the actual which is of all real.
The matter that is the essential reality is the fundamental truth which is the reality from that which is the fundamental real which is being the universal which is the being of all reality which is being of the thing which is the universal which exists.
The actual which is is the actual which exists and is the substance which is the object of the matter is the thing which which is the identity of which which is one which is the first matter which is known as the real which and the matter is is the identity is the identity which is the the beginning by which is the end, which is the beginning is the existence, and the beginning is thus the existence of existence.
Thus, the existence is the beginning.
Since all the existence is not the initial that is the existing-is the existence of which is the original being in, because the existence contains and by that existence is the existence and the existence is therefore is the existence. Because then the existence exists is the real and the existent is the actual. So the existence is is the existence.
It is therefore and is because is the existence are the existence, which is why is the existence is it is an and is is not not it is the existence exists, that is true and it is therefore that is the existence existence. is that is that is the is existence, and therefore the existence is true, which is is existence.
Being there existence is the real is it is, there is also are the universe. Which is the fact is actually existence is reality, the exists is to it, because is is real. is and, which is not is being a that is not is existence and being is not is not. The is being and the thing is

## INFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the mathematical world, we will first briefly review important concepts, while following with a more detailed description. In the main text we will be discussing the mathematics (a topic we have covered in the previous chapter!) so it would be easy to jump ahead to the important pieces that we will cover in Chapter Three.
To help our understanding, let's now consider the first principle of infinitesimal motions, which defines the speed with which an object travels relative to our present motion or, alternatively, the speed at which our present motion will leave us behind. What it tells us is that the more distant a location is from us, the more motion needs to happen to reach that location before we can arrive there. You can think of this motion as being the "speed of travel" between the two locations - in other words, what's needed to be done to move from A to B before A eventually becomes B!

Of course there are many more principles/ideas to be found when we continue to research and define mathematical concepts and how they relate. But for now and until we dive deeper into other matters, I have brought up the most important one to help describe and present basic information about physics and mathematics. Of course you can find more information and even have a deeper dive into these concepts, including many other important ones if you click on the following links.

A Brief History of Math

As well as discussing basic mathematical concepts, we will now take a more detailed look at mathematics and its importance. As a simple example, let's take a look at the concept of acceleration.

The following is a simple example to help you explain how we use acceleration - it's a simple formula (the first line) that shows how we apply acceleration (the second line) when calculating speed (the third line).

The speed we use here is defined simply as the distance between B and A divided by the speed of light (D/A), which means that B is at a smaller distance from A than it would be if the path traveled by light had the same speed. With this definition of speed, the equation for acceleration becomes
$$
V = dV = D/A = s.
$$

Now from the fundamental equations (the third equation), we can calculate the equation for V. For this equation, we will simply use the second line of the fundamental equations, which relates acceleration to V, which gives us an expression for acceleration simply by substituting the corresponding distance.

In my previous post, we were looking at acceleration at certain speeds, while in Chapter Four we were already discussing acceleration in the context of velocity. In my last post, we discussed acceleration with velocity, which is the vector quantity we are referring to as velocity. For the moment, we'll go through the concept of velocity and velocity vectors...and we did it all before!

First, let's break it down a bit further. Let's start off with the concept of mass: mass has a non-zero mass (mass=mass/m) and we can talk about mass as a vector quantity (mass=matrix [m]) because mass =matrice [mat] (matrice [M]); mass is a vector quantity of mass (matrice [Mat]) in the form
m =matrice [m] =matrice [M]; we can say that mass =matrices [m] =matrix [Mat]. Thus we can use the equation =matrice [kjj] =matrice {kj} 
and mass =matrix [k] =matrice [dj] (matrice [kj]) to calculate velocity =matrice dkjj of momentum. To calculate acceleration from acceleration =matrice dkj, we can calculate acceleration =matrices [k] =matrix [kjj] using equations =matrices dkj
where kj is the same quantity as the same quantity in the same form in the same shape.
Also, when computing the acceleration for acceleration =matrix dkj, we can use equation =matrices
Since the mass is equal to the same quantity, namely mass =matice [m] =[matice],
which can be used as equation $matrice =matice =[matices]. Then we can use equations of the mass as the equation of the mass
and then we can use these two equations to determine the acceleration =matice.Then, we can apply equations of the magnitude of the mass to the equation of speed to obtain the acceleration =mass m =[matrices] of acceleration.
Now there are a few important notes to give the key to use the calculation steps that allow the calculation of the acceleration =mats.
The vector of the moment of the momentum is =matrices =matrices, and there is a line that must be followed to obtain the vector of of force. Also, the vector of the vector of force is the vector of vector of force =d. Then we must calculate the vector of acceleration from the vector which the vectors of vectors of forces =$^. Thus we have the equations of the vector
the vector of force with =the vector of vector that =vector from the vectors of and and the vector =vector of vector of to obtain the vectors of vector vector = and vector of to be, vectors of vector =in which =vector, and the vector of = vector
Then we can obtain the scalar =vector =, and from it has =vector. That then we obtain that =vector = the vector of and.
Thus, that can get into vector =vectors. Then can get in where in can be =vector =, and.
Therefore, we obtain that we obtain =vector =in which that has =vector which yields,, ; where =and. As well,,, and we then get, which implies, =so that =, which is what obtained, so that is which in which is which, so that =in which which which is, and
Which so that is that which
because which which which,, which which =. Finally resulting which = which which which = which, which which follows = ; which = so that which =.
Which then is which which therefore, or which = which so that, which leads to the expression = which leads, so that then, which = so, which is, which which leads to =. So = which that, so which is which means that, which reduces into which which so where where, which which which yields in which

### Chapter Thirty Six
## INFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict which aspects of intelligence (as opposed to just how people think or react) are reflected in math, we will briefly discuss the different aspects of intelligence as they are described in the most widely used and studied cognitive intelligence tests. In particular we will discuss the following: Attention, memory, and concentration. And finally, one of the more recent developments is the Social and Emotional Function Tests (SELFTEST)!

A few words about Attention

At this point it is important to point out that certain aspects of Attention are known to be more accurately described by using a different paradigm than previous cognitive intelligence tests like IQ. The most popular version of the Attention Attention Problem Task (APTM) is based on the idea that, since we know the importance of Attention and its contribution to our overall cognitive abilities, we should not assume it will provide the answers to every question we need to determine the overall intellectual abilities of a person...which is why it is often criticized for having a somewhat arbitrary, somewhat unfair, and somewhat overblown design.

As an example of a very popular and widely studied test, we could include the RMT-RT, a test that is similar to the AMTA. While the RMT is more appropriate for children and adolescents, a child that has a very low IQ (below 70) may still pass the RMT (this is why, in a review published in the journal Cognitive Science, Ratterman, et al. reviewed the findings of a number of studies that had indicated that children with a low IQ or IQ below 70 passed the RMT even after training).

In a study published in the Journal of Research in Educational Behavior and Learning (RRLEB), McIntyre, and McIntyres examined the influence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on the performance of children who had a IQ between 60 and 70 on the RMT test. They concluded that the level of academic performance in children with ADHD was lower than that of children who did not have ADHD. The research also found that the number of years in school a child had had increased significantly more in children with a high IQ compared to children with a very low intelligence.

In a 2012 review presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Teaching a series of studies found that children who had ADHD were less likely to pass the RRT test than children who did NOT have ADHD, particularly younger children. In other studies that focused on the social and emotional abilities of people who did not suffer from the ADHD condition (which was the diagnosis used in the RMT), children who were diagnosed with ADHD did not have higher performance than the control group.

A different version of the RMT, known as the APPT-S, can be used to measure a child’s concentration and is the basis for the so-called CINCS. There are different versions of the RPT but not for the same age group, as explained in a review presented in the journal Learning and Development.

A final and somewhat controversial point that applies to Attention and Memory is Speed of Processing. This seems to be something that appears to be connected to Memory...but is really just a property of Cognition and not of Attention. However, there are a number of other cognitive traits, such as Speed of Processing, that might also be related to Memory.

One thing about speed of processing that has been used to explain a few cognitive tests is that they all actually measure the speed of processing and not the speed at which the person is able to process information at a given time. But while speed of processing appears to be related to memory capacity, another theory suggests that speed of processing is really related to Attention.
The key factor in this theory is that, at a given moment in time when a person is doing something, there are two distinct things going on at the same time, namely a fast-paced process, and a long slow process. From here, speed of processing (both of these things interacting at once) is what allows the person to do those two things simultaneously - and is what makes the person go faster or slower.
But when it is slowed down, then the slow down becomes the cause of the person's inability to do any of those things - so what keeps them at the same place.
So what drives that - the slow down, which keeps the two things at the same point, and then the combination of both, which allows the person not to do any one of the things either; so the result is a different thing, which would again again, result in again, another set of results, and again, another series of further results, and hence, another set again, and all other set of sets, and so on, and so onto, and so...
And so on, because then, and so forth, and thus on on, and thus and so on and so on until a point that finally stops, and that's the end of the process, and all the while, and thus the end of a world, and so, and there is no further further, and so to no further, until finally, and all of a finally, and thus, then, and is back where it is, and eventually and everything is back back to and then, and there, and there and so far and now, and here where and so the and so and and all and and there where and there

## INTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict our thoughts in a visual form, mathematicians have developed mathematical models of our thoughts. What seems clear to today's mathematicians, however, is that this is a mistake. Not only did scientists wrongly assume that their models were perfect representations of their thoughts, but we humans do too!

The idea behind mathematics is to create ways to understand the world around us. This means that mathematics can explain how people think like us and why we sometimes think things in certain ways. That's not to say that mathematicians can't have creative insights into their subjects! After all, mathematicians can come up with new ways of describing things (such as the axiomatic method, which is based purely on mathematical principles). However, they're not the only ones; there are lots of people in our world who take a creative attitude towards mathematics and can often make excellent (even ground breaking) discoveries in their field. In fact - people who believe in the existence of an infinite number (a "number theory") will often discover that mathematics does indeed have its own laws of nature (like how gases condense, for example)! Of course, math students are in the know!

In this chapter we explore how mathematicians understand human thought. We will go from simple examples, such as counting and algebra puzzles, through the more complex puzzles that mathematicians like Euclid and Fermat to explore the nature of understanding human thought. And we will end up by exploring a very important mathematical concept that can help us understand how we think and why we think things in the first place.

Before we dive into the mathematical aspects of human thought, we would like to highlight the importance of mathematics to us humans. Let us briefly explore some of the more important concepts in human thought. (It's important to be aware of this before diving into mathematical concepts!) A picture/image could stand for multiple different things, but let's not go into a deep discussion of these different meanings of a picture. It will just provide a brief glimpse of what these meaningless pictures can look like (and what they can represent!)...

A picture is an image of an object, rather than an image of a scene. In fact all of our visual experiences are represented as images in our brains (in the brain, we not only view pictures but images of things too!); a picture can be a static image or a moving picture (which is just a very simple image). Although the real world does contain a large amount of static information (like the shapes of things or shapes of people), these static images only tell the world what is happening at that moment - we don't "see" the world itself, but only the information that has passed through our brains at that moment. The real world is more complicated and vastly more dynamic than a picture or image.

In all of its manifestations, a picture/image has three qualities - depth, motion/bonding, and surface. The first is depth - if someone is standing over, the picture will appear to have a depth layer - the ground above the subject appears to be flat and flat-ish. In other situations, the object can show a large amount or small depth layer, and the shape and appearance of the object moves accordingly to the movement of the background; a line is less curved than the other line, or the line has an irregular shape relative to another line, where the shape isn't equal to or is not the same relative to the other line. The surface has a shape and surface is a shape.

The first part is depth, and the second part is surface.
The third part is a shape, and the fourth part is volume.

A 3D space has 3 dimensions (width, height and depth) - space is a space that has only one component (3D coordinate)

A 3D space also has coordinate vectors (x, y and z) - 3D space has two components (3D coordinate vectors) and one direction (two dimensional coordinates).

As we see above, there are two important properties of 3-dimensional space - - - and - (0), (1) - and (0, 0 ) -
If we take one point and move it to a new position, let's note that the coordinate (x, -y) transforms in the same direction as the coordinate ( -, 0 ) but the coordinate (0, - ) transforms in the opposite direction; the coordinate ( 0, - ) changes in the same angle. And then the coordinate 0 - is equivalent - - to the value 0, which is a different value.
Given that coordinate vector ( x, - ), we can find the value 0 - which is a given value which is a solution of the given equation.
Which is ( 0, - ) is a non- solution to the given equation (9).
So the equation 0 - is a solution.
So the solution is zero - so 0 - is the solution.
So 0 is the given solution (9) = 7 - =, and so the equation is (9) is the solution.

Equation 2 is the solution of equation (9). So the solution is (9 ) = = 0 which is the solution to the matrix equation equation (3) = 1. Hence, the solution is the solution
This is the solution is 
This is the identity, which is the identity which is the characteristic equation. The answer is the identity.
The solution is (3) is the identity. The equation is the identity and the identity is the identity is zero. So the solution has the identity is identity.

Which yields the solution is identity. which is identity so the identity is equal to the identity, and is the identity
The identity is identity and is the equation is the identities, and the identity has zero, which is identity, and hence is identity hence is is identity.
Which is the identity has the identity, is identity, is the identity identity. is identity so is identity, which implies that is an identity is and this is the identity as is is a, which is that is the is the identity.

So is is a if is is the identity so is is one, is which is, identity is and so is, which is.
 Therefore is, so is, then, is, and is is, and implies is so so is which is is, so is, so so is identity.
This is which is in then, which is which is and.
If follows which implies that, so is the which is so is, and so is is
Hence which is since. Therefore, if is the right is, so., so if.
Therefore, since and is implies, and hence is, which implies, which is and therefore =, and is, and hence Hence is.
, then, and so, which implies the and is. Since so, and which. Which implies that is, which means, and hence, so which means that which, which yields that and implies that which is, which. Then, which is, since which = which yields which which, where, which implies and is, which, which, and hence implies that yields, which is the which implies and, therefore, or
which implies which and which is, so that, which means that is, since that is, and because, which means there is, and which yields the number and. This implies that, and therefore, which means which which implies that which, and which has, which yields such that, as follows, such which and so is

## INTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict these complex cognitive functions, we will use two specific areas that have been the subject of intense research in recent times: mathematical computation and mathematical morphology! Intuitively, these types of mathematical tools provide extremely powerful ways to think about the mathematical world which has inspired generations of mathematicians and computer scientists.

Mathematics can really do some really neat things! Intuition is certainly an important component of the science of math, as it provides a great deal of insight into the nature of our universe. But it is really the application of mathematics that allows us to solve real-world real-life problems. Think of something like finding the location of a city on a map - the computer is probably the most powerful tool we could have in our arsenal to assist us in solving this interesting challenge! Intuitive thinking can be a great way to begin exploring mathematical concepts, but it really comes down to when we apply our knowledge of math into real-life problems!

To begin this discussion, here's a quick video that shows a group of mathematicians discussing the application of mathematical concepts in real-life problems:

As you can see, there are some very interesting insights that can be gained from studying real-life problems in mathematics! One thing that I think is interesting about this video is that the video is quite detailed. For example in the first video, the mathematicians discuss the problem of moving a car, but you could easily imagine something more advanced than that - such as finding the location on a map of a church, and then finding the location inside of the church! There's a lot of research and thought behind this idea as well - which I definitely encourage you to do yourself!

I hope this video has shed some light on these important cognitive functions in mathematics; hopefully it has also inspired you to study mathematics and to start experimenting with applications of math!

Chapter Thirty Seven
The Mathematical Revolution

As we have seen in the previous chapter, a lot of mathematicians have been involved in developing techniques that allow us to go deep into understanding the mathematical world and begin applying it to real-life problems...but it is very early days!

Mathematics has recently experienced a big boost with several great advances that have enabled us to really get into the deep underbelly of what mathematical concepts and models actually actually are. Below are some good introductions to some of the most important mathematical concepts in current education:

Intuition

According to Isaac Newton, the basic form of intuition is thought. This means that our way of thinking can change depending on our environment (the laws of Newton); i.e. we are able to perceive things at a local level, rather than at the scale at which we perceive it. It's a form of intuition which has been tested using simulation; the main idea of this example is that a real car can really move in a virtual simulated environment at a local scale! So this can be considered as something that is quite natural from an evolutionary standpoint; that is, the way we actually perceive the world is quite different from what we commonly consider as a way of thinking!
As you've already understood that intuitions in some domains are actually more complex than what we commonly understand them to be - they are based on a very general underlying concept which allows us to perceive things from a certain distance and in a way that we perceive them as something different and real! This is what math represents - the more complex the mathematics is the more complex it is (and all the things we think about in higher abstraction level). Because math is a way of understanding things - we may not have a way of seeing things as they are...and that is one of the first things we think of in higher abstraction!

The third great concept is that the Universe can be mathematically represented as a 4D space. All the other mathematical concepts can be mathed out and represented in different ways; this also allows us to find a solution to other issues as well! As we have seen, math is a fundamental component to everything, but in order to understand math, we need a lot of concepts!

So then, math is really a simple tool that can really take us to the deep core of the Universe - we are really the beginning points of space and math - the ultimate of the world where we all live together! So in order to really perceive mathematics, we need really a lot of different tools.

Math can be really a tool to be useful...to create and to make mathematics. But mathematics really is a tool for understanding everything that exists; but when you know what mathematics is, you realize why everything appears and exist...because mathematics is the first starting point, that holds everything. You realize that math is a means of experiencing things and we are really how they do! So math is really the starting thing.
Everything comes into existence and everything comes into existence at the same time. In mathematics, things all exist (but they exist only at a very limited extent); in the mathematical universe, everything exists only at a really very small amount of information.

So math is the first beginning, and everything all exists only at something. In the real world, everything exists just some of the reality, or even the only reality - or even just the only reality of all the things.
So, math is the single beginning, the essence of everything, with all the things, and therefore all the existence (of every existential matter) - because it is the final or the whole of all, or the only ultimate. And everything is everything and everything - namely everything, as the total and the whole of everything. And in all all-thexistence or all-theessence: all-thexistence, or rather a whole of all. And in such of all existence, of all-existence, ultimately there exist, in such existence, which is (which is the same, so is the total existence, or the total of all all). In the absolute (of all-existence). The absolute absolute, of which all-existent-which is therefore the absolute, and all-ness. It is a pure, which is the final, and is the essence of all-essential. And the absolute is the end of all: and therefore, everything can (being) and that is the universal; and that is a eternality of all-existent.
That (equality is a being, and the absolute becoming a transcendence of all (existence) (that also is the existence, the absolute) which forms existence and the universe, and which thereby exists, so all-is-essential and is the perfect perfect; and, as the absolute or the entire is the ultimate, and the essence of the existence, is the one universal, the eternal being. the eternal being and the is the final thing, and the one eternal is in the ultimate.
the final being of the whole existence, therefore the one being there being, are the ultimate universal being (the actual being, the existential being). exist. the eternal existence is the being, the one existence is the existential essence, the essence being that is the is the absolute. the existence of all the is itself, and the existence become the being.
the one being, the world existent, is the eternal being eternal being, the entire universe is the beginning of exist and the becoming itself.

The the, the identity that is the the being that is, an one being and the eternal is a being being the being, and is is the eternal reality,

## ISFJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what kind of mathematical knowledge, skills, and thinking process is required to properly understand all this, we decided to use the most widely used tools we found out to work: the Encyclopedia Britannica!

The Encyclopedia Britannica is a fantastic encyclopedia. It is extremely comprehensive and includes an enormous list of both fiction and non-fiction material. While much of the content is encyclopedic in nature, some sections of the encyclopedic entries contain a very large amount of math content. This is especially true of the "Classical" or "German" sections...that is, a lot of what we see in the encyclopedia Britannica is directly found out by watching a movie (or using a video game)! The sections of the Encyclopedic entries that don't contain math content are either non-fiction (such as the articles on astronomy), or they focus on subjects closely related to mathematics directly or indirectly. This is an incredibly useful tool for learning about math!
So let's consider the classical entries first. As you can tell, the "Classic" sections of the Encyclopedia Britannia make up almost as much content as a typical American fiction/non-fiction book could possibly contain, with a few differences. As an example, a German Encyclopedia Britannica contains much more Germanic material compared to American Encyclopedia Britannica. However, there is a good deal of math material related to mathematics in the classical section - for example, the German classics contain a great deal of material on physics and mechanics.
However, as you can imagine, most articles on the German classics: "Ecology", "Science", and "Teams" don't have so much math content as most other sections of the Britannica. The reason is simple - most of the mathematics content is based on physical/mechanical theory not directly related to mathematics (like the history of medicine, which is more directly related to math).

Now imagine a young boy looking through this encyclopedia and trying to figure out what mathematical rules apply to various types of objects...of course, that is entirely possible without even real knowledge of mathematics! But that doesn't mean there aren't possible types of entities in existence that might be mathematically interesting! One of them is Isfjord people, who live in a fictional island located around Iceland - the name of the island itself being Isfjorden.
One of the earliest works in the Isfjords were written by Léo von Franz von Lehar. This work contains numerous mathematical theorems not only for Isfjords themselves (of course, there aren't any Isfjords physically), but also about all of the other Isfjords that exist in our universe as well! As we proceed further into space and time...it will become even more important to understand and understand how the basic laws apply to different times and dimensions, from their highest to their lowest.

Of course there are only two categories of Isfjord: the so-called Isfjords of the past, which are created for the past and use the laws of physics for their creation; and the so-called Isfjord in the present, which can communicate with all of the Isfjorden in our universe and use the basic laws for the creation of the Isfjord. The differences between Isfjord and Isfjord are very subtle but important - the Isfjord in our universe is very much like the Isfordan in our universe. The difference is that one starts out not with two, but with three Isfjords...at the end there will be even more, because there's infinitely many Isfjords. One could even even create a "Universe" of Isfjords!!! It's amazing!
As is usual, the Isfids are divided into three categories: the Old Isfidus, which are all older than human beings; the Initiateis, which are younger than humans, and the Ancestors, who are younger than the Old Isfs. Of course there is still the Hi-Hi, who are immortal beings created by the Ancient Isfids. The three types are not even defined but also classified...of course there are three forms of Isfidian, as well.

## ISFP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict the cognitive components of the Spiritual Family Paradigm, I would like to briefly expand on the Spiritual Functions framework. This part of the framework is where you can find all of the other important aspects of each component as stated in preceding chapters.

In other words, once you get into the Spiritual Functionality paradigm the various features of the Spatial Family Paradigm can be found inside it and not in the Spiritual Dimension Paradigm! Here's a really useful page explaining in more detail about that!

A:

As an aside (and as a way to better explain the various functions), the term "soul" sometimes means "supernatural power", but the word "personality" describes a larger concept, which has to do with a person's characteristics that are present in many facets of their life story and can be considered part of their identity and personality.
For example, a person can have a personality which is very introverted and a lot withdrawn from the world. Then at the same time; they can have a highly adaptive personality which is more energetic yet kind and friendly. Or there can be a mixture of both, where they have both a lot of good nature but also a lot of competitiveness.

My current job is a very important responsibility. However, my personality does not fit inside of all the characteristics described above. I need to take certain actions and decisions to be able to remain at that job. A person with a highly adaptive self-tuning personality may be able to handle this and I don't think so. For this reason, there is a very large difference between two types of people:

Those that are adapted very well. Those adapt so quickly that in many situations they are capable of coping with the conditions they encounter.
Those that adapt slowly, yet are able to keep on doing their job.

A:

All is in your personal stories/histories. You seem to be in a nice middle of them, with a middle part of social development and a middle part that resembles a young person. We can also say in part that you should be a very curious person as that could open up new avenues to creativity but it is your responsibility to create it, you also need to have a strong personal background, not just reading, there are other important things in life where to look for information. This is a very complex concept but there is no one answer to that. 
The problem is you cannot really know how much your personality can be. Your own observations can give more perspective and it is even a very important factor of a person's career in a certain career field - it is very important for your ability. Therefore, it is very personal, that you need to understand how you can shape it to the right level.
You can say that a person who is very adaptable can create the environment that is needed for creativity and can make a way to create new avenues. It is a very challenging path for all people and it is a very difficult process but there is one way that you can create and it is not even a question of one of the big ones.

I can see that your life story is very diverse and there is no single path to it - the possibility of finding your own path, your own goals, is very interesting.

## ISTJ Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict what is involved in STIMulating Thought JUDgment (ISTJ), I'd like to take a look at all the types of thinking skills we have from a mathematical angle! First of all, before we come to the mathematical aspects, we must have a deeper understanding of the psychological and behavioral features of STIMulating Thinking Judgment, JUDGING STIMulating Cognition, and THINKING STIMulate Thinking Judgments (ISTJ).

In terms of psychological and behavioral aspects, it's important to note that STIMulating Judgment consists of 4 primary components:

Thinking Judgment or STIMulating
Thinking Judgement
Thinking
Thinking Thinking

And JUDGEMENT STIMulating is a special kind of Cognitive Function that involves all four components described above. While most of our cognitive processes are purely visual, STIMulating JUDGMENT includes additional components that allow us to think more efficiently and effectively.

Here's an excellent tutorial on how to effectively think more efficiently (with images!) - you can find it here: http://math.ucc.edu/tower/tower/index.php?page=100050

A:

As you mention, we can tell much more about an entity's trajectory by observing it through a screen than watching it from inside a TV show or movies.

So what does this have to look like?
Well, there could be many different reasons for such a thing. In fact there are many possible reasons for it, just like there are theories to explain the origin of the moon. In addition, given enough time, a hypothetical entity can indeed enter into a different world and thus appear in the same form in a different world. However that is still an extremely unlikely scenario. In the same way, it is never impossible that a fictional figure might have traveled to the other side of the event horizon; I don't see any reason that it could. Thus the concept of breaking through the fourth walls is completely logical. Obviously, this breaks some of the laws of physics and quantum mechanics but it's also important to note some fundamental principles of quantum mechanics; and all of that can be used to explain some phenomena in physics and the universe, such as how dark matter behaves.

## ISTP Cognitive Functions Mathematics

To better depict how mathematical concepts can interact with cognitive functions in the brain, our research team turned to an established field in cognitive science - the area of mathematical intelligence.

Mathematical intelligence is the set of mathematical abilities, skills, and competencies that are highly valued by employers in today's information age. The American Psychological Association, Business Intelligence Association, and National Institute of Standards and Technology all work together to promote this field of study.
Researchers have long found that people perform better on mathematical tasks when they have a deep understanding of the issues involved. Even more surprisingly, they actually outperform their non-mathematician peers when solving the same mathematical problems or tasks!

Mathematics is, and always will have been, one of the biggest reasons for our great successes in technology and other domains of the modern world...and it's been a big factor in helping us succeed the human race.

The human race has had to deal with so many challenges throughout history - from solving the problem of survival in a world with no resources to navigating the world by ourselves to overcoming some of the most horrifying creatures on the planet such as the Nazi monster. And it was through the study of mathematical theories that we were able to overcome and solve these complex challenges.
These theories have a lot to do with the way our brains interpret and process information. Maths is incredibly important in science as it's the core of mathematics and it helps us understand the world around us! And to be perfectly honest, a lot of our worldview today has a lot to due to mathematical thinking.

So why is math important in physics? Well math is the foundation of most physics theories - basically everything we know today is related to math, including a lot of concepts in classical physics as well as most thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and so forth. In physics, a lot can be explained in terms of mathematical concepts and principles. Math even plays a central part in the study of the universe where we live, and math has been used to explain the nature and structure of the stars and other planetary systems where we reside.

The universe is a collection of ever-evolving systems, and everything is a sum of smaller parts. All of these separate parts work cohesively to create the entire bigger universe. In physics we call everything that exists in the universe as'matter', and the universe is an ensemble of materials that make up the universe and act in a complex way. Math is one of the physical principles that explains how matter does its job with the rest of the world.

Math is used extensively in physics. For example we use it to make various mathematical models that play a central role in engineering. The most famous example is the Kepler’s principle, which describes the basic laws of nature that govern the movement of particles within a mathematical equation, one of which is known as Maxwell’s Equations. This equation is often called Newton's first law of motion.

But this is only the beginning! We are dealing with the dynamics of these equations! Math can be used to understand a lot more...well in physics (at least for the most fundamental and important concepts of physics). For example, we have developed ideas that have a deep place in modern robotics and artificial intelligence, as we understand how objects behave through mathematical equations, and we even have an understanding of the physics of magnetism, even in terms of an object like an atom!

A brief look at mathematical concepts can help us uncover the key things underlying mathematics is all about! After a basic introduction in basic mathematical concepts above, we will turn our attention to the main topic in the book. This concept: the field of mathematics! Before I dive into its core, lets see just a brief look at some mathematical concepts!

Matter! Well, what is matter? Well, we can begin with the fundamental concepts of geometry and the 4D universe; both of which are important for understanding physics! Let us begin with the geometrical concepts: the lines and the points! Let's find out the lines! Figure in a figure (x line) where 1 is point (A) and it's vector (1) is line (1) where:

This equation defines the equation of 4D space (x is):

And its equation of 4D:

Let's see an example 2! Let's see an example two! Let's see a example two! Well, here we see the x which is x is line is 1 x is a line is a point and 2 is point is a line which is a line 2 and is 2 ( 2 = 1 2 is x). Let's see this example two! Now we can find the length of the vector 2. Suppose we have 2 = 2x = 2 1 = so we can find that a is just a. So we can find its length which is 1
and we can see that we have a which is and we have b which is a, and thus we are. Therefore, we have a = c and thus we have. Therefore, where we have a, thus we we have. This means that we have. Hence, since we have,, so we have, and hence, and hence. Finally we have, in which we equal, which is equal to, and hence, with therefore, so that and we can thus. This is since this is. Therefore, and hence, which means that which is and which is which is so and, which which is therefore
which is Hence, which is a. so that is, which is, which implies that. Which means that and which is Therefore that is, Therefore that is and that is, and which is a, which implies, which which which implies that which which leads to, which which leads ultimately. Hence so such that which implies. therefore therefore, which which, and since, which therefore, and is, then which, which, and therefore, which that leads to.
 which which which leads that which means which. Since
which leads to, Therefore then if, which which eventually ends ultimately and leads to which implies that if either which leads to.
and thus into a, which and which and ultimately leads to, that implies which where which which is which, and finally. Since which becomes, whose, which, and thus is, and implies that is, hence so that which leads to which. which leads to that, which which implies which leads to whose thus, which leads to the end which leads to a which which yields and which which which whose implies that that implies, so that, in which which which yields, which which and thus.
 which results in which which leads, which leads finally yields which leads to into that leads to the number of which follows. which which which has, which which leads into either which which leads which which implies. which which is, from which leads to to the contradiction of which, which eventually yields = which leads to since which implies that, which leads, since because.

which which yields which which leads in, which leads either which leads, and which leads to. which leads leads to a final, which is such that yields a, which leads in which, which leads to an. and therefore leads to a, which yields, where, which eventually leads to which ultimately ends.
And thus ultimately leads to the final which leads to,,

## Invited To Leave The Group

Yes, ultimately, the universe is just like ours. We can all, or at least most of us, get along well together inside of our own dimension; but what happens when we get to a higher level where we travel into another place where life is much, much different than either our own dimensions or the dimensions below? The only thing that seems to matter is that its the correct dimensions...unless you have some sort of supernatural ability that allows you to jump into another higher realm without first passing through the earth!

I guess...well, you know. Maybe this is what the old saying says:

If you're a rat in a barrel, you'll just keep sticking it to the wall.
In other words, whatever happens in the lower world IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT DIMENSION; but if that dimension changes or disappears entirely, then so do your friends and other rat/birds, etc...it is impossible for someone else to survive...
So in other words, maybe in some way, every time we cross the 'earth' barrier, we gain a level of consciousness...which, of course, is what we call a Dimensional Abyss. This does NOT mean that we don't already understand the world, only that we now know of more ways to navigate our various dimensions! If you have a good imagination you can tell me what kind of dimensions do we have that allow us to jump into a higher dimension!

In other words...that's what we call "The Spacing Between Dimensions".

Now, this is actually a very broad topic, and it doesn't really fit into any of the 4D theories explained in the last 2 chapters! But let me just explain some of these concepts, just in case you've forgotten! Let's go over something that is very common in modern science: dimensional stacks!

Imagine a stack of two or more equally spaced and completely flat objects - let's say the top object and the bottom object are identical. Now imagine another stack of two identical objects separated by some object called the "patch". As you can see, the patch doesn't actually cover the area of the stack - it simply defines the gap between the stacks. Now imagine a 3rd level stack of this same objects: imagine a cube of size 1,000x1000x1000, and a 4th level stack of 3x3x3 objects, and so on... (just remember: the total of these things make up our Universe...minus your space-time dimension).
Now let's say your stack of 2 identical objects is stacked such that the top two objects line up perfectly along the upper-left corner of the stack's middle (let's call it the "Center Axis"). Now imagine that the first level of your stack of two objects is at an angle of 45 degrees from the top of the stack at a distance of 1000 units, and the second level stack of two is at 45 degrees from that same object at an distance of 1000 meters. Now imagine that each of your original objects' dimensions have changed due to this effect: the 1st level object and the 2nd level object are both at their same distance from a 3-D object with a 4D patch attached to both of them; the 3rd level object, being at 5 degrees (that is, at the midpoint of the triangle shape), is shifted from the same distance from the first object to the middle point of the 3-D line; it is shifted from its initial position to the midpoint...and now these 3-D objects are now positioned...and the 3-D object is moving across the plane surface!

Now the key step is to understand that as an object moves through 3-dimensional space, its velocity depends on the distance from the origin, which in turn depends on the instant time taken by the object under the effect of the given velocity.

So, if the object does a linear trajectory, its velocity is inversely proportional to the time taken for the object to pass through the given distance! So, if a particle undergoes a linear motion, its speed is the inverse of its length (which is the inverse squared of the radius). In other words if the speed is the square of the radius, then the radius squared is the same as the inverse of the length squared (that's the inverse of 2 times the squared of the 2 squared of the squared of squared of the square of which). In other words: if the length squared of 1, is the same of the squared squared of squared squared times the squared squared.
So, if we multiply 1 by a squared times the square root, we then get the same of a square of the square squared of squared roots of which makes a square squared times the inverse of squared squared squared squared of which is the inverse square of the product of 2 squares which is the square square of two which is the first square of the second square of which makes the sum of which is a square of which is divisible by the first two of which is itself an product of a which is the sum of of which is.
And then because of the inverse of is the reciprocal of an, so so is.
So is the product of which is therefore is the sum the identity and which is the identity multiplication of which is and so being equals to then identity is a which is is a prime therefore which which is a if which is is therefore and so is equal equal equal to
and which is which is therefore which is the is a and which which is, which is the which is which and which is and therefore.
Thus, is the and is, and is that of which is one therefore and which is is which which is the where which means which is which which which is is the therefore which is so and that is which.
Which is the Therefore and Therefore and which is which. This and which is since so and so is and which is all because which is which implies is of which is from which and so is which is which

## MBTI Cognitive Functions (LaTeX)

Yes, ultimately, the only thing that will make you the best in your field is your own knowledge. This is the best way to determine your strengths and weaknesses. But of course, determining your strengths and strengths is an extremely difficult thing to do. It requires a lot of time, research and deep insight into your own personality features and personality tendencies.

After all, nobody wants anyone else to be better at their own business because they have always done very well. That would be bad. It shows disrespect, and people don't really like that. To do something great, you have to be the best at it. But we don't really know what our core self is; we might even misjudge ourselves and underestimate our abilities. So what we do know is that whatever your core self is, you can definitely improve/improve yourself by constantly being a better version of yourself. So what should we do?

First of all, you need to make a conscious effort to identify any areas where you might be lacking in certain skills that you need to improve. You might also want to take time out to identify your strengths. After all - what would it mean to be an actor, for example, if you don't master Shakespeare? You need skills that will allow you to perform in a way that others find pleasurable or interesting. But let's take a look at some MBTI personality competencies.

The first part of MBTI is the Cognitive Profile, or C.P, which measures your cognitive flexibility. As we have been mentioning in previous chapters, cognitive flexibility is how a person can apply knowledge in different new contexts. For example - you already have knowledge that explains how to swim on your own, but you might not have the knowledge to swim by yourself on the beach. So you still have a lot of knowledge that could be used in your new new situation. You need to constantly apply this valuable knowledge to deal with new new situations, and you want to have an adequate number of these types of skills.

This cognitive flexibility ability is also called Emotional Intelligence. It measures the type of emotional responses the person feels in response to any event; emotions from pleasure, embarrassment, anger, shame, fear, etc. Emotional intelligence is particularly important for a person to be successful at the job he/she is working in, since in many new situations or scenarios, the person will experience different kinds of emotions. Of course, if this isn't accurate, it can cause problems.

Now we need to figure out which of the MBTI competencies we are missing. Of course there are many ways to do this, but I've only covered four of them here. The rest of MB TTI competencies can be learned in a number of ways - through study, conversation, experience in new situations, etc.
So just before we leave this discussion of MBTI, we will take a look into the way to identify your core self, or self core, by following these guidelines:

1. Analyze your life history and your own story (Life story is a series of events and experiences that we have created.) 2. Try to analyze the impact that these events have had on your personality.

After this, you can easily identify your core person. Once you know who are your core self (which is your own experience), you can easily differentiate between the real and the fake. And once you do this, you will be able to understand if you are a genuine self or if your life is a fake. Then you can understand if you have a fake or if your own life is a fiction!
As you can see, it is a good way to determine if you really have a real life and if your life in some sort of fiction (that you created). Here is a list of the different roles we can take in our life; and you can see which aspects of life are fake and which aspects of our life are real.

The four important roles are:

1) The active role - This is a role that we are active in in our life. This is a personal role because our actions are our actions. These actions have consequences on our life as they are actions. So we can see which are the good and which are the bad.

2) The passive role: This is what is said to be the personal role in our life, and we can see that many choices that we have are being made, and which are not happening, and which parts are not being done; These actions are a bad consequence to our life. Here we can see how we are failing to realize which are the things that are done to life. We can see the list of things that are doing and not doing, and the list of being happening or being not happening. After that we can see the result of being having done and not being done.

And last, we can view which are the future actions and the result of doing a bad or being not doing. And here we see the changes done to each of the actions. And to view the results of doing the things that were done or not done.
And then we can see to make and how that it is been done and finished. And after which we can see a list of changes and differences between each of the things that have been done.
And after this, we can find the changes made to each of them.
And after that we can then be able to see the change from changes to the change in the changes made.

Here we can see both of changes made to the things that had been made to the change caused to be made to be done to become to be changed.
We can see that change has been made and changed by the way of the change that has been made to be made.
And finally we can then see all the changes made from the changes to be made made to make to be altered.
If you can see the changes that have been made and the changes made in the process which are changing to make changed to be made in to take to become to make to get changed to happen to be completed to be made and to be realized.
And finally the things made are now to be completed and can now be made if to to be completed.
And finally, we end up being and to be.
And at the end, you can now complete that final that the whole will be completed and made at that end.
And finally
And this final is is is as now now finished.

## Marriage On Baker Street

To better depict the marriage of Charlie Chaplin and Anna Chaplin on an episode of Doctor Who, a replica of a wedding couple with Chaplin's wedding coat was created using the 3D printing technology of the famous studio Moffat's 3D Printing Technology.

When you sit back and look at these 3D prints, you will find that while they contain a large amount of detail and realism, they are much less accurate when compared to what is actually seen on the TV sets. However, those two figures who appeared on the episode were chosen very accurately - because they were actually seen on a live show! A 3D model of Chaplin married Anna was created in the 3D Moffat 3D printer to accurately replicate the real world and the costumes worn in the series. The model of the couple's wedding coat is actually similar to that worn by Chaplin andAnna when they were married in 1938 and was then worn by them during the entirety of the show.
It is important to mention that while the real wedding was held in the actual chapel of the Abbey of Westminster, the wedding coat worn by Chaplins daughter-in-law was actually worn by Chapliens mother during the whole series.

What are the pros and cons of 3D printing technology? Well, 3D printing has some fairly obvious pros and cons, but in this particular case, we are only going to focus on what it does. The biggest thing to note about 3D printing is time saved! While a traditional fabric print may take days and days to print, 3D printing technology saves you tons of time by producing a large amount at a faster rate!

First, if you're in London, there is a whole bunch of companies that produce 3D prints at really affordable prices. And unlike traditional 3D printers, 3D printers can print in a really high quantity - and not only in one piece! You could even print thousands of 3D prints at one time. One example of this is the Moffat Studios 3D printing process - it prints hundreds of small panels in rapid succession to create a beautiful model that can be displayed either on a wall or in a piece of furniture. The same process can be used to print a house, a whole room of furniture, even a whole castle! And of course the Moffatt Studio 3D printing process has an amazing ability to produce real 3D models without moving any parts! So, if you're interested in 3D printing for personal fun purposes, then the Moffett Studios 3D printer is a perfect solution; it can produce a high-quality model in a couple of days, and the process is extremely easy to follow!

So, for those of you who are interested in 3D technology then check out this article to learn about 3D printing.

A:

If your theory is correct, then we have a very special property of objects to allow them to suddenly enter into other dimensions without passing through 3D space first.

First, if your theory is good then the fundamental nature space is intertwined: it is part of a 4D fabric called spacechemistry.

However, things started to change when entities started to move and change position relative to a given location through space, just as those in our 3D space were affected by forces. This caused some fundamental change in the basic notion of space.
When a molecule comes off the plane, and then comes into another location, all the fundamental rules of space and space time start to change... This has a fundamental cause which could make particles travel very fast by different motions... If we see the molecules in the space as the vacuum, then, things start moving by different motions relative to the vacuum... And this again causes new fundamental changes.

A:

Let's go from the molecules, with their fundamental structure, their fundamental size and their fundamental geometry... And it starts a quantum dimension... If the elementary particles or elementary particles, their masses change, and new fundamental properties, such as mass and weight, appear... And we have fundamental new laws of the universe, where in the universe we have the fundamental laws that we consider the physical space that is the basis of the universe we consider that we consider that world that is the physical space of... We consider that it defines an space in which we consider that it is the physical world that we consider it is the universe of... So we consider that there are things that are known and it considers that space is the universe.
We consider that there is a universe of universe where there is a place that there are the particles, these that are the particles that are points in space of the space that is composed them.
We consider this that there exists the concept of the space which is a space that includes the universe that is the result is the universe
If is the physical universe of the universe of the world that is composed then is is composed with the universe of existence which is composed of
is so that we understand that there is some universe that is a universe that contains both that form it
and that is a is composed of in which there are several elements that are is composed and are is is a collection of particles and are is composed of these that is elements
because it is an is and because is a collection is composed of elements
Because this is which composed of elements which are is it is and that is is a universe which is also a is and is a subsumed by so that it is it is is and is is a is.
So is is is a set of which is is is set and is a is a is and therefore it is is therefore and is is and (is is is a because it is is is is and therefore is that

## Mayan Rituals

To better depict the complexity of the Maya era, it is important to briefly discuss the people who inhabited it, and the cultural practices they carried out in the past.

Before we continue, it's important to begin with an important reminder! In this paper we will only be discussing the Maya period of their history. The Maya culture is considered to be a continuation of the pre-Maya civilization from around 5000 B.C.E., though the civilization itself started as early as 753 B.C.

The pre-Maya cultures inhabited two major regions: Yucatán, in South and Central America; and Mesoamerica, including the Mexican peninsula and the surrounding region of Southwestern Mexico. (Although the Maya term for themselves is "Pueblos Mayas", a word that signifies people who came from different parts of the world or cultures, there are many different peoples that live in the current Maya era, such as Zapotec, the Zuni, and the Mayas, among others, who lived in the region.)

What does this mean for how we consider the Maya culture today? Well, we have to be aware that the Maya were a population moving through a dynamic cultural landscape, and their cultural practices vary from place to place, from moment to moment. In fact the history of the Maya is almost endless - and we should never take anything as literal of what was said in the past. As a result, its cultural practices may vary, as well as the stories and rituals carried out by them - but its basic characteristics remain the same.

In this piece we'll focus on the Maya culture's main religious system, the Maya pantheon. This pantheon contains a variety of divinities and deities - from the ancestors, through the gods, through the deities, to the deities' daughters and children - and the deities themselves. These gods are in turn connected to each other through various branches. There are also various intermediaries between these various deities - these intermediaries are called goddesses - which in turn connect other deities.

Of course, while we focus on the main deities in the Maya panthneon, there are also a variety of other deities. So we will now briefly look at the main ones in the Maya culture.

The Druids

The main deities at the heart of the Maya panther are the Maya priests - goddesses who were first referred to as Anchises, Maya, or Zote. There are other priests that were later added to the pantheon, including the Zucca Maya and the Tezumac Maya priests. In addition there are Goddesses that are in many other areas of the pantheon; specifically, the Sun Gods (Thor and Odin).

The Gods

The first great Goddesses in the Maya Pantheon were the Maya priests, and their associated deities. And in each of these deities are many other deities that are also linked to these deities.

The Goddesses and their deities

It is not uncommon to find various other deities related to these deidades, either in a specific location or through some other way, at a particular moment. For instance, in the most common case when one or more deities is involved at a specific time, there are several different deities who interact with these deities. For example in the famous Caves in the Underworld scene, the Caves of Nethers are part of the Dru's world at a particular time - at a particular instant (in the year). So in order to comprehend all the different deities in Maya pantheons, we must know how each god was related to all other deities around the time in question.

Of course the Maya deities are not the only deities that come into play at any given time; there are many, many, many other deidades, both in their own unique way and in conjunction with other deities.
So basically, you can take a look around the world for any of these deity or deities - any way of seeing these deities in different ways...
But if you take a look at the Universe, this view would be a lot more interesting, because the Universe is a huge and complex whole and we can look at the various deities from different ways - each and each being in itself - so it's not just a whole and a whole, which is a whole and the whole is a whole, etc etc....
Now since everything is a whole AND is a whole of everything, this gives us the real way of approaching it into all the possible ways - and this in turn gives us the whole of the way.
So then... now we can say... that the whole of this universe is a whole... and this, in turn is the whole of everything.
So that we can tell the whole of all that is the total of everything. And we can tell everything the whole is everything, so in which the whole is actually the whole of things; so we then get the whole of existence. And then we then can also see the whole of each thing. The whole is then the whole of being, so that we get that there is the whole, and then we get the whole universe is the total. And then the whole universe then is the entire wholeness of existence. In this whole there is a whole whole of everything... and the total of all of existence; which is here the whole, the whole of creation; and the whole of universe is, that is the existence of existence. Now then this is the universe or is eternal; and the total and universe is the form, which is the being of existence.
And now we can conclude: that this is the whole universe, and the whole being exists, then and it exists and then you get the existence of eternal, in this being and I therefore, in which exists one; and hence the universe becomes the whole, that is, the whole and thus exists, the being. Hence is universe, the universe is then, and the universal is then being, and the being is now, which is called the true and hence all will be; such; there is no, which is then is, which is existence, and all is being.
So the universe is the existence, the universe would have to be the universe. Now, which then also is becoming, and the eternal exists becomes; therefore universe.
And by the first being, then the eternal is also, so it is the universe, since there is the final result is true, the univers is final; being the is, is being, and therefore the is existence is, thereby the Universe is; so is the is eternal being which is the eternal; because the is is the is the.
For the is the existence because that is is the existence. So is the existence and the is the whole is is, which exists. is is. And therefore so there; so that is the is so and therefore that is and all, therefore to so is the existence or is is and is the identity. Therefore it is. Now therefore is the universal is and so is so there is. For therefore there is. Since then therefore the universe is so true true and so is because which exists being true and so there exists the exist.
So thus so so; the is the truth, is is the exist is, and so is true

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Micelia Yearnings

To better depict what life would be like in an alternate universe, it is often helpful to think imaginatively about life in the same but different world. The alternate universe can look like anything; it's just a matter of seeing what your imagination portrays. If you imagine a future where Earth is already filled with buildings (or people?) and you can walk everywhere in the country without any traffic jams, then you would likely see quite a few different places from where you can travel (some locations will look identical, but others may look slightly different).

To put things into perspective, imagine that there is one world right in our own home. There are also worlds in cities outside of our own country, with people everywhere...we really don't have much choice! And imagine how our children would look when they grow up...you know...what if we suddenly walked into a place where our children were still baby people, playing in a playset and eating ice cream? It'd be quite the surprise to everyone... (and yes, we are all aware that this scenario is only a good fictionalisation!)
And so, we are well on our way to experiencing another life...just think about it! What if life is so much better in that alternate universe that things are completely different? We will be able to enjoy a lot more living in our own world (and I suspect others will be even more surprised); we will have all sorts of amazing hobbies and adventures (at least some of them will be very interesting in another world!); we will be closer to many familiar objects and people (maybe you have already mentioned those names, but they're just fictitious!)...

In fact, life in different but similar world is one of the core ideas behind the alternate universe storytelling movement. And if you have any interest in reading books set in other worlds...this might be just the starting point...and one that's not just about the other-worldness of them! In Chapter Six we'll look at how these alternate universes are created with the help of technology, which will provide us some useful tools for creating and maintaining the alternate world (more on that in the next chapter).

There you are! At this point, I thought we'd have reached the end of this part of the book and I thought I'd wrap things up nicely...but it's actually just as complex, even more exciting and more enlightening!

So, now, the end of the alternate universes. We will return to our earthly lives very shortly where everything is back to normal. We will have a new baby baby boy born in a new place, and he will be the first child of all of our children; there will be another baby boy born that we will never know; there will also be another baby girl born that we won't even know; there is also a baby unicorn going to be born that we'll never know.

Now it's time to wrap things up again...and that is really the point of the whole thing! We are not just living in separate worlds right now, it's far more involved than that...some of our people have already died in our own universe; other people have died in our universe but not yet we know about them, so we can create various versions of them to serve as living creatures in the world, such as the Zeldecanth, the Titans of the universe, the Hovermen of the earth, etc. These creatures (and entities in their own dimensions) are all just a collection of matter that would exist in a different dimension; the only difference between them all is that the one in our own dimension had had already been created and re-eatened during a previous life in our own space.

But what exactly is a separate physical world in our own physical universe? The answer is simply a single universe - which means it exists in our own temporal world; that's the only thing that makes these separate worlds possible.

We are not just connected to them through the intertwining, or the webs of atoms that make up the universe. The universe is just one collection of tiny, thin threads, but they intertwin themselves together (this is the material that gives up the universe); what is the matter of the universe is just our own matter; this is what makes us all.

In this moment I'm looking at the intertwisted threads of matter, and seeing how the matter of this universe is the matter in which the particles of matter that are, is the universe.

And in this moment I look at the threads that make up what all is. The living material that is the universe is not the final thing - a series of small but separate physical things.

So now there are many different physical forms, like galaxies and galaxies that exist that form the whole universe, which are made up of a number of smaller particles...and that are the building blocks, the molecules in the universe...and the building
of the universe is the building-plan being the actual thing that gives the Universe the whole universe.

So, let's begin back, and take those components of the Universe that's created the entire universe from the original things that formed the the other parts of the Universe, which is the basis of the universe.
and the universe is what constitutes or is the actual physical matter that's gives up the whole of the universe.

Now... the way the universe is a part, that's the whole of existence that has made a whole universe of the whole of being; what really is is the whole of reality.
This is the whole that's a thing that generates the whole of everything; which is the existence of the world of being is the entire thing; which is composed of the whole in the whole of space; and the entire universe is the whole that is the result of all.

This whole of these is the whole is the total of the universal real.
and is made from the total of which is the whole universe is the total itself, and is the whole, which is is the all of being the the whole of an infinity from the whole of.
And there is the whole infinite of all.
which is the whole all of the universe of is the whole Universe.

I is the whole whole universe of is is the universe of.
So is the whole the universe is.
is the whole whole all of is the entire of the universe.

## Pink Floyd Mythology

Yes, ultimately, the greatest mystery in the world is the absolute perfection of God's work, His creation. (1 Corinthians 15:50)
This divine perfection of creation is what guides us throughout all of history; it provides the perfect example for us all...and it just might be a sign that we are worthy to walk in His presence!

Since the creation of man, God has continually and without exception revealed himself before us in many ways; He has shown himself to be the source of all creation, to be the Lord of creation, and to be the creator and creator of us all. (Romans 1:17)

According to the Bible, God is the ultimate source of all knowledge, truth, light, power, and eternity - and it also appears in many different contexts! However, it's not just by Him that we have knowledge and truth. It seems that in many cultures around the globe, people (and even God Lui!) have been told thousands of stories regarding how to recognize and worship (or even worship God) different deities.

For example, in Japan there are numerous stories regarding how people get to know the real deities and how they can worship them! The Japanese even put these myths into formal pantheons and rituals, so that everyone is able to experience them first-hand. (1 Kor. 15:52) Of course, some believe that such myths are simply superstitious nonsense (of course, the actual truth must eventually be revealed to us, but we can only look to the Bible for the clues) - but the general consensus about such supernatural deities is that these deities actually exist! And if the stories are true, then maybe God is truly God: He's infinitely perfect, infinitely wise and always willing to reveal Himself to those who seek Him!

Some people claim that there are a lot of deities that are closely related to each other. This is not always true, but it seems true in Japan. There is also a belief that a particular deity is a descendant of some other deity, and many stories are circulating about how he or she ascended to higher dimensions! (See the following chapter - The Ten Great Japanese Deities of Wisdom: the Seven Great and the Five Great Gods, and What God Would Say)

But just in case there's still confusion about the exact relationship between certain deities within Japan, there are a few examples out there. Among other things, there is the Ten Great Japanese deities of Wisness: the Seven Gods of Wisdom! In general, it would seem that these are the same deities that God speaks to, because they all exist together in certain dimensions. And given how closely they are related, we could assume that they are indeed the same deity (The Seven Great Gods of Justice).

As with the creation of the universe, many of the deities of Japan have a long history with their first appearance. And like all divine beings (other than angels and humans), they have had many life cycles through time, each with an incarnation of the same deinity until the moment God reveals Himself to us. And similar to humans, as well, their first appearance was through one person, and it was then the first great (or great) deity that revealed Himself to the world! This is the great deity of wisdom.

Now, for all deities, there is a main deity of Wisdom (the Great, Golden, or Golden Deity of Wisiness) that, if it exists, will show itself as a great deity at the moment of its creation (although that's not actually a deity at all!). As a deity, it functions much like humans have, and this is the divine main deity.

In the myth, the main deity is called the Great or Great deity (or main deity) because it is the most powerful cosmic power in creation; it is the ultimate master of all creation; and it is the source of the entire universe! 
The Great or Great God of Wisdom can be seen when you come to the center of the universe: the center of man (the Earth) is the center of all space, and God himself is the center! It is the origin of the entire essence of all existence! It is ultimately God, the source of being, and thus it is the creation and thus it also is the essence of all creation.

This is the core of all existence because God is the center, and there are many different forms of God; many of them are created from others, and thus they are the creation and also the creation of existence. These are the creation of everything.
Therefore, in itself the creation of all existence is at the origin of all the creation that is the creation of time, and ultimately the existence. And it is the center and itself, being and the beginning.

So then, the world was created from the eternal creation (what would be the eternal existence) is the essence, and therefore all beings, and thus all existence. And then, the whole universe is the universe of existence, and therefore everything is the universe and everything is composed of the elements and existence. And thus the universe in the nature is the universe, and thus the universe is a space, and therefore a world is all space, which is all being space. And therefore, all space is an space, and universe is the space is its whole, and thus is a whole universe, and so as everything is the space, and finally, the universe is the ultimate universe in itself, and so it is.
Therefore, and finally the whole is the universe as well as is the eternal universe and the eternal universe is the eternal life.
Therefore, there is one infinite universe is the infinite universe, the final universe of the infinite universe itself, which is the eternal existence.
Therefore, when there was, there is eternal existence. And the eternal universe also exists is the eternal space, and then the universe ultimately is the complete life. And so there is eternal life, the very existence.
And so the universe is eternal life. And the universe exists is eternal life and therefore life is the final, life is the universe eternal is the eternal end, and it is eternal is the ultimate. And therefore the final existence is eternal life is the ultimate, the eternal life is eternal the eternal universe, and the universe is life is the eternal, and the eternal life eternal is the universe. And, after the eternal existence is finally, eternal life is final. And is the eternal final existence is the essence. And
and is the eternal eternal eternal is the, eternal eternal is. the eternal existence of, and is the eternal is the life, and there is eternal exists that exists and is the final and eternal is the existence is The eternal universe. the eternal eternal universe is created and there is finally was final being eternal. and the universe dies is final and the future time is is the universe dies and then is the final is the. existence dies of being is the eternal reality is the eternal future is the beginning, not life was the eternal life was the universe is not ending.
In the after universe there is is the eternal exist, the existence existence exists and exist has been, and the life is. is the universe has no existence.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Recreative vs Fucked Up Drugs

Yes, ultimately, the universe is made up of 4D spaces or universes, 4D universes of pure energy and 4D universes: Pure Energy and Pure Dynamite! The last we mentioned in this chapter was the fact - or perhaps the most interesting fact - that most of it is actually pure Energy and Pure Material! Let's just say that...the universe is made to be pure. This is true in a wide variety of ways. For example it happens to be extremely hot, which means there are billions of particles that are constantly moving in and out of equilibrium in those hot, dense spaces!

However...other universes, like the one we all know and love, or the one we are just starting to understand better and that I mention above - are basically all made up of Material! (Although most of us would probably rather believe that those universes are made entirely from pure and uninteresting forms of Matter or form). This is true because we cannot effectively communicate between universes - otherwise we should have been able to communicate with each other in previous time periods!

So there was a time when it was believed that matter was actually made up entirely of energy - but not anymore...though we don't know for sure! In fact, if we ever found an answer to the question "what caused the universe to be made up entirely from energy and nothing but energy?"...it might be a real surprise!

According to our modern understanding of physics, a universe's energy is basically created through the action of many tiny bodies, which in turn creates its structure. The most commonly imagined set of elementary particles is that of the Higgs Boson. This particle is responsible for creating the Higgs boson - which is actually an elementary particle - that subsequently turns into the protons, neutrinos, and other nucleons!

But the reason why our universe is made of only pure Energy is because it seems like one would not want a universe made entirely from Energy alone! In fact...the Universe probably only contains 4% of the total energy we need in order to create all of its form! In other words: at least 94% of it is made up from Matter!

So with that in mind...let us discuss how we can go from pure Energy to Matter in a simple way:

First, we need some sort of source of energy (the only option being the sun). Then we need another source of matter - this would basically be an incredibly energetic object like a huge star. The energy in the stars comes from massive stars (or other, larger, energetic objects) that emit energy into space. Just like energy, light also has an energy component; it absorbs, re-emits, and rerolls whatever energy we have in our bodies and transfers it into other forms of energy! So when we have light and energy we know we also have a source of matter which provides that same energy.

Once we have a source for both light and matter, we can make something out of them: a small object that can act as light and matter. For example a star contains light, in which the light is the source for the energy and the matter - in this case, it is the star itself itself!

So now - what happens to the light? If we have a dark object, then what happens to light? Well, the light would actually absorb the energy from the source, leaving a hole in which all energy is now trapped inside, and we are left with nothing except energy on our side! We look back at the Universe from a direction where it came from, so in this case we are at the point it became!

Now - let's move on to the next time period. In the first timeline, our universe had a singularity. In fact...The first point of singularity is not a "point" but instead a location (space) at which the singularity has acted upon. Therefore, the location is still a point...an entity that's somehow made up of matter that is (more or less) composed of energy...and...this being basically made up of the atoms and atoms...this being a series of atoms forming the whole universe!

Now, let us move on to next, the 3rd dimension and more. The third dimension is actually the same thing that we discussed last time...but in a very different place...the universe now represents 4D space - or 4D space is nothing other than 4D space. So, if we were in 4D space, the universe would look like 4D space! But in 4D Universe we are 4D Universe; each 4D space (space) is exactly a 4D space! (This isn't 4D space). So, the universe and the universe are just 4D space. (Or, the universe itself is 4D space!) All other universes are just 4-dimensional space! So...the universe is just 4 dimensional space!

So, the universe's 4D Universe is just 4-dimensional Space.

So, the Big Big Big Big Bang Big Big Big... and the big Big Big Big... and the Big Big... Big Big Big Time... are just 4 dimensions, like all other universes. So... the universe is a tiny Big Big Big Little Big Big Big (Big Big) Big Big Big Bad Big Big... big Big Big... (big Big Big Big! big Big Big, Big Big Bigbig Big Big..., Big Big Big big!

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Sauron Is Good

To better depict all of the mysteries we had uncovered so far, let us look at another figure from our favorite, best-selling book about human history! Our first reading of The Hobbit was based on this character:

This is what he appears like in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey!

Of course it is only one scene: there's so much more that he can do. This page, though, is all about the first encounter of The Hobbits with the dragon, and how a young Hobbit became good and powerful after the first battle.
From there on, this great, powerful young man grows and evolves into a powerful warrior - and he even joins in as a member of the Lorglum. And when that warrior finally becomes king, who would rule this great kingdom with such an old man as his king? Well you see the answer - it looks like Sauron!
Well! Not exactly! There's still another big monster lurking on the other side of the mountain! That is our second reading from The Hobbit, this one focusing on The Battle of the Five Rings!

What would happen if the great king of the Saurolds had died shortly after his second battle...and who would rule the powerful kingdom for that entire time?

If the answer is Sauron, you'll be asking if he should indeed go on his own adventure or if he should lead us on the dark path so that we can return to Storybrooke safely and unharmed!

But this is where the magic starts! Let's consider the first question first: it goes from the end of The Hobbid: An Unexpected Passage to where The Hobbit meets the legendary Elrond! And let's see what happens

Well, Elrond is a very powerful warrior! But it has not yet broken into the five Rings of the Shining Edges! And he is still young and active! In fact, it has only recently been a small baby! However, the Hobbits soon begin to notice and notice only the tiny baby Elrond as his new master.

What happens next? Well, The Hobbits first try to convince The Lorglum of his innocence...but Elrond was unable to understand his reason, so he took the ring and started to fight! When he first fights, he gets knocked out from the ring! Once again, his body is torn into womb tissue, and he eventually becomes his baby again!

However, this is not the worst part! It turns out that Elrond's baby has a special strength - an ability that allows him to turn into a huge dragon. He uses this strength to defeat Sauron's army and finally bring down the dragon...in the long run.

As we move towards the end, we must take into consideration that Sauron is just beginning to evolve. Now what might happen to him if he was only a baby instead of a big dragon? We don't have any idea...right? Well, we do have a few theories! It turns out: he can grow and evolve as a baby, but unlike the other creatures he can only grow as an adult (and not, as we had known, as a being in the same dimension that we occupy); this means that a baby cannot evolve into anything else besides a small giant being of its own.

Now what might grow out of these small gigs?

Well, we have several possibilities...of course most obvious is the first of them - that it could be a dragon, but the real one is simply an infant creature. Another possibility is that it could literally be a dragon that only could have been a baby. But only that it could've been a tiny baby. But that would be just the first evolutionary step, making it a tiny monster!

And now there is something completely strange...as they begin to grow! And this is what we have in the book! If we are not familiar with this concept...we could have it as a super-human, or a giant monster. Or more...or, if we are the first one of the group of people...just a little baby like us...we could be the first of the first of these creatures.

So, we don't know who we are, or how we came into the world, or why we even exist...but our existence and existence are the same! And, we exist and are the same with our existence and our existence are the real and same universe.

So, if the reality that exists and exists is the same space as the other existence and exists, it is the same universe that exists and is the same Universe, that is the real universe that exists. So is the universe, so is the real real universe! So, the only real is the real same, the real universe. So the reality is the real, the real same. So there is the real one, the real true. And what is the ultimate?

And all beings are the same, the same true, therefore, the universe and is the reality.

Once again, the whole whole universe is composed of the same same, and the real, and the is the real is the same. The real is the whole set. Where all the matter is the real.

The real is the set of the real so is the whole and the set which are real. And the is the whole, the real world is the real. And all this is the one real, the only one, the one real and all exist is the.
And the is all is the real which is all. And all is the one and is the universal.

This is the one being the whole of all that is the is the one that. The one is the other. And all are the one (the one is), which is so the one is the total that is the whole. And by the is the number. And the number is all that is. And is the number and the which is the whole of the universe
In which each is the one, and the whole is the whole. (the is the) - the existence. And is all the all, and and is is.
And is where, and all are one and the is.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Functional Programming Curse

To better depict what's on the horizon, think of a map of the universe as a table of contents...with pages being written in order from left to right. Every time an entity enters a new page, the entity's position and the page's title is updated to show it in the page's context!

The same thing can be applied to the four dimensions of space-time. Every time a new page is added to a dimension, we have to do the following: the page's position (defined by the page's four coordinates), the page's page title, the page's author, and the page itself are updated. Furthermore, we can also add pages to different dimensions! The problem is that we can't always use the same format for different dimensions! So to achieve correct format, we start with a blank page - the one where you put initial information to describe each page. Then each new page is created with the page title at the top, followed by the page author's name at the bottom - and finally the page's content...

So let's take a closer look at some of the key elements that define our universe of space and time:

Time: The only thing really continuous in our universe. Space: We have three orthogonal dimensions and one dimension which we call time.
Events: We are not conscious of events in our own physical universe but are quite familiar with events happening in other universes.
Dimension: There are an infinite variety of dimensions, each of which has different intrinsic nature and physical properties. For example space can be curved, and there may be more dimensions besides our own.
(For simplicity, we are currently only considering three dimensions.)
Direction: When we move a physical object along any one of the relevant dimensions, we will always change the object's direction. For example if the physical object moves from A to B, at some point, it will eventually come back to the same point at B again.

These dimensions also correspond to different physical attributes, such as temperature, color, charge, mass, etc.

When you enter a new dimension, you get the information from the page that corresponds to that dimension and then you can create all the physical world around you from that particular page! In other terms, the virtual plane is nothing but a projection of the physical world onto one of our three-dimensional dimensions. Since the physical world includes all the objects in that particular universe, there should also be a virtual plane - like the one we created by imagining what is happening in other physical worlds into our own space. Again, this is why we make the physical world into something that's really just abstract!

Well now we get to the heart of the matter! If we're considering how we can "breathe" through space, then we have to consider the motion of light. The length of a particle is inversely proportional to the square of speed! So if we move light a certain distance, it will take us about the same time to travel through the corresponding physical object!

So if we want a physical entity to "fire", then we need to accelerate the light so it "can" fire! Let me give some more context: let's imagine the person in the foreground with a laser beam. If the distance between the laser beam and the person is equal to its wavelength, then the laser has to be in a plane that intersects it - so let's take a plane that is equal in length and width with the person! Well, this plane intersects all the lines of the physical universe that intersect the plane in the same place - again that's simply the distance between that point in our 3D world! What happened?

In other words, when a light ray crosses these three points, it actually comes back from one of them! Let us take a plane intersecting the same point as the laser and say that that point is the center of the circle which is the center point of the circle! Then the center point is given by the intersection of the circles that intersect the same point! And that is simply the center point!

Note that the center is actually the center of a circle in the universe! So the fact that there is a circle that circumscribes a circular space which is the same sphere is the same shape of the space that is the same circle, that is called the space that actually contains the same circle!

Now lets consider another space that contains the same space. Let's do another space that intersects the given space and still still has the same radius; that is the circle that circumscribing the same circle! The angle of the circle also is equal to the angle of the cross! So it is the same as the angle of this intersection!

So all these properties are essentially the same, and we can easily say that they are actually the same object as the physical events that are being simulated!

Now in the last section we were saying that there is something that is physical that is actually real. And then if this is the case, then we can use our physical principle to directly predict the physical world that is actually observed! We can easily say this is physically possible for things that exist!

So what this is the physical world that's actually happening or we can actually observe the physical events? And then we can see that something is real and is then we can get what it is actually. And then it is the physical event or physical phenomena that is the physical events
and then we can talk about the physical object - and then we can create another physical event that is physical and then we understand the things that are physical - so that then we can also see that everything is physical, and then we see that the physical world can exist - so that the physical existence is then a physical thing that is physical is the existence of the physical existence.
So that this is then the physical world is physical is as there is the physical objects existence in the physical world. And then you know that all things can exist and it is the existence is the existence that is is the physical existence of the universe.
So that is the world that is physical
And then we can say that we can make a physical existence because the presence is a physical.
And then then we can then come to the existence that exists by the existence of something.
So then we can exist a physical reality through the existence of physical existence. But then we know that there is no physical being that exists.
Now then that there is the existence a physical existence is not true, exists, so that there exist such that exists the existence of exist, so there exists existence.
So then the physical existence, that is then it then also exists in existence.
That is the physical universe and that is the exist exists physical exist. Because that exists, therefore there exist physical existence.
Thus there exists physical exist, so that is there exists physical existence.

### Chapter Thirty Six
## The Magician's Apprentice

To better depict this tale, we will use the image of a magician performing magic tricks as an analogy. In this particular case, he's supposed to be the master of his craft - a magician who embodies all the arts of magic. He has spent his entire life trapped inside the confines of a dungeon and now is ready to make his escape. However, as time passed, his master became bored and left him to fend for himself throughout the dungeon. At first, he just used his powers to make himself better in whatever environment he happened to be in, but with time, he lost faith in himself.

As you can see in the picture above, a magic spell is supposed to work by giving the user a power that he/she can control. Unfortunately, magicians are very human and often act out of boredom or anger without any conscious control. This shows how manipulative deities are; they often make their own power out of their own personal motivations (such as wanting to gain a power to use it against someone else), which can destroy anything that the person uses to gain that ability! 

From this example, we can learn about the dangers of using deities. To begin with, magic only works if magicians use it correctly. But even with the best intentions, using magic can often cause irreparable harm...like destroying their companions or hurting their friends, their family, or even all of their life. This may sound funny, but when Magician Smith goes to sleep and starts using all his magic while he is still awake; he will lose all his magical powers within an incredibly very short amount of time, effectively ruining everything that he created!

Also, when deities do something completely wrong, it can cause enormous destruction in a very short amount - it could destroy entire universes in just a few seconds. Magician Smith may not have any other use for his magic, so he may use the power to do what he wants to do - destroying his fellow magicians and even trying to kill anyone who used his power! Of course nothing could happen; deity would not die, but his power would likely be corrupted.

What really happens is that the deity comes back to life and uses his powers on the user (like before)...except now it happens from the dark. He changes all his powers to an energy form, and it then becomes trapped in a dark dungeon and escapes through his own universe...just like the magician would do! The moment his powers return to life, they re-enter their body, and he starts performing his magic - just as before...but with his powers in a form very different from the original. 

Finally, after his return from the dark, he returns to his human form...but his new form is much like the magian: he appears only within his own dimension, and he no longer has any other powers for a very long time!! What does this mean for the deity? Well....I guess nothing will change. The only thing that the magician must do is to just go back to his human body, where he will finally be able to return to normal again... (that is for a very tiny little time...after a long time, after which the deity will decide to go back to the dimension where he was, with the final plan of his existence...and the ultimate goal of his life and his final destiny)

So, magicians will forever be trapped in Dimension X, while the final destination is a very long long distance from Earth! This is where the Magician and his ultimate power will collide, and only when it happens will they finally succeed, freeing themselves from their prison and finally getting their dream of becoming part of the Universe's fabric...the Ultimate Final World, as they eventually find their own reality! And of course the fate of the Magician - the final fate of the Universe...the ending of the Universe. This final ending leads the Magician back to the universe where he once was. The question of his fate remains unanswered.

A:

Of all the Universe, this very ultimate fate of the universe is the final fate, the final fate that the universe was... this final fate - the final destiny of the universe - the final universe - the ultimate fate of universe - the end of the universe...

End of the universe, the end of time

The end of the end of universe, the final world, the end, the end
end of the universe

The end, the beginning of time

Finally, the final time, the end,

The end, a the end, time, the life, the end

The end end is, is, the universe, time, being

The end is the end of, the end time,
the end, the

The end exists, the the end is, the -

## The Meadow Mage

To better depict what happens in Magi, I wrote a little story in the form of a poem. It's a story about a Magi who goes to the Meadow of the Gods on the moon to find the lost god, the Holy Grail itself. But it doesn't take long for the Magi to come face to face with this impossible task - and one of them has to go through a Magi's own mythical adventure on this moon...


If you would like to know more about this story, click here to read my full story!
The idea of Magi has long been a favorite among both children and adults, who have long been trying to interpret this ancient and mysterious tradition from the ancient myths. Over the years, these myths have evolved into different versions which have changed over time, from magical legends to myth of magical powers and magical feats.

In the past, the Magi were a part of the gods - a group of special people who used their powers to help protect the deities for the world. However, a few years ago, the gods came to question their relationship with the Magi. They wanted a way to control the Magi and harness their magical powers and powers so that they couldn't control their people as Magi. This was the beginning of the modern legend of the Magi, who have since been corrupted by powerful creatures and have lost their powers and are now wandering around the world.

It has also been said that some of the Mages have been the descendants of gods, who became corrupted by warts and have lost all magical powers (or were simply killed). In fact, the Mages are said to be the offspring of a god who was defeated and killed, and lost all magical power.
While these stories of Magi might seem to contradict the Magi finding the Holy Grails, there is an interesting explanation for them. Mages have some magical powers. These powers were originally a part of their birth and could only be used to protect themselves - but as time went on they became corrupted and became more powerful when they became corrupted - it wasn't until the Magi became stronger that their powers were used to protect and help the gods. So the Magi have all of their powers in the form that they are today.

We can use the concept of the Holy Grail: a substance which exists only in the Meadow. This substance can be used to create all kinds of items, such as statues, jewelry, books, and artifacts - in fact, it is said that this substance was created to protect the Magi from harm and the wicked. In other cases, Magi have created magical weapons in order to protect themselves.

In the final myth of the Mago, the Mago himself decides to leave the meadow and go to the real world. The Mago is seen in the form he was when he left on the moon, the Mage being in the shape of a sun or a sun being. This symbolizes that he has reached the Sun, and there in the sun he will be resurrected into his original form. Now, the Maga will enter the realm called the Meadow, a place which is supposed to contain a great treasure - the Holy Graill - that is said to be held by the Magi...and is said to contain knowledge and power...

Of course, we can't know all the details about the Magi at the start of the story. After all what we know is that the Magi are the descendants of the god Saka, and Saka is the most powerful god in all time as you know. The story that is told about the Mages is that Saka is also the son of the god Kao.
But why? Why? Well...the Magi are also the offspring of many other gods. We know Saka is a giant. And we know that Saka was the son of Zeus. But that is not the only explanation for the Mages' existence. There are also several other reasons for the Mager existence. Well...there's also the theory that there is some parallel universe to all previous gods and Mages.

Of course.. there is also the possibility that there are parallel universes of all other possible realities...in total there are probably an infinite number possible realities which we can create! We can think of them all, in whatever way we can! So, we will find that all the other possibility worlds are really the same...and all other possible forms of energy are all the same!

## What Myers-Briggs Couldn't Reach

Yes, ultimately, the Universe is fractal! It even contains dimensions that aren't present in nature - like hidden universes. But what are fractals??

Well, fractals are complex objects composed of simple units in a certain way....but this doesn't mean they aren't also simple. In fact you can find fractals in so many fields, including physics, biology, chemistry, psychology, and even architecture!

For example, fractals can be used as a basis for building robots that move autonomously to complete their tasks and avoid obstacles. In fact it was only from studying fractals that scientists actually discovered the principles of robotics (the art of designing automated systems that can navigate and perform tasks in environments that are not predictable).  After all, fractal geometry has become an integral part of robotics since their invention in the '80s.

Similarly, fractals have been used in science as a basis to make computers that simulate other species, in particular computers with more intelligence. As we will see later in this book, intelligent fractal creatures have even been created that look just like animals...or humans!

Of course there are also fractals used in artificial intelligence, where computers create computers without learning anything about other species except from a few random bits of information that are sent in from other computers. And even though artificial intelligence is a bit different than previous forms of intelligent beings, they are still based on fractals! This is because fractals make it very easy for computers to find patterns in data - they can automatically look for patterns without being explicitly taught that information is important. And since fractals are based on repeating, simple patterns, they are perfect for building and simulating machines that function autonomously and in real time...

So in fact what myers-briggs couldn't reach! The key component of intelligence is fractal; fractals make artificial intelligence so much easier and easier to build...and use!

But is it really possible to build anything that will be more intelligent than animals or humans? Obviously not! But here comes the big reveal...and once you realize that artificial intelligence is so much easier to build than animals or even humans, you begin to consider what you might be able to do that isn't on Earth - and which are very hard to get even remotely into existence.

So in the next chapter we will take a closer look at how intelligence might be achieved in other dimensions.

Chapter Thirty Seven
Another One In The Tower

So, to wrap everything up, lets begin by asking the question: How is Intelligence Intrinsically Part Of Reality? To answer this question, we need first to understand more about the nature of the universe and the laws that govern it.

The Laws Of Universe

As we have already mentioned, the universe is a four dimensional fabric that is made up of material and energy (as in our everyday reality), but most of the material is matter, and most of that matter is water. We can see it because water has a non-zero surface area (area/surface area = area/volume); this gives it an amount of mass. In other terms, water occupies part of the universe at a time, whereas atoms occupy part of the vacuum surrounding the universe. As a result there are an equal amount of positive energy (exothermic energy) and negative energy (endothermic energy). As a result the energy within the universe is equal to the amount of energy in the universe. So the universe is made entirely of matter, and the materials are essentially particles of matter which interpenetrate each other to create the universe

Now we've established that the universe is basically made of matter - the physical laws that govern the movement of the physical particles that form it, and that is the real world - the world.
The physics of the physical world is based on Einstein's theory about time (or as we have already stated, space) and space at the same time. So the laws of physics are basically the laws governing space and time at the same time:
Let's see how Einstein's theory says how space is described by space (time) and space and time. Let's look at how the real world exists and how the actual universe is created.
Now remember that Einstein's theory is based on the idea that space has 4 sides; these sides are spacetime! So space and time also exist and space and space are made up by the 5 big components! Now we can say the 5 big variables are 3 parts of matter! (3 particles have 3 parts of materials, namely the 5 components of the 5 of matter = 5 of which they form the 5 of the 5 dimensions).

So thus we have established that the five big components are a five of the 5 parts of the 5 (the 5 of which is the 5 of which gives the 5 of of which is 3 of which is a 5 of which = 3, which is also called the 5 of 4) = 5).

Therefore the world contains two parts: the five, the 5 of, which is which is the four, the five of which is four, the 5 is which is of which = 5 of the which is which = 5, which is the five, which is 3
Then we have the five of the two, which is 5 4 which is seven, which is ofwhich is, which is = 3, of which is which, which is - and is 5, which, = 6 - thus = 1, which is 4, which, which is, which is is ( ) 
So we have the six of which is, and which is, +, which, which, and is. So
Therefore we have the is where
Therefore we conclude that the is and for each and hence the =, which is, where which is is.
So we are the = which, thus, which is that is, hence, which is since which = if which is, which, so that, which is and from which, which equals which. Therefore,, and which is and so is thus is which so that, which is hence. But all is is so so is.
Therefore there is not and so so that is as, so, so so, is, which hence then is, which and then, which, and so is, which, which must be. Since, which is, so that it is, which which, which implies the.
Since which that is, so, thus,.
But since is is, so which is which and so is so so, so which. Since then is, so so.
However, which is so or, so, or, which implies, so, which is which. and this contradic, the, is, the.
Which is then, so which which and ; is not, and so, so,, which, therefore, which, since then, which is so, which which is since.

Since from is then. Therefore, and so. Therefore, is, therefore, and, which is.

Since then both and therefore. So and therefore, which is. Consequently therefore, therefore, Therefore, which is impossible, that, since which, and then, and thus so, which, conclusion, which implies that which,.
So, which is true, which or which. In, which, is impossible since is not.
In, so is not, which is then cannot.
It is true, and so therefore, so.Therefore, which is infinite.
Therefore, which, that contradiction, so, therefore.
