 This means that deities can truly be said to travel freely between dimensions, since they can move as fast as they want without experiencing any sort of physical or temporal restrictions.

A:

So, if we understand the relativity of mass, and its effects on the speed of sound, then we can apply the relativity of simultaneity to calculate the speed of sound.
Let's take a simple example of a wave traveling at 100km per second. Let's consider a simple wave front moving at 100km per second. Then when the wave front passes through a medium, it's not moving at the speed of light, but rather traveling at 100km/s (100m/s less than the speed of light) while the waves traveling before the wave front are traveling at the speed of light. That's because the medium changes the speed of the wave, making it travel slower in the middle of the medium than it would in vacuum.
So the speed of sound in the middle of a medium is equal to the speed of the wave in vacuum times the attenuation of the medium. The attenuation of the medium is equal to the square of the speed of sound times the density of the medium times the speed of sound times the attenuation of the medium times the distance between the source and the receiver. So, at the speed of sound in the middle of a medium, it's equal to the speed of the wave in vacuum times the attenuation of the medium times the density of the medium times the speed of sound times the attenuation of the medium times distance. The attenuation of the medium is equal to the square of the speed of sound times the attenuation of the medium times the density of the medium times the speed of sound times distance. So, at the speed of sound in the middle of the medium, it's equal to the speed of the wave in vacuum times the attenuation of the medium plus the square of the attenuation of the medium times the density of the medium plus the square of the speed of sound times the attenuation of the medium times the distance.
So, at the speed of sound in the middle of a medium, it's equal to the speed of a wave in vacuum plus the square of the attenuation of the medium plus the square of the speed of sound times the attenuation of the medium plus the square of the density of the medium plus the square of the speed of sound times the attenuation of the media plus the square of the distance.
