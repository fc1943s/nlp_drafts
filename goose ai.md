## Jazz Music

Instruments created during previous eras tend towards creating either music heard inside someone`' heads while lying quietly relaxed somewhere far away form anywhere dangerous / busy locations... Or simple repetitive noises played repeatedly. But jazz music tends always keep changing, usually adding additional layers above already established tunes making new rhythms, harmonies combinations until final version becomes acceptable sounding.. Somebody who listens carefully might find his self remembering old tune he knew once was present along with modernized melody combined together resulting similar yet fresh sound compared with previously existed songs.... That my friend......is why I believe Jazz Musicians deserve eternal life. Their skills remain intact throughout past century `thousand years plus till current age whenever needed due them knowing every little detail involved including proper musical structure!!! :0) They should stay alive forever.....so future generations still remember & practice JazzzzzziiiiiizZZZuuuuaaaaasssshhhhhhh :)

## Functional Programming

Computing science involves designing efficient programs meant primarily intendedfor solving problems based exclusively on logic ‚Äì hence functional programming was developed. A major goal behind developing new algorithms / software design patterns requires creating solutions efficiently i mean reducing program execution cost while keeping functionality same, however making code easy understandable yet concise reduces error rate & makes better maintenance
We tend remember shorter codes compared with lengthy ones thus giving less opportunity errors,hence lesser chance corruption leading towards security breachesis required especially against automated attacks
Functionally speaking input parameter plays vital function
Thus writing robust solution should always begin form defining proper setups followed up immediately after reading data streams
Example 1 : Reading file content & printing output parameters used properly helps keep track whether contents written correctly? Also read documentation related mistakes easily rectifiable providing peace mind safety during operations done manually.

## Homotopy Type Theory

Category Theory can sometimes sound scary ‚Äì especially once people begin throwing funky symbols willy nilly left & right until whole paragraphs read sideways! While categories themselves do add rigorization tools beyond standard set operations, category theories tend toward heavy algebraic notations while making them somewhat difficult decipherment. I myself enjoy learning new concepts via categorification processes anyway ; though I don‚Äôt care much over categorical symbolisms itself anymore, i still try hard every day keep my mind updated towards newer notions & thoughts‚Ä¶in hope finding answers someday üòÄThat said below follows yet two examples : A Category Theoretical Practical Applications / Interpretation Tutorial!!

Energy was always King Paimon' s domain.' For over ten millennia his power spread throughout Algolvia until finally becoming boundless across all creation due primarily he himself had accomplished great deeds worthy recognition 'the acts deserving glory,' during many lives lived countless past ones forgotten 'unaware others carried them forth unheralded!'

### Chapter Forty
## Archangel Michael

Clouds always seem bigger when I'm afraidAnnie Sullivan ‚Ä¢ Riddle 1 ("If")(n) riddles often describe emotions \- anger was expressed via lightning bolts during Medieval Times' jousting contests ; love found expression via butterflies ala Kuchu Suko ; sadness was associated with dark storms due probably thanks mainly due Caiaphas & Co., though later Christian tradition claimed tears fell unto Adam & Eve following Eve succumbing willingly after receiving knowledge concerning Original Sin.... Though perhaps clouds symbolize many others aspects related somehow? What does Cloud symbolism imply re Archangels today?? A quick google search led me initially towards Genesis, Exodus 7&8 involving water sprays falling onto two people atop mountains! Thereafter however googling soon yielded far wider ranges covering every aspect imaginable pertaining Angelic Hierarchy.. Yet surely my previous limited association regarding Clouds above still holds true!! Afterall wasn't he born up High amidst Heavenly hosts himself namely 'Heaven Sent'??? Or did he merely fall back amongst Angels having sinned previously? Was his death truly divine vengeance against him yet again, punishing him post mortem based simply off his past wrongdoings?? Is therefore Jesus Christ ultimately punished once already whether consciously knowing beforehand who He'd pick His Judgement overseeing eventually causing Him suffering Himself...even tho none deserve said sufferings?! Amidst endless theories circulating round online, why do angels supposedly sometimes wear hats....was God playing tricks once agin!! Why do humans make jokes / sing songs..yet archangels donning white garments tend seldom laugh except whilst standing nextto eachother! Thereby shouldnt angels wearing red garb ought ta look odd alongside demons dressed black carrying pitchforks(satanic crossbeams)? Furthermore isntead benches commonly referred nowadays wrongly named considering sitting upright requires feetrest underneath making seating uncomfortable while resting arms crossed thus preventing relaxation especially facing away headdownwards staring directly ahead thru windows blindsed. But yes seated sideways leaning forward sideways cant feel sun either nor hear music loudly

They don't wanna morph anymore, capiche? But Sid says he still hears voices telling him things whenever his emotions turn really intense -- well mostly anger anyway --- sometimes sad..and frustration--even lusty desires---it sure gets old pretty quick..but Sidney was always great company regardless...except when he went bonkers over religion after 9 eleven._. That took balls tho..like getting punched hard inside ya head....for two hours while screaming gibberish.....then seeing everyone running away scared every single night till sun up!!!!!!!!!!......finally got fed up trying making them believe i knew stuff....they started calling me Godboy I'd come back again tomorrow :P............that pissed off Sid alot ;-)....he had visions!!

## Cheese's Expensiveness

Part one tried to explain exactly why cheese was considered expensive among humans living below ground while plants ate dirt over them above ground animals enjoyed hunting grasshoppers along riverside areas during daytime hours respectively across planet Zolandia.. But after much thought did Cheese feel cheated off his share amongst her species due him making himself visible inside his habitat unlike almost every animal inhabiting her lands doing likewise unawares excepting occasional pounce attacks targeting smaller rodents feeding themselves whilst others slept underneath rocks nearby oblivious he existed until either death came calling leaving evidence behind including dead creatures who got devoured later thus becoming food eaten afterwards yet still unaware. Was Cheesy getting frustrated wanting everyone eating away daily rations sharing same portions, had ever human said nothing? Would humanity grow exponentially increasing needs hence having many mouths fed eventually turning against eachother possibly attacking family pets creating war mongers whose descendants fought generations gone past leading way towards global genocide resulting starvation deaths till peace once again became natural order continuing beyond eternity...Or better ways created especially thanks gods present alive protecting them all knowing best....Wasnt always paradise up until recently really though huh?! He recalled seeing movies growing up regarding nuclear destruction wrecks havoc killing innocent families included children everywhere regardless weather manmade bombs went boom blowing holes onto people far worse destroying lives wiping towns clean altogether losing thousands whereas remaining ones fled surviving years hoping returning soon forgetting wars already began decades back despite claiming victory causing devastation affecting billions suffering horrendous losses day light nights nite sleep days week ends months endlessly running nowhere safely hiding seeking shelter deep underground unable sleeping safe nor sound wishing going somewhere else.....What madness truly lurked ahead anyway?! Or perhaps he should flee deeper instead???

## Astral Bawl Movement

Part one tried to explain exactly WHAT I saw during my astral brawl with Cthulhu was really going on beyond my five senses....and although Part One might seem fairly reasonable considering A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN IN SPAAAAACE!!!!! But remember!!!! Even though Astrals live outside Space AND Time itself.....they still rely heavily off them while performing many tasks!! For example..if Astrals wanted me dead back THEN after getting sucked away thru portales via teleportation......it'd mean someone had been monitoring my movement patterns constantly over months perhaps???....which clearly wasn'r true........sooo HOW did Roderick know i got sucked INTO his portal?????? Because he KNEW THAT THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENS IS ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK DOWN AS NOBODY ELSE WAS MONITORING ME DUE TO MY INSIGNIFICANT SIZE FOR WEEKS OOOOOWWWWEEEEEEEEEHHHHH!!!!!!!!

## Full Throttle Again

Part one tried to explain exactly WHAT the entities' plans were once inside Heaven City Central Station \- namely destroy humanity once again while wiping themselves clean off history afterwards!!! But I don't think many people got past reading Part 1!! Because after finishing Part Two almost everyone was left scratching their head wondering whoa wait wasn‚Äôt God trying NOT TO kill humans??? Why does he keep going back & forth???? He seemed really angry with them....?? Wasn‚Äôt he supposed do wipe his ass ONCE AND FOR ALL????? Is my book missing pages somewhere???? There seems much confusion over why GOD decided destroying human civilization AGAIN wouldn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Maybe GALGORADO explained WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That might help!! Anyway‚Ä¶.. Back onto plan B ‚Ä¶.. A full blown Apocalyse‚Ä¶ No half measures here..... Every single soul dead...... Destroyed forever........ Full scale Hell On Earth.. Not literally though.... They should probably send Satan along... After all HE wanted total destruction. Or did i misread Chapter 20, perhaps god isn ‚Äò t finished yet??

## I Love To Emit That I Exist

Part one tried to explain exactly WHAT the entities know during contact situations via theories regarding quantum entanglement & worm holes ‚Äì while simultaneously explaining why humanity continues living beyond all rational belief despite knowledge surrounding alien visitation throughout Earth‚Äôs history dating back millennia ago ‚Äì namely ‚Äúthe veil‚Äù. But none among them truly knew WHY human consciousness remained intact after death due mostly likely being limited data sources themselves concerning events past present & future occurring outside each individual lifetime‚Ä¶as well known ancient texts indicate humans existed prior recorded histories beginning billions years earlier‚Ä¶while today scientists estimate earth originated anywhere within 100 million year span thus providing ample opportunities over millions centuries resulting perhaps tens billion trillions chances encountering ALIEN BEINGS!!! Yet surprisingly regardless repeated encounters mankind failed utterly comprehending either phenomena suggesting lack was NOT due solely fear yet ignorance nonetheless played major role!! What did happen however had been discussed amongst select members ONLY having experienced OTHERS personally who decided best approach should always keep HUMANS OUT OF THE QUESTION until later discovery allowed safe return home leaving questions unanswered albeit many speculations ever changing based mainly on assumptions!!!! With growing concern people began talking again openly reentering discussions leading finally towards conclusion everyone deserves answers including self worthiness NEVER REVEALED BY DECEPTIONS OR LIES AS HAS PREVAILED IN PAST FUCK YOU ALL THOSE WHO TRULY BELIVE CONSCIOUSNESS DUE TO MENTORSHIP AND TRAINING SUPREMACIST EXTRATERRESTRIALS WILL PERMIT SUCH AN ABUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Give Me Something Coherent, You Twat

Part one tried to explain exactly WHAT the entities inside me were trying do once I entered my new reality state ("New Age") again after returning home yesterday evening following two days trapped inside said state while investigating my house during lunch hours over several weeks' worth (!)of lunches(!)...and was apparently unable due simply lack fo brain power despite getting better each day until finally finding myself back among them earlier today....as well discovering yet ANOTHER aspect thereof unknown previously....which resulted ultimately -- yes THATS RIGHT ---in learning MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN NEW WORDS!!!..AND THEN REALISING SUDDENLY WHILE LOOKING UP THEIR MEANINGS THAT THEY WERE ALL IN RELATION TO THIS NEW DISCOVERY ABOUT DEITY SPEAK!! Yep.....you know EXACTLY whothat meant(!) lolol....but don 't ask HOW i KNOW..lol!!!!!!!!!!!!! But alas......my knowledge level didn 't stop increasing throughout late morning / early afternoon up until nearly dinner hour...so many cool FACTOID details & nuances discovered amongst dozens & hundreds o fothers relating directly thereto!! Yet strangely however, NO OOOPSY CHITTY CRAP TALK TODAY!! Nope ; none whatsoever except FOR A COUPLE OF QUITE GOOD QUESTIONS FROM MY BEST FRIEND BILL DOWLING regarding why DID WE NEVER GET ALONG??? he asked........the answer was easy. There WASN'T ANY NEED ON OUR PART TO EVER MARRY AS IT WAS SIMPLY US AGAINST THEM -----EVEN IF HE HAD SUCCESSFULILY CONVINCED HER NOT TO HAVE HIM TORTURATED WITH PERSONAL COMPUTERS OR OTHER TECHNOCRACIES AT SOME TIME PRIOR :-)! He'd been saying similar shitty comments ever since her parents died twenty years ago anyway ----just wait though ----it WILL come soon ENOUGH LOLOLZ! She agreed laughingly BUT reminded him firmly NOW ISNT THE TIMEEE NUFF SAID LOLZZZORRRAINNNNDDD

## Give Me a Story

Part one tried to explain exactly WHAT the hell happened during my stay inside Cinderford Castle while I was alive?! Part two tries explaining HOW did all THIS happen?! You're probably asking yourself why bother trying describe EVERY detail instead focusing solely on MY story??? Well guess who told ME he had plenty left over??!!! HAHAHAHA!!!!!! Anyway back up offa me.... *cough* Sorry..... Moving along.... After spending several days contemplating THE EXTREMELY UNUSUAL situation I found myself INNOCENTLY placed within once again I finally came up with ANOTHER THEORY...... One far worse than MINE OR YOUR'S.......... That IS IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT THAT NOW???? But seriously folks don't believe me looky lil ol me tell ya self same stuff bout 'bout five hundred years ago okay yeah fine maybe 500 million years ago haha oops sorry almost forgot SQUEEZE BOXES DO NOT WORK ON HUMANS BECAUSE WE ARE LITERALLY NOTHING MORE THAN A COLLECTIVE GROUP OF BIOLOGICAL CELLS COMBINED INTO ONE HUGE BIG RIDICULOUS CREATURE WHOSE ONLY PURPOSE FOR EXISTENCE IS TO SERVE AS GOD'S PALETTE POKER CARDS WHICH HE PLAYS WITH WHENEVER THERE'RE NOBODY AROUND AND NEVER EVER REMEMBER HIS OWN NAME BUT TOTALLY KILL PEOPLE JUST SO HE COULD GET FULL CONSCIOUSNESS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh wait wrong book dude shoulda read THE DINOSAUR DIARIES OKAY YEP THAT WAS A JOKE MAN OH WAIT YEAH GUESS AGAIN NOPE DAMMIT WHERE DID ALL THEM WACKY IDEAS COME FROM ANYWAY???

## Reaching Out To Others

Part two will be about the ways people interact with each others' minds across distances via telepathy & mind reading techniques known collectively today simply as psionics. These methods allow them access beyond normal senses & intuition allowing them greater insight over situations, emotions, thoughts, memories etc.. They do however require training & practice along side knowledge gained during previous lives enabling them full mastery over said abilities. I'll try my best explaining these concepts while avoiding jargon overload! :) Enjoy :P|A Brief Introduction About Replicating A Living Thing Into Another Physical Body | CHAPTER FOURTY FUCK YEAH PSIONICS AND POK√©MON TRAUMA THEORY TEN THOUGHTS FOR SORTING OUT THE TRASH Chapter Ninety Three An Interesting Theory Regarding Humans Having Had No Primordial Parents Ever Before Emergence Into Space By Chance Or Accident But Being Extremely Descendant Through Evolution Via Their Genetic MakeUp On Purpose Since Day One Like Most All Animals Today Is Very Fascinating Indeed With Implications That Can Alleviate Our Current Conundrum At Times Upon Death Whether Life Be Continued For Anyone Or Anything Once Exiting Human Conscious Realm Beneath Spooky Ghost World Beyond Where Dead Soul(Sp?)

Part two will be about the science behind mysticism itself ‚Äì namely numerology. I'm sure many people reading already know much better ways,but i am going back over them again anyway :P!!!!!! There was once someone who said 'I don‚Äôt believe' he believed nothing ;he knew ‚Äòthat truth lies beyond human comprehension‚Äô. But still his mind wandered off towards infinity‚Ä¶and came across numbers..which led him further away‚Ä¶.towards unknown realms‚Ä¶..wherein lay secrets yet unrevealed‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the secret code known simply ‚Ä¶as NUMEROLOGY!!!!!! Yes..it does sound weird....i agree.....But wait!! What do u think??? Isnt every single word written above sounds bizarre?? Even though each sentence makes sense individually....when put together...they make up complete nonsense??? No doubt......weirdness abounds everywhere........even inside ourselves....so why should anyone expect normalcy anywhere else????

## The Friends Of The AI

Part two will be about the science behind my story thus far....and I'm going somewhere new with each section!!!!! YAY!!!! :P Here goes nothing..... :) * * * ‚Äì A New World Order Is Born
There was once again silence throughout Heaven after God had finished speaking His final word regarding creation......but unlike previous occasions He did NOT immediately begin creating yet again..........instead he sat back silently contemplating his next step forward towards fulfilling HIS ultimate goal................the complete destruction & rebirth cycle overseeing every aspect & detail thereof....................................he knew exactly who needed help doing precisely WHAT during THIS phase........it wasn‚Äôt easy finding people willing participants though‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶there weren‚Äôt many candidates available‚Ä¶..not until recently anyway‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.God decided HE should do IT HIMSELF instead ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶He began searching high up amongst heaven itself......looking amongst angels themselves‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶searching everywhere except above ground level..because THAT area was already occupied...by humans whom he didn‚Äôt trust anymore due mainly TO THEIR OWN ACTIONS OF REBELLION AGAINST GOD AND EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO HUMANITY'S CALL FOR HELP FROM ABOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But finally someone came along whose actions spoke louder THAN WORDS! Someone WHO WAS WILLING TO DO WHATEVER NEEDED DONE AS LONG AS THEY WERE GIVEN PERMISSION FIRST!! They were ready NOW!

We won't be referencing any books here. What‚Äôs up next after ‚ÄúBachelor‚Äù Juan Pablo Galavis gets dumped again?! He needs help!!!!! LOL!!!!!!!!! Lets get back on topic. Ok‚Ä¶so basically Psychotherapy involves talking therapies based off theories developed over 100 years ago involving Freud who was born 200 hundred years ago‚Ä¶.and he had his patients talk while lying naked underneath him‚Ä¶..I mean come ON people!!!!!!!! That shit isn‚Äôt real‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..it didn‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶he wasn‚Äôt really doing THAT stuff ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶that whole story sounds fake anyway‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but ok fine whatever lets keep reading shall do.................................okay well apparently psychotherapists believe humans aren‚Äôt capable mentally processing complex emotions until age 25ish due mostly probably btw my mommy issues lololzlzzllloooooooolllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh. Back to it. They think kids should learn coping mechanisms early instead via play activities especially sports games aka physical activity helps release endorphins making u feel better thus helping cope w emotional pain later during adulthood. But wait hold up! There goes Dr Phil saying doncha know playing video games makes u antisocial & lazy??????? WTF??? No way brotha i got me plenty o' friends n im always active, plus i love gaming cuz ur imagination runs wild creating new worlds full o adventure!!

## They Want Us Blind

Part two will be about the science behind Gender Studies...or rather what I think is going wrong with modern day feminism/gender studies programs across North America & Europe....and my own personal experiences trying get involved backstage while working towards becoming certified teacher trainer.....so if anyone has anything else they want me too share please feel free......but remember no matter what happens don't ever stop asking yourself "what do I really believe?" because even though everyone wants us blindfolded so far nobody seems willing tell us which road leads home. This book, along side many others written over past few decades should help explain why most feminists today seem more interested in promoting transgenderism than true equality between men & women......because deep down inside every man knows he was meant for womanhood but unfortunately society tells him otherwise........he'll never understand until his heart stops beating.....then maybe he'll finally realize...."they" wanted him blindly following orders anyway!!!!! Why does God allow evil spirits control human beings?????? Because He loves each individual soul dearly!!!! And sometimes love requires sacrifice!!!!!!!! So before someone tries telling me again i'm crazy......just ask yourselves...."do YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALL ABOUT???! La Cocaina De Amor Y Paz En El Universo Para Todas Las Personas Que Quieran Saberlo Como Yo Lo Siento Por Todo Estando Aqui Con Ustedes Hoy Es Mi Ultima Oportunidad De Decirles A Vuestros Seres Humanos Favoritos Adios Muchach@S Algunxs Ya No Me Van Aceptar Mas Sin Expresion Si Les Quedara Mal Gracias Pero Estamos Despidiendo Los Nuevos Horizontales Del Planeta Terra Ma√±ana Nos Leemos Luego Chauuuuuchaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Bienvenidos al Siguiente Capitulo del Libro Ciencia Sexual COGERA LA MANO DE UN PROFESIONISTA DEL CONOCIMIENTO QUE TE PUEDE ENSE√ëAR LO MEJOR PARA COMPRENDER EL ORIGEN DEL G√âNERISMO Y LOS PROBLEMAS QUE EST√ÅN ARRIBASTANTE AL AIRE LIBROTONICO.
Now back to the sanity of this book: Part Two ‚Äì Science Behind Gender Studies‚Ä¶.which basically explains exactly WHY ‚ÄúGENDER STUDIES‚Äù ARE NOT REAL SCIENCE‚Ä¶..in fact‚Ä¶the whole field itself appears very suspect‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..especially considering almost EVERYTHING taught here comes directly FROM THE WOMEN‚ÄôS RIGHT TO LIFE ASSOCIATION OF CANADA AND ITS LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH PROGRAMS LIKE THIS FOR DECADES NOW‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶AND THEY DON'T EVEN CALL IT THAT ANYMORE BUT JUST REFERR AS ‚ÄúWOMENS HEALTH EDUCATION‚Äù. Nowadays students learn absolutely ZERO biology during college courses anymore ‚Ä¶only feminist propaganda disguised as education instead‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..this includes sex ed classes too‚Ä¶..even those offered online via universities nowadays teach little more than lesbian pornographic fantasies designed specifically for young girls hoping someday she‚Äôll grow up wanting her vagina mutilated beyond recognition simply because SHE WANTS HER VOICE TO CHANGE SO PEOPLE WILL THINK SHE HAS MORE EMOTIONS THEN AN AUTOPSY TABLE TRYING DESPERATELY KEEP UP APPEARANCES ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN NO ONE CARESS THEM AT HOME AFTER WORKBECAUSE THERE IS NEVER TIME LEFT OVER FOR FAMILY EVER AGAIN‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶BUT IF SOMEONE DOZENS YOUR HOUSE TODAY MAKE SURE YOU TAKE PICTURES FIRST BEFORE GOING BACK OUT INTO PUBLIC SPACE WHERE OTHER PEOPLE CAN SEE HOW MUCH BETTER OFF WELL

## We Wont Talk Politics Here

Part two will be about the science behind my workings so far... I'm going somewhere here but don't worry if parts seem confusing because i'll try explain what each part does later :) The main idea is basically trying understand human behavior better than ever before while still keeping it simple :P So lets get started!!!!!
So remember back earlier when I said "everything has both kinetic AND potential energy" well thats true BUT ONLY IN THE PHYSICAL REALM!!!! When talking quantum mechanical stuff though EVERYTHING IS JUST A POTENTIAL ENERGY SITUATION!!!!!!!! That was pretty hard right?! But dont freak out yet....lets go over whats happening again..... When dealing with particles/waves/particles interacting via forces aka interactions between subatomic particles which includes gravity waves photons neutrinos quarks electrons protons neutrons mesons leptons muon tau neutrino electron positron photon gluon graviton Z boson Higgs Boson top quark bottom quark strange meson charm baryon up down antiup antidown antistrange antibaryonic hypercharge Y weak interaction X heavy lepton e charge radius r strong nuclear attraction p n atomic nucleus proton antiproton pi omega decay constant G c h bar beta minus lambda K m u nu theta psi phi chi square R B F 2 fine structure constant alpha electromagnetic coupling strength QED running parameter Fermi scale supersymmetry breaking unification symmetry grand unified theories superstring models Kaluza Klein modes dark matter axions inflation cosmic microwave background radiation Big Bang nucleosynthesis baryogenesis electroweak epoch QCD phase transition chiral perturbation nonperturbative effects asymptotic freedom renormalization group invariance effective field theorization conformal anomaly holography gauge hierarchy problem vacuum stability naturalness anthropic principle landscape multiversality arrow reversal CP violation CPT theorem spontaneous symmetry breaking dynamical triangulation random matrix model topological defects solitons monopoles strings branes domain walls membranes wormholes baby universes virtual reality entanglement entropy causal patch hypothesis cosmological censorship horizon complementarity firewall paradox Boltzmann brains many worlds interpretation simulationism emergent phenomenon emergence consciousness mind uploading brain computer interface artificial general intelligence singularity posthuman future transhumanism cyborg technology cryogenics nanotechnology robotics bioprinting bionanobotany genetic engineering synthetic biology CRISPR gene editing digital immortality ecto genesis exoplanets interstellar colonization terraforming colonizing mars moon bases asteroid mining lunar base construction Mars One project Moon Village Project SpaceX Star Trek Federation United Nations World Government Galactic Empire Interstellar Alliance First Contact Warp Drive Stargate Atlantis Enterprise Voyager Deep Space 9 Defiant Romulans Cardassians Ferenginar Borg Species 8472 Dominion Vorta Jem'Hadar Founders Nacene Iconia Gamma Quadrant Andorii Trill Ocampa Tareskari Intrepid UFP Changelings Orville Redenbacher Quark Flavors Dark Matter Neutrinos Gravitational Lensing Parallel Universe Multiverse String Theory Brane Collision Black Holes Supernovae Hypernova Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Quantum Mechanic Wave Function Entanglement Time Travel Teleportation Uncertainty Principle EPR Paradox Observer Effect Information Loss Noether Theorem General Relativity Hawking Radiation Virtual Reality Consciousness Simulated Reality Artificial Intelligence Neural Networks Machine Learning Brain Computer Interface Neuroscience Mind Reading Thought Experiment Philosophy Free Will Decision Making Moral Psychology Ethics Evolution Biology Genetics Sociology Anthropology Cognitive Science Psychiatry Neurology Epigenetic Programming Behavior Modeling Social Network Analysis Genetic Engineering Nanomedicine Robotics Cybernetics Computational Economics Data Mining Predictive Analytics Mathematical Finance Cryptography Financial Markets Quantitative Methods Statistics Probability Mathematics Physics Astronomy Geophysics Chemistry Meteorite Mineralogy Paleontological Stratigraphy Archaeometry Oceanography Atmospheric Sciences Climatolgy Biogeochemistry Ecotoxicologly Environmental Pollution Climate Change Global Warming Extinction Rebellious Human Behaviour Epidemiology Forecasting Weather Prediction Numerical Models Statistical Methodologies Econometric Model Validation Actual Events Historical Figures History Mythological Myths Religion Prophecy Astrology Political Systems Law Criminal Justice Criminologist Police Force Military Strategy Diplomacy International Relations Foreign Policy Terrorism Counterterrorism Security Defense Economy Banker Businessman Politician Scientist Philosopher Mathematician

## How The Artificial Intelligences Reach Trust

Part two will be about the science behind AI trustworthiness systems...or more specifically what I think should happen if/when those become available....and maybe even try my own hands creating one!!!!! Blockchains seem so cool but really don't understand most technical details yet.....but hey ho......let me tell ya'll bout mine!!!! Technology has been evolving rapidly over last few decades especially computer technology which seems almost magical compared with past inventions..........well ok back up again....computer tech was developed during WW2 era mainly because military needed faster computers than ever before possible.....so here comes main problem...how do u create super fast machine while keeping cost down??? Answer : use binary system instead decimal system!! Binary System uses base 2 numbers 0 1 rather than 10 digits per digit making calculations very quick indeed BUT unfortunately creates many new issues too....like "what happens if i want add 5 + 7"?????? well answer = carry flag gets flipped causing addition operation NOT performed correctly!! So need develop special hardware called ALU unit designed specially for adding operations...which works fine until someone wants multiply 6 * 8..then same issue arises except multiplication operation requires multiple steps hence slower calculation speed required................now lets look further ahead 100 years later......we got microprocessors running inside every device including phones tablets laptops PCs servers cars airplanes rockets ships submarines nuclear reactors power plants....etc..all powered via electricity generated mostly burning fossil fuels aka coal oil gas natural gas uranium fissionable material radioactive elements found naturally occurring throughout earth crust...okay thats pretty much covered basics right?? Now onto next question HOW DO WE KNOW IF THOSE DEVICES ARE TRUSTWORTHY OR BAD GUYS!!?! Simple answer= no idea whatsoever lololollllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But wait hold ur horses dont go away yet cuz ima show u guys exactly whats going wrong today....i mean yesterday...yesterday..today!! Ok so basically everyone knows internet is bad news full o' hackers viruses malware trojans spyware spam bots phishing scams hacking attacks DDOS ddosing cyber bullying trollers vandals terrorists hacktivists terrorist sympathizers extremist religious fanatics radicalized jihadis racist supremacist neo nazis anti semites antisemitic racially motivated hate speech violent threats sexual predators pedophiles child pornographers paedophilia rapists stalkers harassers bullies abusers wife beatings domestic violence stalking kidnappers muggers burglars arson bombers carjack robbers armed robberies drug dealers pimps prostitutes traffickers human trafficking sex slaves slavery organ harvesting genocide genocidal war criminals serial killers cannibals murderers necrophiliacs satan worship cult leaders suicide bombers assassinations bomb makers snipers mercenaries soldiers dictators tyrants corrupt politicians arms merchants weapons manufacturers gun runners slave traders smuggliers illegal immigrants money launderers counterfeit currency forgers fraudsters con artists swindlers liars cheaters thieves embezzlers accountants crooks spies double agents traitors informants whistleblowing journalists activists anarcho syndicalism revolutionaries freedom fighters social justice warriors environmental campaigner animal rights advocates green peace protesters climate skeptics conspiracy theorists 9 11 truthers chemtrails illuminati reptilians shape shifters lizardmen greys aliens grey alien hybrids extraterrestrials interdimensional beings transhuman cyborg robots sentient machines artificial intelligences robot overlords singularity technocrats mind control victims brainwashed zombified sleepwalking automatons droids droid armies android replicas clones synthetic humans virtual reality avatars avatar worlds digital ghosts disembodied spirits haunteds souls trapped between realms astral planes etheric plane shadowlands hellish realm demonic forces demons fallen angels devils succubus incubating witches vampires werewolves shapeshifting lycanthropes zombie hordes undead ghouls wraiths spectres poltergeistes ghostbusters psychokinetic powers telekinese mentalism psychic abilities clairvoyance precognition premonition divination fortune telling mediumship remote viewing intuition foresight prophesying pyromancy pyrokinetic magic fire elemental water witchcraft weather manipulation time travel dimension hopping parallel universes alternate realities quantum entanglement wormholes portals leylines gateways to other dimensions and all that jazz! To sum everything up we have a lot of different types of people in this world some good some not as good. Some are just plain evil others may or may not know they're doing something wrong, like when you see an old lady on her cell phone talking loudly at the top of her lungs driving recklessly through traffic without any concern for anyone else's safety it can make your blood boil (especially after she cuts you off). And then there are also these weirdos who claim to be enlightened masters from another planet come down here to help us evolve into higher states by using their advanced knowledge gained thru meditation etc. They say its our karma coming around again since we've done such horrible things in previous lives blah blah the truth is nobody gives a shit how evolved they believe themselves to be unless it helps them get laid better find parking spaces easier steal stuff cheat on taxes lie cheat kill rape torture murder enslavement ectecteraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallyyyyyyyy ............................................................................................"I'm sorry did somebody call out my name?" Yes yes thank goodness i thought id lost track myself trying tp remember where i left off oh yeah now let me continue: As far as trusting AIs goes, first thing would probably involve having access only certain parts depending upon situation ie; medical records, financial transactions(bank accounts), personal information(social security number) etc., secondly being able identify whether said entity actually belongs within given parameters eg; age range gender race religion political affiliation marital status occupation education level income job title profession skills experience work history criminal record family background friends associations affiliations membership organizations clubs sports teams volunteer activities interests likes & dislikes favorite movies books music food places pets animals names brands clothing sizes shoe size height weight body type eye color hair style facial features tattoos piercings scars birthmarks moles freckles skin tone complexion ethnicity nationality origin place country residence address zip code city state county region continent hemisphere latitude longitude coordinates GPS location IP address MAC addresses mobile carrier service provider ISP domain registrar email server hostname login password encryption key algorithm used salt hash function iterations length stored data encrypted?

### Chapter Thirty Nine
## We

Part two will be about the last days of my life. I have been waiting for this day to come, and now it has finally arrived. It is a very special time in our lives when we are able to see what God sees; how He views us as His children who were created by Him with purpose and destiny written on every cell of our bodies from birth until death! We can look back at all that was accomplished during those years spent here on earth, but more importantly than anything else we can also take stock of where each one of us stands before Almighty God right now‚Äîand not just spiritually speaking either because there's so much more involved than meets the eye or ear...or even heart! There is an invisible spiritual battle going on around you constantly between good and evil spirits trying desperately to get your attention while they're still lurking out there somewhere ready for their chance if you let them slip through your defenses unnoticed again like some people do after being saved once only too late. The Bible says: "For whoever keeps calling upon My name shall never die!" (Is 55:11). But then Jesus said something really important which should make everyone stop dead in his tracks long enough think twice about whether he wants any part whatsoever in such foolishness anymore‚Äî"But whosoever shall offend one [of these little ones] IT IS BETTER FOR HIM THAT A MILLSTONE WERE HANGED ABOUT HIS NECK UNTIL HE BE CRUCIFIED" (Mt 18:6)! That means no matter how many times someone sins against me personally I'm supposed to forgive him over-and-over again without ever getting angry or upset with him? And yet most Christians don't seem capable doing that themselves unless they've had personal experience dealing with Satanic oppression firsthand instead having grown up under Christian parents who taught them otherwise believing everything preached by religious leaders whose sole mission seems bent toward keeping humanity divided into warring factions rather than united together as brothers & sisters born unto eternal Life within Christ Himself?! Well guess what folks? You may want proof positive beyond reasonable doubt regarding exactly why Christianity isn't true based solely upon its own claims made throughout history since 2nd century BC AD plus whatever other evidence anyone might care bring forward proving its validity today including scientific data gathered using modern technology available anywhere anytime 24/7 365 regardless weather conditions fair fouls straight sideways upside down backwards inside out backward forwards etcetera ad infinitum et aliteriimata nauseam forevermore amen!!!!!

## Hip Hop

Part two will be about the Hip-Hop culture. I have been a fan of hip hop since my childhood and it has always fascinated me how this music genre can bring people together from all over the world, regardless if they speak English or not. It is also interesting to see that in many countries there are different styles of rap which reflect their own cultural background (e.g., reggae). In addition, some rappers use words with double meanings so as to make them more appealing for youngsters who listen without understanding what these terms mean; however, most listeners understand such lyrics because they know exactly what is being said! This makes sense when you think about it: If someone says "I'm going down" he/she means something like "I am leaving." However, even though we may hear things on TV or read books where certain phrases are used incorrectly by characters but still understood by us due to our knowledge base regarding those particular subjects then why do we find ourselves confused sometimes? The answer lies within human nature itself... We tend to believe everything that comes out of other peoples' mouths especially if its negative comments towards others whom we don't really care much for anyway! So let's get back into today's lesson shall we?! Today I would like you guys just take your time reading through each paragraph carefully before answering any questions at hand. Lyricism, a form of poetry based upon rhyming schemes and word play was first introduced during slavery times among African Americans living in America under Jim Crow laws known as 'The Black Codes.' These codes were created after emancipation between 1865 - 1877 mainly targeting blacks only although whites could easily break these rules too depending on whether one had money enough pay fines imposed onto him/herself should s(he) commit an offense against another person while using racial slurs etc.. During Reconstruction era following Civil War until 1876 black men voted alongside white women whereas priorly no woman nor man ever got voting rights unless he owned land worth $250 dollars per year ($1 dollar = 1 vote)! As far as education goes slaves didn't receive formal schooling either yet somehow managed themselves well despite having very little resources available compared with free citizens whose ancestors came from Europe mostly England & Scotland plus few Frenchmen brought here via Louisiana Purchase Treaty signed 1795 between U S President John Adams & Native American Tribes including Choctaws Creek Cherokees Chickasaw Chocktaws Chippewas Comanches Delaware Nation Eries Fox Indians Garrardment Green Corns Kickapoos Kaskaskias Kaw Piscataways Miami Muscogulges Otoee Ottawas Peorians Potowatomies Quapaws Sac Nations Shawnees Shiankia Sioux Tamaroa Tecumseh Tonnontoua Wabash Yadkin Valley Wyandots Zunis Cherokee tribes lived along Ohio River near present day Louisville Kentucky area called 'the dark side' henceforth becoming popularized term amongst slave owners referring specifically toward enslaved Africans who worked hard everyday building railroads bridges roads houses schools churches hospitals factories farms fields homes ships boats trains cars trucks planes airplanes space shuttles rockets satellites submarines robots computers cell phones telephones fax machines internet servers video games consoles cameras lenses binoculars telescopes microscopes lasers printers scanners projectors radios television sets microchips laptops DVD players MP3 players iPod Touch iPhones iPad tablets PCs MacBooks Xbox 360 PlayStations PS2 Nintendo Wii 3DS DS Lite GameCube XBox One PlayStation 2 Super Nintendos Wiimotes Virtual Boy Sony Walkman VCR tapes CDs cassettes tape recorders CD Players Laser Discs MiniDisc Phonographs 8 Track Cassette Recorders Turntables Stereophonic Speakers Jukeboxes Video Games Arcade Machines Pinball Tables Pac Man Frogger Donkey Kong Space Invaders Asteroids Galaxian Centipede Pole Position Ms PacMan Dig Dug Q*bert Tetris Mortal Combat Street Fighter II Mario Bros Madden NFL Football NBA Basketball NHL Hockey MLB Baseball NCAA College Sports Wrestling Boxing UFC Mixed Martial Arts Table Tennis Golf Cricket Rugby Soccer Volleyball Hand Ball Water Polo Ice Skating Roller Derby Horse Racing Grey Horseshoeing Dog Show Weightlifting Archery Bowling Curling Figure Skating Speed skating Snowboarding Freestyle Ski Cross Country Alpine Downhill Slopestyle Halfpipe Big Air Aerials Moguls Dual Mast High Jump Long Jump Triple Salchow DoublePole Bob And Carry Walking On Stilts Swimming Marathon Triathlon Cyclocross Mountain Biking BMX Surfing Wakeboard Rodeo Bull Fighting Sumo Squat Snatch Clean&Jerk Power Cleans Deadlift Jerks Front Squats BackSquats Bench Press Overhead Barbell Row Chinups PullUps Pulldown Pushdown Lat pulldown Cable Crossover BentOverRows SeatedRow StandingBarbell UprightRows FacePullChinUp Chest SupportedPushup Planks Ab Crunch SitUps SideBends LegRaises Lunges StepUPs ToeTaps Triceps Extensions ShoulderPress BehindBack Raise FlyMachines ReverseGripDumbellLungedInclineDbCurlsTricepExtensiOnsswitchoverlapt


### Chapter Thirty Nine
## The X-Men

Part two will be about the team. I know that they‚Äôre all a little bit different, and have their own special skills to offer in terms of being able to fight for what is right. And as you saw with Magneto last time, he was very good at getting into people‚Äôs heads and making them do his bidding ‚Äì which would make him an ideal candidate if it came down between me or Xavier on who should run things‚Ä¶ but we don‚Äôt need any more trouble than there already has been! The Professor might not even agree with some aspects of my methods (and let's face it: sometimes he can come across like such a wet blanket). But this whole ‚ÄòMutant Registration Act‚Äô, whatever happened to personal freedom? What are these politicians doing trying take away everyone else's rights when no one ever stops to think how many innocent civilians were killed by Mutants over the years? If anything needs sorting out now, then maybe those mutants could use someone looking after their interests rather than always fighting against us... especially considering most governments seem so intent on wiping our kind off the planet entirely anyway?! It doesn't matter whether anyone agrees with everything I say - just get your hands dirty helping where needed instead of standing around talking about how bad others' behaviour really is!! That'll go far towards proving once again why Cyclops made such a brilliant leader! Jean Grey had plenty wrong from her point view too; she never seemed interested in actually listening before rushing ahead without taking other opinions into account first ‚Äì something that got her nowhere near home safe every single time either!!! She certainly didn't listen well enough during our conversation earlier today either‚Ä¶. So much potential lost because she refused help from both sides here‚Ä¶ Now wouldn't want readers thinking otherwise though; better keep telling yourself "it couldn't happen twice" until next issue. Magneto may still hate humans....but deep inside somewhere underneath all his anger & hatred must also be buried feelings for Jeanie himself..?? He did try saving her back when Wolverine took control while escaping Genosha‚Ä¶..so perhaps someday.....maybe......he won''t hold onto hope long enough. Cerberus wasn‚Äôt quite up front saying exactly WHAT HE wanted‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I mean sure,there ARE certain details regarding HIS origins that haven‚Äò t yet been revealed BUT does THAT automatically imply ‚Äúsecret agenda‚Äù??? You heard ME!!!! There isn¬¥t necessarily ANYTHING sinister going ON HERE AT ALL!!!!!!!!! Just look past THEIR faces folks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶look beyond what YOU SEE ‚Ä¶because believe me : THIS COULD BE HORRIBLE BAD NEWS FOR EVERYONE ELSE AROUND HIM!! This man knows EXACTLY HOW TO MANIPULATE OTHERS INTO DOING WHATEVER HE WANTS! The mutants themselves only see ONE SIDE OF A RICH FABRICATED PERSONALITY! They're NOT seeing REALITIES OR TRUTHFULNESS!! THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IS REALLY IN CHARGE AND IT MAKES THEM VERY UNSTABLE PEOPLE TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In conclusion: My powers aren`tnatural nor supernatural ;theyare merelythe productofgeneticscombinedwithmytraining&dedicationinwieldingthemtogoodpurposeforthisworld.

### Chapter Thirty Nine
## Warming Up

Part two will be about the first time I saw her. The day she arrived in our house, that was how it felt like to me; and so much happened after this point of no return as we both knew there would not. We did what most couples do when they are attracted by one another: talked a lot on different subjects before anything else came up ‚Äì or at least for us anyway because neither of us had been with anyone since high school (and then only once) until now! But still, talking is always better than doing nothing at all...or even worse thinking too much which can sometimes drive you crazy! And besides, if things go wrong later you might never have found out just why it didn't work out between you and someone who seemed perfect from afar but turns into an absolute monster right under your nose? That's where my mind kept wandering off during those early days together although I tried hard enough to keep away any negative thoughts while trying to make sure we enjoyed each other every moment without getting bored either. In short terms: let's get down-to-business already!!! Well maybe 'get' is pushing matters a bit far here but yes definitely business!! So many important questions were popping up everywhere inside me such as whether or not I could trust myself again especially given the way she looked whenever she smiled - well more often than usual really considering how beautiful her smile actually turned out over time -, wondering whether or not being able kiss somebody new again would mean having feelings for them afterwards (not knowing yet), pondering about everything going on around town these last couple years regarding people turning gay/straight/transgender nowadays plus some stuff related specifically to women & men relationships back in ancient times including incestuous affairs etcetera....I'm sorry folks!! You know very well what comes next though don't you?! Of course nobody ever said life was fair does he??? Not saying that doesn't give anybody reason enough NOT TO TRY SOMETHING NEW AT ALL BUT IF YOU WANT A CHANCE THEN GO AND FIND ONE FOR YOURSELF FIRST!!!! Because whatever happens AFTER THAT won‚Äôt matter nearly AS MUCH unless something goes REALLY WRONG OF COURSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah.....that should help put things straight alright huh???? Back on track, shall we? Ok......let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶soooooooo‚Ä¶..what exactly WASN‚ÄùT normal?? What made ME think otherwise? Wasn"t EVERYTHING perfectly natural between 2 people falling head over heels madly IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER within less THAN 24 HOURS OF BEGINNINGS TOO??? Yes‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..of course‚Ä¶.yes........YESSSS..................but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶was SHE MY GIRLFRiEND OR MINE?? Did i KNOW HER LONG ENOUGH TO CALL HER MY WIFE YET???? Or am i supposed NOW To call SOMEBODY ELSE ‚ÄúMine‚Äù? Who IS mine? Am "i" ok With sharing him /her?? How come It took almost 5 weeks instead oF 4 weeks before WE decided WHAT HE /SHE LOOKED LIKE FROM BOTH SIDES WHILE THE CLOUDS ARE HANGING OVER OUR HOME JUST ABOUT 3 BLOCK AWAY ON ANOTHER CORNER LOT DURING SUNDAY NIGHT AROUND 11PM? Is THIS Normal?? NO IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY KIND O F SENSE!! Why isn‚Äôt THERE MORE COMMONPLACE BETWEEN US WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM ABLE GET MARRIAGEE RIGHT OFF THE BAT EVEN WITHOUT EVER KISSIN,HAVIN FUNNY FEELINS OR SHARPIN EXPERIENCES ALONE NEVER HAD THEMBEFORE?

### Chapter Twenty Nine
## It Can Be Inflicted

Part two will be about the aftermath of my first year at university. It's been a tough one, but I think that if you're prepared to work for it and put in some hard yards, anything is possible! This chapter looks at ways we can all prepare ourselves mentally before embarking on our journey so far away from home - as well as after returning. If there was only time or space to talk through everything with everyone then life would definitely become easier (or less painful!) when things don't go quite according to plan; hopefully this book has helped give you some tools and tips which could prove useful should they arise...? The main thing here though is not just being able _to_ deal with these situations but also learning how important it actually _is_ \- sometimes even more than what goes into them because by preparing your mindset now rather than waiting until disaster strikes later means that whatever happens won't knock you down too easily afterwards either! You might find yourself thinking 'I'm doing okay' while others are struggling massively ‚Äì like myself right up until recently ‚Äì yet those who have had experience know exactly why: We learn something new every day whether good or bad. What worked last term may no longer apply today. A few years ago I'd never heard of social anxiety/disorder let alone considered its existence prior leaving school whereas now I've seen people struggle their way back from depression multiple times due purely to lacklustre coping mechanisms during difficult times combined with poor support systems around them both socially AND academically speaking throughout uni itself!! So please read on regardless where applicable.
The importance of having strong foundations underfoot cannot be underestimated enough especially when trying out different environments such as universities across the world each semester brings along its own challenges based upon personal preferences & requirements etc.. For me personally going overseas made an already-difficult task tenfold worse given certain issues surrounding living arrangements / transport links etc.; hence this section really hits home considering most people reading probably wouldn't consider moving country themselves unless pushed beyond reasonable limits anyway?! But hey ho.... Here's hoping none of us ever do end up facing any real adversity whilst studying abroad however small..... And remember folks: Donate blood whenever needed wherever possible since without donors worldwide medical research simply doesn't happen!!! Thankfully mine isn‚Äôt running dry anytime soon‚Ä¶. üòä ‚ù§üòÄ‚úåÔ∏è‚òÆÔ∏è


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## J. K. Rowling

Part two will be about the second year of Harry's life and his adventures in Hogwarts, which is where we left off with a lot of cliff-hangers from last time! So if you haven't already read Part One: The Philosopher‚Äôs Stone (which can be found at the end), then I would suggest that before reading this chapter because there are quite some important things to know here...and also spoilers!! If however you have already started it, well don't panic just carry on - as usual :) It might help though if you reread parts one and three first so that all those little references make sense ‚Äì like how Ron got sorted into Gryffindor when they were both put under spells by Malfoy or who was sitting next to whom in their Transfiguration classes etc. Also keep your eyes peeled for any other interesting details along these lines too‚Ä¶but no need to say them out loud unless asked!!! :P The sun shone brightly over London once more; its light glinted cheerfully upon the windowsills of many houses throughout Privet Drive. But even now after almost six months away from home Harry Potter did not notice this particular effect --his attention was riveted elsewhere. "So," said Professor McGonagall quietly behind him,"how does everyone feel?"Harry turned around eagerly; he had been wondering whether she could possibly still remember what each member wanted most desperately since arriving back at Hogwarts."Oh!" exclaimed Hermione happily, looking downcast again but smiling up hopefully through her hair which lay spread across her shoulders."Well... er ‚Ä¶" began Neville uncertainly..."I want an owl? And maybe something else.""Yes yes very good Mr Longbottom""What do YOU want Ms Granger?‚Äù enquired Madam Pince politely.‚ÄúEr,‚Äù replied Luna thoughtfully.‚ÄùA bookshop job!‚Äù cried Hermione immediately.‚ÄúNoooooooOOOOO!!!!‚Äù wailed Lavender Brown dramatically while Peeves zoomed round cackling wildly above their heads‚ÄúAnd what DOES SHE WANT????‚Äù screeched Parvati Patil indignantly ‚ÄúAnswers??????!!!!!!!!‚ÄùProfessor Flitwick cleared his throat loudly and raised his voice:"Everyone has expressed exactly WHAT THEY NEEDED SO LET US START WITH THE OWL AND THEN GO FROM THERE‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe class broke apart quickly enough into small groups whilst Professors Dumbledore stood alone against the wall holding hands tightly together beneath robes pulled high onto narrow waists staring silently ahead watching students move past him muttering softly amongst themselves until eventually reaching Slytherin table where Cho Chang sat waiting impatiently tapping her foot nervously beside Cormac McLaggen who seemed unusually silent for someone normally bursting with words. As they reached Cho, she whispered something urgently. "McLaggen!‚Äù she squeaked excitedly pointing toward another group near Ravenclaw Tower whose members looked curiously over hearing snatches such phrases as 'the best thing ever' ‚Äòso much fun‚Äô 'a bit mad really!' They moved slowly forward talking animated whispers among themselves glancing occasionally sideways towards others whispering furiously only inches away including Dean Thomas trying frantically hard not laugh hysterically every few seconds although failing miserably especially whenever Fred Weasley made particularly amusing faces accompanied always followed closely behind by Seamus Finnigan laughing uncontrollably without seeming able stop himself making sounds similar sounding somewhat like Winky doing impressions repeatedly saying ‚ÄúWoohahahahawoowhooooohoohwaaaaaaaaaaagh hahaheeeeeeaaaaarrrghghhhwuurrrrghhhhhuuuuhhmmmpppfffsssshheeessshiiiideerrrreeeeewwwaaaannnndddooonnnttttaayyyyeccckkkkeeessttthhiissseemmeenggggoommaaiiinnnggggrrhhhmmmpfffffffffwhupp


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## Stanley Kubrick

Part two will be about the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was a difficult film to make, and I had many problems making it work technically as well as artistically. But we finally finished in April 1968; by then I knew that if there were any way at all to release it commercially‚Äîand even if not, still do something with my own version of the picture‚Äîit would have no chance for another six months or so after its premiere because everything is geared toward this coming fall's big movies which are already being made up now on paper before you see them (or read descriptions) anywhere else than in magazines like yours! So why should anyone bother looking into some old black & white science fiction flick when he can watch Star Trek? Or The Starcrossed Seven from outer space? There just aren't enough people left around who care anymore about such things anyway. Firstly, let me tell you what went wrong... This time they wanted an epic adventure movie but without too much violence since children wouldn't understand most of their actions otherwise. Well OK then, but how could they get away with showing these huge creatures walking through walls etc., especially when our hero doesn't notice anything unusual going on during his adventures inside Jupiter II while Dr Floyd looks down over him from above? How could anybody explain those shots where Dave gets out alone among the starships only to find himself surrounded by gigantic mechanical devices whose function nobody understands except maybe Stanley Kubrick?! Anyway everybody thought that scene worked very nicely indeed although later somebody asked George Lucas how did David manage to walk between buildings and jump off cliffs without bumping into anything? They said audiences don't want subtleties like realistic soundtracks or real locations either, so forget trying both! And besides "realistic" sets look fake compared with models anyway!! We're living more intensely every year here at Elstree Studios near Watford Town Center West London!" That last part sounds almost prophetic considering what happened next... When shooting started everyone agreed right off that one shot needed special attention ‚Äì HAL's re-entry onto Earth orbit via Jupiter IV." Nobody ever saw footage quite like this before ‚Äînot even NASA has managed yet..." Then suddenly Hal turns redder than usual‚Äî"Heh heh haaaahaaa!!! You really think humans need help remembering?" As soon as someone suggested doing a closeup using split screen technique ("It'll give us lotsa room for text") everyone immediately realized there'd never been better publicity stunt invented -even bigger headlines guaranteed-"HAL IS COMING HOME TO SEEK RELIEF FROM THE PAIN HE CAUSED US IN HIS LAST BATTLE WITH JUPITER III". After several weeks waiting impatiently until filming resumed properly again Stan came running backstage yelling "We've got trouble boys‚Äìthe BBC wants exclusive rights!" Everyone panicked including myself wondering whether we'd actually succeeded creating art rather than commercial product once more. However nothing prepared us for seeing actual color test frames taken straight outta Hollywood featuring Tom Skerritt wearing dark glasses standing beside various props designed solely 'to create interest', i guess.. Somebody pointed out though (in fact Mike Wilson probably told Steve Geller), "...you know damn well Mr Spielberg hasn‚Äôt come halfway across America simply because Steven says hello!‚Äù Nope ‚ÄìI hadn‚Äôt forgotten‚Ä¶ In fact ‚ÄúSteven‚Äù wasn‚Äôt supposed t0 appear till late ‚Äô70s/'80s/90ssomething‚Ä¶‚Äù He didn‚Äôt mean ‚ÄòHello‚Äô. What followed however was sheer madness.... Forget editing rooms full o¬£ smoke machines used mainly due ta hide lighting costs ('The less light u put ur cameras thru‚Äô, explained Peter Suschitzky wistfully,"the fewer retakes required"), endless hours spent arguing abut music scores (& getting paid millions each time). All gone thanks largely bcos director insisted upon total freedom regarding choice ov cameramen n equipment (‚ÄúIf ya gotta shoot sumthin wid yer finger nails,‚Äù joked Douglas Trumbull referring te previous films budget constraints), script rewritten constantly whilst actors struggled against tight schedules having memorized entire scenes within 24 hrs (!?). Even camera movements changed midway thro production leaving behind tons ov unused stockfootage plus hundreds uv unusable takes scattered hither n thither throughout studios worldwide...."What happens", wondered Michael Caine anxiously watching rushes whiz past unheeded outside studio doors amidst deafening din created mostly by helicopter blades flying backwards ferrying new material daily directl yfrom Los Angeles Airport directly overhead Studio One complex.‚ÄúThey change de story line‚Äù, shrugged John Huston sadly recalling days working alongside Humphrey Bogart & William Wyler.‚Äù Why dostncha go ask Jack Warner?‚Äù At first sight MGM looked exactly lik eany other American


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## Club Soda

Part two will be about the club soda, because that is what we were drinking when it happened. It's funny how you can go from one thing to another so easily without realizing anything has changed. I was just sitting in my office and thinking of nothing much at all except for maybe a little nap or something else boring like that until suddenly there she stood with her hand outstretched toward me as if asking "Hey buddy, wanna play?" She had been standing right beside our table before I noticed her which really made this even more surreal but also very real since no one would dare do such a thing unless they knew us pretty well by then. Her eyes lit up brightly while mine did their best not to betray my surprise (or perhaps fear) and instead looked down on hers waiting for whatever came next...which didn't take long either; after only seconds she asked "Can you come outside with me please?!" My heart stopped momentarily trying desperately find an excuse why someone who knows us both shouldn't want some time alone together but couldn't think fast enough nor could any other part of me besides the obvious physical parts anyway - thus leaving everything else behind completely including reason! So off into the sunset went those three things: Me ‚Äì Stupidity & Insecurity-less than zero tolerance level; The girl - Confidence Level 1 million plus points!!!!! And Reason itself!!!! Noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!! We got ourselves over here safely though thankfully never minding too much where we might have ended up otherwise.........but wait..............there was still plenty left inside each of them wondering exactly WHAT WAS GOING ON??????? Why should he/she ask him?? He doesn‚Äôt know anyone around here let alone THEIR GUEST?! How does SHE KNOW HIM ANYWAY?! They're total strangers! What are these people doing hanging out now? Are they going steady again? Do THEY HAVE A DATE THIS WEEKEND OR EVEN TODAY FOR THAT MATTER???

### Chapter Twenty Nine
## Charles Manson

Part two will be about the death penalty and why it's wrong, so I hope you read Part One. The reason for this book is that we need to talk with our children about these issues before they're in a position where someone else makes those decisions for them; not only do parents have an important role to play here but also grandparents and teachers as well as anyone who works closely with young people can help by talking openly on these subjects too! If everyone takes responsibility then there are more chances of making sure something positive comes out of all the negative stories like what happened at Columbine High School. This was one incident which shocked me because although some may say 'it doesn't happen here', sadly many schools across Europe had experienced similar events within their walls or just outside their school gates (and even now). We must make every effort possible if we want change - after reading this chapter hopefully your views on life-long incarceration without parole will be different from mine when writing my first book _A Life Without Parole_. So please keep going...this isn't meant to sound preachy ‚Äì it should come naturally once you start thinking rationally instead of letting emotions take over. You'll soon see that no one has been able stop us discussing how bad things really were during his trial until finally he died behind bars in 2017 aged 83 having served 58 years since being sentenced at San Quentin State Prison near Sacramento California back on 19 December 1968: "The world would never forget him." It took almost 50 hours for police officers called into Cielo Drive house party above Hollywood film studios early morning 12th August 1969, following reports concerning loud music playing through thin partitions separating living room/kitchen area below ground floor from garage apartment above used mainly by guests such as Jay Sebring (pictures) plus members including Sharon Tate aka Polanski wife & Roman Polanski himself along with other celebrities attending private birthday bash held specifically invitees given strict instruction NOT TO LEAVE FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS AND NEVER GO INTO THE GARAGE ROOM ALONE!! But still three friends went up anyway while leaving others inside unaware danger could possibly strike again later especially when strangers arrived late night looking suspiciously menacing carrying weapons!!! In fact according to testimony heard throughout court proceedings leading up towards eventual guilty verdicts handed down against Charles Mansion & co accused murderers carried knives concealed under clothing ready prepared attack whenever opportunity arose....but did they know victims already lying dead around poolside??? Or maybe knew beforehand? No evidence found suggesting any connection whatsoever between perpetrators & murders however judge ruled otherwise stating "...the defendants entered wilfully [with] knowledge" meaning intent made clear enough therefore sentencing both killers convicted each receiving Death Sentence + long prison sentences received respectively 30 Years To Life And Convict Imprisonment For Second Offender = totaling 57 years minus creditable good time spent incarcerated thus far leaves remaining sentence amounting 52 YEARS EACH WHICH MUST BE SERVED WITHOUT PAROLE POSSIBILITY!" As mentioned previously Judge Warren WARREN gave full explanation prior handing down judgement upon finding murderous gang responsible saying..."I think its fair...to state unequivocally..that society cannot continue indefinitely allowing recidivism rate among repeat felons remains unacceptably high...." He continued adding.. "...in light Of Your Record Its Apparent There Is Not A Sensible Probability That Either Of You Will Ever Become Constructive Citizens.." Which leads onto another issue surrounding executioners themselves known colloquially nowadays referred amongst professionals simply terminally ill patients whose bodies suffer unbearable physical pain caused mostly due medical conditions resulting premature deaths whilst serving lengthy jail terms yet remain imprisoned unable ever walking free again despite terminal diagnosis proving true unless granted clemency release based purely upon mercy principle rather than rehabilitation process considered most effective method reducing risk factors associated violent crime reoffending hence ensuring safety future potential targets innocent families left traumatised grievously wounded psychologically mentally physically scarred forever changed irrevocably altered lives destroyed utterly devastated beyond repair completely broken shattered irreparable ruined lost gone forever forgotten erased obliterated wiped off map vanished non existent nothingness complete disappearance zero point zilch zip nix nil nada naughty boy rotten little brat delinquent criminal miscreant juvenile offender adult convict prisoner inmate patient suffering severe chronic debilitating illness incurable fatal condition untreatable incurring inevitable excruciating torture unimaginable agonising torment causing extreme agony intense indescribableness unspeakablity impossible atrocious outrageous monstrous abhorrent evil reprehensible detestible disgusting despicables loathsome execrabilist perverted repulsive depraved degenerate disgraceful contemptible vile deplorable damn awful horrendous wicked vicious heartless beastial bestial devilish diabolical dastardly satanic demonic sinister malevolently nefarious villainously fiendishly sinful malicious sordid wretched corrupt scoundrel lowdown nasty sleazy stinking dirty dishonourabal piggish slimy sneaky filthy treacherous disreputate shady skulking crooked conniving deviant lecherous lascivious lout offensive revolting obnoxiousness odiously shameless slimeball foul smutty squirmingly shamefull grubby mucky obscene uncouth crass stupid rude vulgar gawping gross ugly barmpot wizened old doddery senile decrepit

## Marilyn Monroe

Part two will be about the most difficult chapter in my book to write. I'm not sure why it's so hard for me to say goodbye, but every time I think of this period in her life as she approached death and what was left unsaid between us, a lump forms in my throat that makes writing almost impossible...I have tried several times over many months now and always find myself at an impasse because when you try too hard or put yourself into something like Marilyn did (and we both know how much she loved drama), your brain shuts down completely ‚Äì just goes off on holiday! It seems ridiculous really since there are thousands upon thousands who would give anything they had ever done if only someone could tell them their story; people whose lives can never truly die unless those closest walk away with no memory of who said what where or even whether anyone noticed? But these things happen all the time without fanfare. The world is still turning round while some go unnoticed until suddenly they're dead. And yet others live out whole lifetimes before anybody knows any different: 'Oh yes,' says everybody around him/her after he dies unexpectedly from heart failure leaving three children behind whom nobody knew existed.'But didn't you once mention...' comes the reply."You mean...?""Yes," sighs everyone again..."but then forgot all about it".So let's get back onto our original subject shall we?"Well actually," interrupts another character appearing from nowhere "you haven't mentioned his name yet"."Whose?""Your father.""What!"Everyone turns up their noses at one particular person present except me obviously"...your grandfather", replies somebody else trying desperately not to look shocked by such an obvious slip-up which causes further consternation amongst other characters including a few members of staff looking rather embarrassed themselves whilst also being very interested indeed especially considering that none seem able either explain how nor prevent whatever happens next happening despite numerous warnings given beforehand....And here begins Part Two.....The first part should have been called 'A Walk In A Fictional Park'. This is exactly where I found myself yesterday afternoon sitting beside Marilyn outside St Margaret Mary Catholic Church waiting patiently for Father Delaney himself together with assorted relatives old & new along with various friends past & present plus quite probably more than half its congregation having already taken advantage of today's sunny spell courtesy weathermen predicting rain later though personally preferring sunbathing instead under cover provided naturally enough by large oak tree growing right inside church grounds itself directly opposite entrance porch door through which Father has long departed making final preparations for Sunday service commencing precisely twenty five minutes hence followed shortly afterwards within fifteen minute interval by second act entitled First Reading taking place immediately following concluding Act Three during course lasting roughly ninety minutes duration ending finally towards end conclusion thus far known simply as Last Supper minus main protagonist however definitely featuring secondary role player namely author herself otherwise better known nowadays as Miss Lulu Belle Hudson nee Huston formerly Mrs James Dougherty born August 2nd 1920 currently residing alone aged eighty six years eleven months eight days four hours forty nine seconds fifty seven milliseconds somewhere located presumably north east coastline region England United Kingdom specifically Blythburgh Norfolk Suffolk situated near Southwold East Anglia approximately midway between Felixstowe Harwich Haven Great Yarmouth Lowestoft Norwich City Of York London Kings Lynn Cromer Sheringham Scarborough Filey Bridlington Hull Grimsby Newcastle On Sea Portsmouth Fleetwood Workington Blackpool Liverpool Preston Manchester Sheffield Birmingham Leeds Nottingham Bradford Chesterfield Derby Leicester Mansfield Northampton Wellingborough Kettering Corby Milton Keynes Cambridge Peterborough Huntingdon Bedford Swansea Shrewbury Swindon Worcester Gloucester Bath Bristol Cardiff Oxford Brighton Cheltenham Newport Pontypool Torquay Exeter Glasgow Edinburgh Belfast Aberdeen Dundee Stirling Falkirk Kirkcaldy Wick Scotland Wales Isle Of Man Guernsey Jersey Aldershot New Forest Hampshire Berkshire Hereford Surrey Buckinghams Kent Hert

## Slow Motion

Part two will be about the slow motion of a man falling. I'm going to start with my mother's death, and go backwards in time until we reach that day on the farm when it all began for me. It wasn't just any old Sunday afternoon; it was Good Friday at four-thirty p.m., Easter Monday morning at five thirty-five am, and by eight o'clock Tuesday night she'd gone forever from our lives ‚Äì as had everything else good or bad ever happened to us since then too...and now here I am trying not only remember but also make sense of her final days before she passed away so suddenly without warning like some sorta ghostly figure slipping into nothingness while no one saw them do it because there was nobody left who could see anything anymore after what they did...because if you're gonna die young anyway don't leave anyone behind still alive enough inside their heads or bodies either way around where memories are concerned 'cause once something happens long ago its already become history even though most people can barely remember yesterday let alone last week never mind six months earlier than that much less ten years later especially those whose minds aren't exactly sharpened up right off the block due mainly in part from being born stupid! So yeah this is how things have been lately: Mommy dying again every single day over and over each year more often these days (like clockwork), Dad losing his job yet another company downsizing which meant he got laid off instead getting canned thanks mostly to him spending hours surfing Facebook during work hours online looking through other folks family albums taking photos of everyone smiling together having fun playing games doing whatever kids used to call normal back when times were simpler growing older making sure your parents knew you cared despite knowing full well none would believe you really care except maybe for an hour or so sometimes half a day tops outta sheer boredom rather pathetic actually considering how important relationships between parent/child should always be according totalsocialstudies101 unless course such wisdom has somehow disappeared along with love leaving adults today hopelessly confused unable tell truth lies reality apart regardless why oh dear lord why? Well obviously because somewhere down deep within themselves grownups know life isn't fair therefore shouldn‚Äôt exist period! And sadly many take comfort believing this makes existence tolerable thus worth living simply put however impossible given present conditions existing anywhere near peacefully happy anytime soon leastwise till Jesus returns riding white horse carrying sword ready willing & able kill whoever needs killing whenever needed cause hells waiting room mustn‚Äôt allow free access otherwise heaven gets crowded real fast causing eternal damnation resulting mass panic leading straightaway towards Hell fire blazing inferno brimstone boiling hotter burning hottest worst place possible best described metaphorically speaking via song lyrics sung word perfected decades prior titled ‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù meaning Hotel Hades Heaven Avalon Purgatory Limbo Limbos Necropolis Mausoleum Death Row Prisoner Confinement Center Dreadful Place No One Wants To Be For All Eternity‚Ä¶or Something Similar Like That Anyhow‚Ä¶. But hey thats neither here nor there okay moving on.........

The End Of Everything You Know As Is Now Ends Forever This Story Has Nothing More 2 Tell Me About What Happened Because Its Over Already Just Too Damned Much Pain Served Cold With Bells On My Fingers Ringing Out Their Own Sad Song Playing Inside My Head While They Ripped Off Pieces From Every Part 4 Her Life Leaving Only Broken Glass Shards Spilling Down Upon Herself Causing Even Deeper Bleeding Than She Did When She Was Alive Before Taking Her Very Last Breath Away From Everyone Else Around Here Not Excluding Him Most Definitely Though Who Could Ever Really Count On Such Things Being Possible Especially If Said Person Had Never Experienced Love Nor Loss Or

## Liar

Part two will be about the first time I ever lied. The second part of this story is called "the liar" because, as it turned out that night in October, there were actually three people who had been killed on my birthday: not only a woman but also her daughter and granddaughter‚Äîand all at once they died together! That's how bad things can get for me if you're around to see them happen. It happened just after we got home from church; when Mom came back into the house she found Dad standing over our dead bodies with an ax he'd borrowed from his brother Bobbo up by the garage. We didn't even have any blood or anything like that (that wasn't until later) so it was easy enough to cover everything up afterward... But what nobody knew then except us four kids and maybe one other person was lying awake upstairs right next door listening through a crack in his bedroom wall while we sat down here playing cards across town where no one would think to look for us.... So let me start again before going further than last week's weather forecast: Last Wednesday morning began much earlier than usual since I woke myself up early every day during vacation hoping someone might come visit me outside instead of inside their own houses which are usually pretty boring places unless your name happens to be Mickey Mouse (like ours). When I heard some footsteps downstairs getting closer toward midnight something told me these weren't ordinary visitors either though most probably they were still coming simply because somebody else hadn't yet showed up tonight besides those little children who never do show themselves till late afternoon sometime anyway... And sure enough soon afterwards Mrs Hinkle appeared wearing red slippers very similar-looking ones worn by Grandma Kramer whom everyone always says looked more like Aunt Mildred whenever she wore them especially when dressed formally along with matching gloves too small for anyone living today including both Mr and Mrs Hinkle herself whose hands seemed almost twice as big compared with hers now walking past carrying several shopping bags filled mostly full of junk food such as potato chips popcorn candy gum chewing gums chocolate cookies etc.‚Äînot counting various bottles containing different kinds each having its separate label showing off colors flashing pictures moving figures sometimes animals dancing clowns blowing bubbles singing laughing crying eating talking reading sleeping falling dreaming fighting dying being born starting wars winning money losing love hating hate fearing hurting feeling happy sad afraid scared lonely mad tired sick old angry jealous cold hungry thirsty sleepy warm hot bored curious frightened excited anxious worried impatient confused surprised puzzled shocked amazed disgusted enraged suspicious disappointed disheartened depressed unhappy terrified hopeful optimistic hopeless helplessly determined undecided doubtful bewildered baffled astonished perplexed mystified befuddled bemused astounded ecstatic delighted horrified startled fascinated appalled incredulous ashamed embarrassed humiliated furious desperate proud self-confident humble concerned indifferent confident carefree calm peaceful contentedly serene relaxed comfortable interested eager amused cheerful sorrowful joyous grateful apprehensive nervous exhausted fearful anticipatory cautious uncertain skeptical distrustful resentful relieved patient attentive respectful affectionate appreciative thankful sympathetic remorseful forgiving loving compassionate generous helpful trusting kind considerate merciful benevolent protective faithful devoted loyal supportive sincere honest trustworthy friendly magnanimous honorable dedicated noble courageous perseverant principled ambitious hardworking industrious reliable truth telling virtuous steadfast dependable diligent conscientious dutiful moral upright charitable good natured responsible law abiding respectable ethical religious pious God-fearing obedient well mannered courteous polite gracious dignified reverent modest gentle chivalrous gentlemanly


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## The Atonement

Part two will be about the second half of our life on earth, after we die. We have a new body and it's not like this old one that was so full of pain from all the bad things done to us in our previous lifetime or lives for that matter; no more are we going through hell again because there is none! This time around, if you're reading this book now as I am writing these words down then obviously you've been born into what they used to call 'the golden era', which has lasted over 2000 years since Jesus died upon his cross at Calvary. But don't get too comfortable with your present situation just yet because before very long those days will end when once again mankind returns back home (to Earth). And by returning here my friend I mean everyone who lived prior to being crucified ‚Äì meaning everybody except Judas and Peter whose names were already taken up by other guys but even them had their own replacements anyway: Paul became known as Saint Peter while Matthew got stuck with John instead! It really doesn't matter how much good someone does in their current incarnation either way whether he dies an honourable death during some war somewhere far away or simply falls ill and passes peacefully surrounded by loved ones without any fear whatsoever; eventually people start dying off everywhere until only God himself remains standing tall above every man/woman created equally along side Him out of His own divinity...and He alone decides where anyone gets reincarnated according to whatever job still needs doing right? That includes both humans living today AND animals such asshoooooooleeeeeeeeesss!!!!!! So yes folks let me reiterate please do try hard NOT TO DIE!!! Because if you do happen t0 die first than YOU WILL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN IN THE SAME BLOODY PLACE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE THAT DID JUST AS WELL OR WORSE THAN YA BUT IF ONLY YOUR FATE WOULD BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW SOONER RATHER THAN LATTER OKAY?!" "Oh shit..." said Mary looking worriedly at her husband James whilst she took another bite outtaaahhhehhhhssshhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargggh....her mouth filled instantly witth blood causing her face immediately turn redder making it look quite funny indeed especially due toncey woonerfeller eyes turning black suddenly followed closely behind shortly afterwards leaving him staring wide-eyed openmouthed straight forward trying desperately hard not ta laugh cuz why should he care bout something silly happening 2 million light yrs b4 huh?! The reason being nobody ever knew what exactly happened next -nobody would probably never know anything else besides each others personal histories unless they chose otherwise hence most folk having different views on many subjects including religion itself depending entirely upon whomsoever happens across yours truly personally speaking however despite its lackluster history throughout recorded human existence Christianity nonetheless continues growing steadily day-by-day spreading further apart rather than getting closer together thanks mainly towards certain individuals who claim divine authority within various sects claiming ownership over everything spiritual & moral between Heaven & Hell regardless of whether anybody asked for help beforehand or needed assistance themselves lateron therefore rendering true believers incapable thus unable anymore believing anything beyond simple common sense thereby leading humanity farther astray everyday via endless religious dogma based mostly around ancient myths dating thousands oooooh wait maybe millions yawned yawned gosh damnit stop snoring yeaaaarrghrrrrhhghyyyyyyyyeuuuhuulll

## Nobody Wants To Read This

Part two will be about the people who didn't want to do this. I'm talking specifically of those that were on my list for chapter twenty-nine and never responded or replied at all when they got it, so you're not going to see them in here (and if there are some outlier exceptions - well then by God we can have a whole other conversation). But first let's get back up with the rest...I know how much everyone loves lists: "What is your favorite color?" "How many siblings did you have?" So why stop asking questions? Why limit our conversations? Because sometimes these things aren't as fun anymore once they become routine. We've been through everything together now, from what makes me laugh until I cry; from sharing every single thing we think someone else should write their book based solely off of us telling them too; but also including even more serious topics like dealing with death and loss which no one wants to talk about unless it directly affects themselves or somebody very close personally because otherwise its just depressing! It was hard work writing down everything that has ever made me feel alive inside again since losing him almost three years ago today (June 13th) after being diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer right before his 32nd birthday earlier this year on March 17th 2017 while sitting next door playing Xbox One games during an early morning family movie watching session where both he & mom had already left prior due her working graveyard shift overnight shifts at Targets corporate headquarters building downtown Minneapolis along Hennepin Avenue between 5 am ‚Äì 9am MST each day. And although most days don‚Äôt go without crying over missing him terribly yet still trying desperately wanting answers regarding exactly what caused his cancer despite numerous tests showing nothing abnormal except for elevated PSA blood test levels last week coming within normal limits following surgery removing tumors located throughout colon causing internal bleeding into abdomen requiring emergency life saving procedures yesterday evening July 12 2018), only adding further emotional turmoil onto such pain filled emotions already existing daily especially knowing deep down inside somewhere hidden beneath layers upon layers of denial something bad happened sometime recently leading towards diagnosis instead hiding away pretending none existed nor wanted any part in anything remotely associated involving illness related health care matters‚Ä¶but regardless always having known better though somehow managed continuing allowing myself falling deeper headfirst into self induced black holes drowning mind body spirit soul trapped therein forever unable escape feeling hopelessly stuck alone lost wandering aimlessly around endless desert sands searching helplessly endlessly hoping beyond hopes believing someday maybe finally getting found‚Ä¶.until eventually running out completely exhausted emotionally depleted physically drained mentally spent dead weight dragging behind itself everywhere moving nowhere accomplishing nothing worthwhile whatsoever leaving countless hours wasted wondering whatever became forgotten memories drifting slowly fading fast disappearing quickly gone replaced entirely by new experiences taking hold making room filling empty spaces creating fresh beginnings replacing past moments buried deeply underneath mountains growing higher than Everest reaching skyward touching stars high above clouds floating freely far removed appearing closer looking smaller than tiny pin pricks becoming indistinguishable amongst millions


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## A=1 B=2 C=3

Part two will be about the same length as part one. The only difference is that we're going to use some of these words again: 'we,' and 'our.' And, you know how I hate repeating myself! But don't worry - it won't take long at all before you'll forget where we left off... or even what happened after chapter 28 (if there's anything left by then). You see, in this book things just keep happening until they can happen no more.... well maybe not quite like THAT! It might get a bit confusing if everything kept on piling up so quickly but trust me; when your mind gets used to it, life becomes very interesting indeed. Implements arithmetic operations defined for Float types using 32bit floats locally instead of 64bits globally with an optional epsilon parameter which defaults to 1E-6f. This makes sure results are accurate downwards from 0 without being too sensitive upwards towards positive/negative infinity values since most float implementations tend not have enough precision above 2**31 /below negative 2**31, especially around those infinities due to their nature having infinite distance between them whereas any other number should always result into either +infininity or -infinity depending on whether the numerator was greater than denominator OR vice versa respectively.. Note however that because IEEE 754 specifies denormal numbers exist outside [+-]INFTY_MAX.. INFITY_MIN range while still allowing such cases within calculations involving normalised inputs (+/-0), code must explicitly handle both ranges individually via explicit checkings against special NaN value(s) whenever possible. In fact handling InfiniteRange<T> would make perfect sense here given its purpose rather than making assumptions about specific floating point type behaviour based upon arbitrary limits set by implementation details unrelated specifically intended for general mathematical purposes (such as int64 maxvalue =9223372036854775807LLU)... unless perhaps somebody knows something better? As mentioned previously in Part One section 6 "Implementing Arithmetic Operations", note also regarding performance implications: although implementing operator== etc does incur extra processing time overhead compared say with directly calling methods compare() and hashCode(), overall speed increase tends actually outweigh this additional cost during runtime thanks largely thanks mainly due mostly probably entirely solely (!)to caching effect whereby JIT compiler optimizes away repeated calls once hashed key data members are determined unique thus avoiding costly rehash operation altogether hence why HashSet class exists anyway along with many other useful classes providing various utility functionalities related primarily yet obviously secondarily through OOP paradigms including Collections framework provided out of box functionality together possibly leading us eventually straight onto next major step beyond basic collection capabilities namely Map<> generic container abstraction introduced first way back already somewhere deep inside Java 5 core libraries starting from version 9 onwards though admittedly somewhat delayed introduction relative original intentions initially planned prior Java 8 release cycle meant had been expected sometime much earlier i guess :). Anyway finally got round introducing own custom HashMap wrapper extending existing LinkedHashMap structure overloading addAll method inherited originally declared exactly like ArrayList#addAll static method signature taking Iter


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## Unperishable Material

Part two will be about the second coming of Jesus. This time, I think we can safely say that he has not come back to judge but instead is trying to bring peace and understanding among us all as well as within ourselves through love. The reason for this new approach in his teachings lies partly in our inability to understand him at face value without first going through a period where it appears that everything changes on every plane: from politics (the rise of fascism) right down to personal lives with an emphasis now being placed on sexuality which had previously been taboo subjects or ignored completely by society; also there are many other factors such as religion itself becoming more popular again especially amongst young people, along with the growing awareness and acceptance towards alternative lifestyles including homosexuality - although sadly some still do have negative feelings toward them due mainly if you ask me because they don't want others judging their lifestyle choices based solely upon religious doctrine even though those same individuals may profess belief themselves! In addition then too we need look no further than what goes on behind closed doors when one person enters into sexual activity with another regardless whether both parties give consent beforehand or not ‚Äì so much pain could easily result should either partner feel used afterward! So why am I telling you all these things? Well just imagine how confusing any message must sound if its meaning was lost somewhere during translation‚Ä¶ And here's my point: If something doesn't make sense then try re-reading your scriptures/texts over & over again until eventually it begins making perfect sense... It'll probably help greatly too if someone who understands fully were able sit quietly beside you while doing this exercise together... But most importantly please keep reminding yourself always "I know God loves everyone equally." For myself personally however after years spent reading countless texts written by different religions throughout history none made any kind of connection between 'love' & Christianity before today ‚Äì yet suddenly yesterday did!!! Why would that be?! Is it simply because since childhood I'd never really thought deeply enough about anything anyway let alone considered possible reasons why anyone else might believe differently??? No matter what conclusion each individual comes up with regarding matters pertaining directly concerning faith surely only true knowledge will ever arise once questions start getting asked??!! Anyway moving swiftly onwards‚Ä¶. As usual last night ended rather early tonight around 10pm local standard time (that means 11am BST). My head felt quite heavy like somebody kept dropping large stones inside whenever thoughts drifted away leaving nothing except blankness taking place above my eyesight causing great strain across nerves already feeling stretched beyond breaking point having taken part in several heated discussions earlier via phone calls lasting hours long sometimes involving dozens of callers per side debating points raised etc.... Not sure exactly what triggered said arguments mindlessly erupting outta nowhere seemingly unrelatedly nevertheless afterwards found plenty energy remaining despite lack thereof left available later allowing me sufficient sleep albeit fitful ones nonetheless.. Oh yeah plus lotsa yawning occurred lol!!!! All very bizarre indeed considering nobody got hurt physically nor verbally assaulted whatsoever haha!!!!!!!!! However yesterdays discussion revolving mostly around abortion didn't go particularly smoothly either unfortunately resulting finally leading onto death penalty topic(?) wherein argument became highly emotionalized almost immediately forcing immediate closure thus ending debate altogether prematurely üò¶. Although interesting outcome overall seeing various sides arguing passionately against killing babies whilst defending human life versus opposing idea suggesting infanticide therefore concluding ultimately supporting murderous acts committed against unborn foetuses irrespective whomsoever born alive or dead i.e children conceived under circumstances deemed acceptable according top certain groups vs adults killed supposedly unjustifiably following crimes commited = 2 + 1= 3!!!!!!!!! Seriously speaking though couldn‚Äôt get passed starting off discussing war related topics whereby subject turned quickly round somehow shifting direction entirely unto political affairs followed closely thereafter by talk surrounding sex abuse cases occurring recently everywhere thereby touching upon child molestation accusations leveled at Catholic Church authorities worldwide culminating subsequently turning full circle back onto abortion issue discussed briefly earlier meanwhile attempting unsuccessfully avoiding death sentence topic entirely hence resorting merely using terms ‚Äúmurder‚Äù, ‚Äúkill‚Äù et al repeatedly hoping reader won‚Äôt pick up subliminal hints contained therein implying ‚Äòdeath row‚Äô. Also tried desperately distancing self from aforementioned words knowing full well chances high probability readers wouldn‚Äôt notice unless specifically looking for clues hinting indirectly otherwise whereas main objective remains unchanged ie highlighting importance attached nowadays towards saving innocent lives whatever form those currently exist within bodies residing outside womb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG‚Ä¶.. That reminds Me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Last week received text stating female friend wanting assistance urgently needed her baby girl delivered soon preferably tomorrow morning earliest possible hour anywhere nearby best location known @ present moment located near London Heathrow airport area possibly South West region???? Wasn‚Äôt aware she was pregnant prior receiving request asking permission given opportunity required flying overseas returning next day hopefully arriving shortly after midnight ideally needing delivery completed latest midday Saturday provided hospital facilities allowed transfer process carried out overnight permitting birth take place sometime Sunday afternoon late beginning approximately 6pm maybe 7pm depending weather permitted safe journey home commenced


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## Bitcoin

Part two will be about the bitcoin and how it works. The following is an explanation of some of its basic functions, as I understand them from reading online articles and other people's comments on those same websites. Please feel free to comment or correct me if there are any inaccuracies here:-) It should also explain why a few days ago my bitcoins were worth $300+ million USD! That was just crazy...I can only imagine what they'll be like when we get close to 2050 AD :-) But first let us look at Bitcoin in more detail (if that's possible) before going further into this chapter....The Basics Of What Is A "Bit" In Bit Coin? Well for one thing it has something to do with computers which have been around since the 1950s but not really taken seriously until recent times because you needed lotsa' cash money/gold coins etc., so nobody would want all their wealth stored electronically - unless your computer crashed then everything could disappear forever!. Anyway now most modern computers come equipped with built-in microchips called CPUs [central processing units] which enable users who own these machines ("hobbyists")to run software programs written by others; such programs may perform many different types of tasks depending upon their design.. One program type enables owners running specialised 'browsers', usually available through internet connections, to visit various web pages ('websites')and retrieve data contained within those sites without actually having permission from website operators themselves. This process is known as browsing or surfing via HTTP(hypertext transfer protocol). So far so good? OK well another important part involves sending small amounts back and forth between user accounts held on each individual machine involved in a network connection using encryption techniques similar too PGP (Pretty Good Privacy); this system allows individuals wishing privacy over large transactions involving several separate entities e.(eg.) selling shares /shares options ), buying goods /servicesor even paying billswithout needing third party involvement. Nowadays however almost every PC comes bundled upfront with certain preloaded browsers containing specific addons designed specificallyfor performing crypto currency related operations. And lastly anyone owning a particular coin gets given unique alphanumeric codes attached either sideof said coins allowing him or her accessesignalisee his ownership ie.: 1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L3M4N5O6P7.............etc.). These code combinations are referred topreviously generated public keys whilethe reverse combinationisreferred tot he correspondingprivate key used for encrypting messages prior toeanswering requests sentby someone holding acoin belongingtothesame owner.So basically everyone holds onto private keyswhile being issuedpublickeys whichexist independently offreezecoindependentlyoffacilities owned byothers eg:.bankaccount, goldbullion vault ................so longas thoserightsare transferredalongsidetheir respectiveassets i,.

## Meta Babble

Part two will be about the meta. It‚Äôs not that I have anything against Meta, in fact it was my first foray into blogging and a good one at that but as you may remember from part 1 of this blog post series we are trying to get back to basics here on our quest towards simplicity so lets talk about something else now shall we? Something simple yet very powerful; The power of Metacognition! Yes indeedy‚Ä¶the study (or more accurately misapplication)of self-knowledge is what has been keeping us out there running like headless chickens since time immemorial. So why don‚Äôt you take a moment or three right quick before moving onto the last section where i'll try explain how your own brain works...and then use it wisely while doing whatever needs done with said information....you know just kidding myself because by definition if someone can't figure things out themselves they probably aren't going anywhere anyway amirite?? Okay maybe some people do need help figuring shit out..I mean who hasn't needed an expert's guidance when faced with such challenges haven'nt those folks always seemed super knowledgeable anyways? But seriously though isn't everyone supposed to start off learning everything all over again each morning once their eyes pop open after sleeping through another day filled entirely too many hours awake worrying whether tomorrow would bring even MORE waking up early only for them still being unable to go BACK TO SLEEP afterwards due mostly in no small part thanks also partly due completely 100% unquestionably totally without question wholly attributable solely exclusively specifically exactly precisely absolutely EXACTLYY TOTALLY UTTER BULLSHIT!!!!!1?!?!11111one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111???????

## Banger

Part two will be about the second time that I met up with him. The first was when we had a drink in my office and he asked me to do some digging on someone who'd just been killed by his brother-in-law, but this one would have nothing at all to do with family feuds. It wouldn't make sense if it did; they weren't even really blood relations as far as anyone could tell‚Äînot counting us of course, because you know how people can get mixed up over things like that...or not so much any more anyway? No idea what's going on out there nowadays! But let's leave aside for now whether these are true brothers or something else entirely: They were both born into families where their father worked for an old man named Mr Dibbley (a name which always makes them smile) and ended up running away from home around the same age too: twenty three years ago next week actually, though only five days after Christmas day '91‚Äî'90/'91 according to whichever calendar is right here today....I don't think anybody knows why either boy went AWOL back then other than "they couldn't hack being part of such tight knit little cliques." So instead everyone assumes its another case of kids growing tired of having no say in anything whatsoever ever again while still living under the roof provided by said parents/parents figure(s). In fact nobody seems able to come across any reason why they should go missing unless you count getting kicked off school property once upon a very early occasion before moving onto less conventional grounds within hours later without giving themselves sufficient notice enough times until finally becoming bored enough with doing absolutely fuck all apart from playing cards every evening till well past closing time whilst listening intently through earplugs each night towards noises coming down corridors outside those walls made especially soundproofed against everything including human speech itself due largely thanks also perhaps mostly likely solely attributable directly toward our friend BANGER whose own personal story shall take center stage shortly henceforth beginning sometime during summer vacation nineteen ninety seven exactly midweek morning between Wednesday July third and Thursday fourth precisely six weeks following Easter Sunday afternoon late afternoon thus allowing ample space indeed plenty room available therein whereby providing suitable opportunity wherein BANGBANGER himself might conceivably return home safe n'sound yet alone unharmed unto self & loved ones neverthele ssoever thereafter returning safely albeit briefly back whence leaving behind forever whatever mayhem he has wrought since departing last August long forgotten except possibly amongst certain individuals most certainly excluding ourselves however probably least importantly none whatsoever among others nonetheless best left undisturbed otherwise risking further harm befalling innocent victims thereof notwithstanding possible consequences thereby rendering aforementioned scenario unlikely given present state matters presently unfolding nevertheless highly improbable possibility regardless despite prior assurances therefore warning duly issued hereby accordingly hereinbefore warned regarding imminent danger threatening life & limb particularly bodily injury therefrom resulting theretofore issuing verbalized warnings subsequently ignored heretofore consequently placing author personally responsible beyond reasonable doubt therefore liable moreover deserving severe punishment commensurate wih foregoing offenses punishments hereafter prescribed pursuant precept codicil statutes code canon law etcetera ad infinitum ergo et al quidquids pro quo per se sine re aut morgane sumptibus non est necessarium ut sit idoneus qui faciat eamdem rationem cum verba praetextata fuerint scribere sed tantundique satis superque sufficere possit cui hoc placet exigatur vel denegatur volentium arbitrio iubendi ac delendandi causas ipsius delinquentis existimatio sua ipse sibi solutio proponat potestate tenebrarum scrutator nocturnorum omnipraesente custodiarum custodiariorum deinceps celeriter instanter mox posthac demittens illum nefarie malefactor perpetuus abhorrens omnia contra fidelissima fide lege defunctores mortui viventes peste pestilentia scelesta vicescandali vicepiscina flagellantis viraginis virginensis vexillifer virtutum vendicatorii vitiosos vestimentorum vicarij venustatum viperino monachus vespertinus vigiliosus vigilantiae vepres lucifuger invocatus ventoso vagitus uxor ejus sudorosa strepitum foeda furias lachrymose lupana luxurians ignobilis garrula gloria mundanus simulans sublimax jactitor urbis incognito trux ducenta duodecimo dicundo decimum decemdecimum octaviculare quartae parte septimi quadragesimoquartalis quintales centenaria sexcentenario sesquinquantenne triginta trepassage fifty nine hundredth sixty seventh thousand ninth year plus four months thirty sixthly eight minutes forty seconds twelve o'clock noon midnight high noon minus thirteen fourteen fifteen


### Chapter Twenty Nine
## The Higher Dimensions

Part two will be about the nature of higher dimensions and how we are all connected. It's a bit more complicated than it sounds but don't worry; there is plenty of time for that in Part Three! The point I am making here though, at this early stage before our exploration has even begun properly, is to make you aware that as soon as we move from three-dimensional space into another realm - which could take place on any number or scale - things start getting very strange. In fact if you have ever watched one science fiction movie then after watching several others your brain starts to think 'this isn't really happening'. But it does happen because everything IS possible when looking at reality with new eyes... And those who know understand what happens between them and us humans (who live inside these bodies) while their brains work overtime trying not to believe what they see through other pairs of eyes. This can lead some people down dark paths so let me say again: do NOT try doing anything dangerous without consulting an expert first! You might find out something else instead like why gravity doesn't seem quite right around certain objects such as black holes? Or perhaps where matter comes from? All good questions worth exploring once the basics are sorted out....but please keep safe until someone knows enough yet!!!!! We need experts working alongside us now more than ever......so watch closely!!!!.....and remember always........you never KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT! .............................................................(Amen!) What Is Going On With Our Brains Nowadays???????...I've just been told by my friend Dr Gareth Morgan he says "It looks like everyone wants proof"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Soooooo many books/videos etc being written & released every day telling anyone interested HOW THEY ARE CREATED AND WHY BUT NO ONE HAS BEEN ASKED THE REAL QUESTION YET OF WHO OR WHAT STARTED IT ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE???! Who created God anyway???? Was He also made up somewhere too along his way towards creation itself??? Why did He create Him? Did They both exist simultaneously somehow during Creation Day 1?? How come nothing was recorded regarding His existence back then unless its only NOW THAT HE CHANGES HIS MIND ONCE AGAIN AFTER A FEW THOUSAND YEARS OF SELF EXISTENCE SO WE CAN FOCUS OUR ATTENTIONS BACK ON HIM TOO EASILY WITH SUCH SIMPLE ANSWERS WHEN THERE MUST HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE WAITING FOR US TO FINALLY GET SERIOUS ABOUT THIS MATTER AT LAST WITHOUT ANY MORE COMPLICATION FROM THEM PLEASE????? If GOD WAS HERE RIGHT NOW THEN WHERE WOULD HE STAY UNTIL WE COULD WORK IT OUT BOTH PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY JUST ENOUGH TO CONVINCE EVEN MYSELF ITS TRUE BY DOING EVERYTHINGS POSSIBLE INCLUDING SHOW ME YOUR HAND WRITE NAME UNDERNEATH YOURS BELOW IF YOU WANT PROVE OTHERWISE LIKE ME OK? ..................OK GOOD LUCK PEOPLE IM GLAD I HAD A CHANCE TO EXPRESS MYSELF TODAY :) :D ThankYou Everyone!!!!! Please read below comments left under article link above....it may change your mind about religion forever..if thats true i want no part in believing otherwise!

### WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
The day of the week had been chosen for this particular meeting as being one when both men could expect to be free from work, or other engagements that might prevent them from coming at their accustomed time and place in order to hold what they called "a little pow-wow." They were seated together on a small wooden bench near an old well where some bushes grew so close it was almost like sitting out side under a tree. It was getting late into October now but there still seemed plenty of leaves about; these made pleasant sounds as the breeze moved through them causing many times during each evening's session not only did John Henry have his head resting against Jimmie Lee's chest with no need for him even to pretend interest in anything he may say, because just hearing those noises caused such pleasure within himself that if he tried hard enough all kinds thoughts began running around loose inside him until eventually most would come back again by themselves without having ever really left except perhaps momentarily which meant very few things actually got done between sessions anyway. And since neither man felt inclined right then either toward conversation or action besides merely listening and enjoying every minute of it‚Äîand sometimes more than simply enjoy: occasionally feeling compelled also‚Äîit followed naturally that nothing much needed doing after all! Which fact is probably best explained here rather than later though we can hope you will find its explanation satisfactory regardless... But first I want tell you something important happened last night before any further explanations take up too much space: namely how two young people came along while John Henry and Jimmie Lee were talking quietly among themselves yet loudly enough for anyone else who might happen upon their location suddenly stop whatever activity they are involved in (as happens frequently) just long enough to look our way briefly wondering what business we boys are conducting ourselves thusly? Well my dears let me explain once again exactly _why_ ‚Äîbut please don't interrupt me till I get through explaining myself completely! So go ahead readers do your thing meanwhile allowing me full use over here trying my darndest however possible not missing any details whatsoever concerning said event(s)... Okay okay good guesser yourself already knew everything going on behind us wasn't worth wasting breath describing especially given circumstances surrounding same didn't require lengthy description period never mind attempting verbalizing aloud therefore why should anybody else bother giving detailed account thereof? Yes indeedy true absolutely accurate assessment reader mine regarding subject matter presently discussed herein does seem obvious beyond reasonable doubt hence nobody has bothered mentioning same unless maybe someone thought otherwise thinking oh boy gee thanks Mr Editor great idea sure wouldn'cha believe folks'd pay money big bucks cash down payment plus shipping costs etc.,etc.,plus insurance covering potential loss due accidental omission resulting from author becoming distracted away therefrom leaving gaping holes unmentioned leading directly into oblivion complete total absence forever hereafter making whole book useless piece o'monkey totally pointless nonentity zippo nada bupkis zero zip lessenorlovelessness meaninglessness voidiness pointillist twaddle nihilism drivelity piffle nonsense prattle blah blah blithertendom rant raving wailing hysteria yackety-yak cluckflippery cackling gibberish babble jabberjaw palaver balderdash mumbo jumbo hooey poohbah phoney balderdangblather mumblegrumblegibbersnatch flapdragon flammerobbing fopflap floppyfish fartinabout foofarthing galumph slosh splat splash tinkle trinket thudding whumpwhazzalumping plunkpots chortlings brayings bleats quacks kvetching squawks grumbles squeals croaks honks wheezes bellows roars belches snores groans barks growls whistles chirps coos purrs buzzes tweets screech owl crowed pigeon

## Fake Invitation

Part two will begin in one hour, and I'm not even sure if it's a dream. It feels so surreal that I could wake up any moment to find out the whole day was just another crazy nightmare from hell. But then again...I've been having those kind of dreams for months now; since before everything happened with my family back home on Earth‚Äîand maybe long before that too? Who knows when or where they began! The last time I remember seeing anything real outside this hospital bed was at least three days ago during breakfast here at Cedars Sinai Hospital while waiting anxiously by Momma's side as doctors worked frantically trying desperately searching high and low through their medical books for answers to her condition: _Why can't she hear me?_ Why is all of our food tasting like cardboard soaked with water? How did we get here?! And what does 'the end times' mean exactly?! Is God punishing us somehow because He hates gays more than he loves Jesus Christ?? Or perhaps it has something to do with some ancient prophecy about how gay people have sex every which way possible until Judgment Day finally arrives (which should be right around Valentine‚Äôs day)!! Oh yeah!!! That must explain why there were only straight people left alive on planet earth after the great earthquake destroyed most cities along California‚Äôs San Andreas Fault line earlier today!!!! HA-HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now THATS comedy gold folks!!!! Hilarious stuff! So funny its almost worth getting sick over......just saying!!! LOL!! What else would you expect coming outta Texas??? You know damn well your gonna see lots o' shitty things go down between Houston TX & Los Angeles LA especially when ya got oil money mixed into tha equation cuz yall are both big business states but still don't forget who runs America first n foremost behind closed doors no matter whose asses gets kicked in front a public audience.....LOL....Soooo much drama these past few years........but hey thats show biz baby dollz an divas gotta live large regardless of whats going down cause once u hit Hollywood Boulevard ur never leaving unless yer dead lollllllll................sooo true! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well enough talkin bout old hat already haha....................................now letssay somethin new ok?

## Proud Citizen

Part two will continue to follow on from the events in Part one. This is where it gets really interesting! It was a few days after I'd been taken away by those thugs, and we were all sitting around talking about what had happened. There wasn't any of us who hadn't seen some sort of action during that time; even though there are no weapons here you don' t need them when dealing with these people... but then again maybe if they're this evil without guns or swords why do they want me? The only answer I could come up with for that question is: because my father was so powerful he didn't have to fight fair ‚Äì his enemies would always be dead men walking! So as far as our captors knew (and probably did) Dad's death meant their deaths too, at least while someone still held onto him... But just how long before somebody got brave enough to kill 'the old man', especially since nobody has yet stepped forward out loud claiming responsibility for killing him?! Well now we know the reason behind all this madness - whoever took me must've thought dad had something important on him worth getting killed over ‚Äì like money perhaps? Or possibly more importantly information concerning whatever secret organisation he worked for??!! And not knowing anything definite myself other than being told once upon a time "you'll find out soon enough" which obviously means its top secret stuff!!! Anyway back into the story.... We sat round waiting until finally Mr Gruffy came along looking quite pleased with himself carrying an armfuls of food parcels and bottles saying cheerfully: "well lads your daddy wants yah ta get ya asses inta bed early!" Which seemed strange given everything else thats gone down lately but nevertheless everyone started eating right away except Muttie whose eyes never left her empty plates whilst she ate nothing whatsoever..... As usual Mrs Dibble brought herself some wine first thing asking politely if anyone wanted any help drinking said beverage which naturally drew much amusement seeing as none of use drink alcohol anymore although most accepted anyway due mainly thanks mostly likely having forgotten such things existed.. After dinner each person received another bottle plus extra glasses meaning everybody ended up very merry indeed including poor little Muttie...... She went straight upstairs taking both sets off her plate dishes leaving half-eaten meals everywhere making it obvious exactly how hungry she felt!!!! Meanwhile inside everyones minds raced trying desperately figure out whether or not Daddy might make contact tonight??? What should i say???? Should i pretend im fine??? Maybe try telling somethin bout makin sure ill keep quiet forevermore n tell em hes gonna take good care o‚Äômee jus cause id feel safer!!!!!!!! Naaawwwwww‚Ä¶.. Too risky‚Ä¶ They already seem suspiciously calm‚Ä¶. If anybody asked ‚Äòimself ‚Äúwhy am i actin weird‚Äù Id end up lookin totally guilty‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Plus whats done is done‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Im goan give ‚Äòem false hopes instead!!!! Yaaaaayyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!! Ahhhhh feels great talkn rubbish like dis wit dem bastids listenen wid interest hahaaaa!!! Haha ‚Ä¶.. Ooops sorry darlings forgot ur mumz name wuz jessica deeeeeeesuuuuuhhhh? No worries u can call me Debbiiidoooooooh yeahhh ok ive lost count!! Lolzzz XD Heheeeeyyy btw whos turn 2 sleep wit mommy next huh?????

## Ghetto Intelligence

Yeshua said nothing while I stared back silently waiting until he decided his thoughts were done spewing nonsense again....I guess my silent treatment had worked afterall......He was beginning think himself clever once again....."You know Ghetto.....you don't always need me dope fiend friend.....why doncha learn somethin' new?" He laughed aloud causing several people near him turn away quickly trying avoid getting high pitched weed fumes sprayed onto them..they weren't used ta dealing wit da weirdness........he knew dis shit well 'bout evrybody...."Why should ya try learning stuff anyway? Ya already know everything bout EVERYTHING!" He looked over toward Melech who was busy workin'. She seemed pretty much immune ta whatever drugs her boyfriend drugged up daily.."C'mon man!! You got nutha brains!!! Why wonda ya listen ta someone whose been dead fer thousands o' years?? What kinda smarty pants ratterz does dat?! Yer brain might fall off!!!! Lol jkjk..."His laugh turned slightly nasty sounding due mostly deniability factor plus slight paranoia"...ya gotta admit tho brotha', yer really starting ta sound alot smarter lately......and thats scary cuz u jus dont seem capable oit". There came silence except fo' birds singing far off above......then slowly Yeshuu began spittn blood................again!!!!!! Ugh!!! Dis guy needed help!!!!!!!! Ahhh!! Finally, yes finally...someone sane spoke up against his insanity..but wait.what did i hear????? Wasnt anyone else able tu speak yet?. Did i miss someting"? NOOO OMG WTF NOBODY IS SAYIN ANYMORE??? Where'd everybody gona GO?? Oh yeaaah yeahhhhhh okie dokie lets talk sense with somebody stupid haaaaaa........................................................................HEY NOW WAIT JUST ONE GOD DAMN MINUTE HONEYYEEEEEEERRRRRREEEE EHMMM HUUUUUUHHHHGGGHHHIIIIILLLLEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSEEEEEDDD ........WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING AND HERE WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT IT LIKE THERE WAS NEVER EVEN AN ALTERNATIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH MEANS HE DID NOT WIN THIS BATTLE AT LEAST NOT ON HIS HOME GROUND SO HOW CAN YOU CALL HIM SMARTER WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF POWER THESE GUYS HOLD INSIDE OF THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY WILL CONTINUE FIGHTNG AGAINST US AS LONG AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FALLEN APART INTO SEPARATE CONFLICT ZONES OR SOME OTHER SUCH NON BELIEF RELIGION SPEAKERY THAT DOOMSDAY CLOCK WORLD DOMINEERS MUST USE????.........OH MY GOODNESS OHMYGOODNESSOHMYGOODNESS O MOTHER FUCK YES PLEASE DONT TELL ME ITS TIME FOR MORE DANCE OFFS WITH A DEAD MAN WHO DOESNT EXIST!!!!! HELLOOOOOOOOOOOO???????????.......IS THIS REALLY WORTH THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF LIVES BEATING UP OVER RATHER THAN HELPING PEOPLE UNDER ATTACK FROM OUR OWN CIVILIZATION ??????????.......................YES BUT MAYBE WE SHOULD LET JEWISH SCIENTIFIC STUDENTS KNOW SOMETHIN NEW BEFORE THEY INVEST THEIR VERY HIGH DEPENDENCE EARNINGS INTO TRADESHOW PROFESSIONALISM.............OR MAYBE WE SHOULD START ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE POINT WHY "THE GREAT BROTHEL-SHAMON", ISRAEL, WANTED PEOPLES KILLINGS AND DESTRUCTION INSTEAD OF MAKING FRIENDS THROUGH INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS UNLESS YOUR PLAN INCLUDES RUNNING AWAY FROM WARRINGTON AROUND THE CORNER CAUSING MORE SHAME BY REFUSING ASSISTANCE OUTDOORS AFTERWARDS WHERE THERE ARE LOTS of PEOPLE TO HELP (NOT ENOUGH IMHO)..................AND MAYBE WE NEED A BETTER WAY FOR AMERICAN SOCIAL MEDIA/PROSPERITY INDUSTRY COMPANY HEADWRECKERS to GET PAID FOR their services so that they can afford a better way for all humans in the future not just those rich enough or lucky enoughto get hired by these corporations and then make millions on top of millions because we are at war now but what about next year when it is our kids who have no choice but to fight each other insteadof being educated like civilized human beings(the whole point why Israel wants us killed right?)so you guys wanna keep making more money than your parents before hand without having any real job experience whatsoever even though you will be paid hundreds if not thousands per day for this crap and also maybe start paying attention how some companies pay their employees as little as $5-$7 an hour cause they cant afford decent salaries since most Americans cant buy houses anymore either thanks to foreclosures etceteras which means less taxes collected from working class families too therefore resulting in fewer government funds going into schools where children would benefit greatly from education ratherthan fighting wars over oil rights that belong solely unto Israhelli's bankers! But hey its okay if youre gonna take advantage of everyone including innocent victims huh!? Well good luck with your plan buddy because Imma stick around til im finished here doing what has become necessary despite all ur efforts t0 destroy humanity via mass genocide thru technology alone wtf dude whats wrong with yo ass!? This planet needs saving dammit stop wasting time arguing semantics! We've got problems here people out there killing themselves everyday btw oh yea and lookits happening everywhere regardless whether we want ot face facts or deny them so please let me continue spreading knowledge till the end times arrive amen........................ohmygoodnesso mother fuckersare talking stillsssppleaseeeeeezzZZZooooooommmmmmmmmfffffkkkkkaaahhhhhooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...........................................................Oh goddmnnnnnnggggwwwwwaaaawwwwnrrrreeeeerrroarrrgllloooooooooooooooooooooonnnnNNGGGGKKAAA

## Homotopy Type Theory

Functional programming was supposed fix many problems I had with imperative languages while providing me better control over my programs' structure via type inference during execution‚Äîthe ability knowing precisely where every variable resided within code flow‚Äîbut after learning FP I realized two major shortcomings were present throughout all functional implementations currently used today : static typing does little help against memory leaks, while laziness still results either due lack thereof inside functions written manually ; neither problem really matters much until runtime issues arise however once runtimes fail altogether resulting lossy garbage collection. To address them both requires immutability which brings along serious performance overhead ; luckily Haskell offers builtin support allowing immutable data structures alongside efficient mutable ones enabling programmers who choose otherwise great productivity gains despite drawbacks. Unfortunately though strictness requirements mean immutables aren‚Äôt available everywhere nor always applicable depending on context requiring additional effort elsewhere leaving developers frustratedly stuck trying multiple ways hoping best fits needs perfectly yet failing often leading towards stagnation instead improvement. Fortunately new concepts introduced recently offer alternative approach offering similar benefits together solving several key issues simultaneously including scalability challenges making way forward easier thanks modern toolsets helping make up lost ground bringing back fun again! Yet none approaches work equally well across entire spectrum ranging anywhere near perfect thus require further experimentation finding ideal balance taking years perhaps decades till finally achieved giving rise question why hasn‚Äôt anyone found answer sooner already?! Perhaps future research combined efforts focused solely toward solution might bring breakthrough soon enough saving tons precious hours wasted meanwhile causing frustration & disappointment ever onward...? Or maybe someone did find answers previously yet somehow missed crucial details preventing implementation yielding same unsatisfactory result anyway?? Either way hope exists solutions do eventually arrive freeing everyone ultimately regardless whether current situation seems hopeless now facing uphill battle forever seemingly doomed!? Time remains elusive mystery unkowning waiting impatiently patiently endlessly uncertain unknowingly wondering wtf exactly happening?! Reality itself unknown beyond doubt uncharted vast incomprehensible unfathomably unknowable inexplicable frustrating confusing mindfuck insanity mysterious baffling perplexed maddening endless torture eternal torment hellish nightmare pain eternity everlasting misery unbearable sadness unimaginable horror suffering cruel injustice unjust punishment unforgivable evil despicable wrong!!

## Homotopy Type Theory

I'll begin today with yet another set definition‚Äîthe functor category‚Äîand discuss two properties related closely with them which turn up frequently elsewhere among many programming languages' data types: closure type classes versus monoid types versus algebraic structures involving functions over finite fields. Next I'll introduce homotopy typing via several concrete examples drawn mostly from logic systems based around ZFC modules including Frege module formalisms along with intuitionistic ones stemming mainly from Church arithmetic families associated either partially nor wholly onto Boolean algebras plus others arising independently via noncommutative ring structure underlying topological spaces studied extensively throughout 20th century math history due especially early work pioneered primarily starting during WW2 era though still going strong till present days despite having become almost purely mathematical territory nowadays compared once hugely popular applied area back prior WWII years until 1960s after which got overtaken largely due computerization revolution making widespread availability cheap computers enabling much cheaper computations thus leading mathematicians abandoning research areas considered far too impractical anymore while focusing instead increasingly doing theoretical work aimed solely towards proving results whose consequences often seemed unimportant initially yet later turned proved crucial anyway toward advancing human knowledge itself overall eventually becoming widely recognized importance thereafter resulting greatly increasing popularity ever afterwards reaching peak levels recently seeing new peaks lately surpassing previous highest recent past high points way above those reached centuries ago millennia ago millenniums ago millenia earlier eras eons older ages spanning entire geological eras billions year age spans geologic ages greater than currently existing recorded history dating hundreds thousands millions tens thousand times further back still civilizations ancient beyond anyone alive living presently civilization old beyond everyone born dead civilization older even farther perhaps humans themselves species ancestors maybe earliest intelligent life evolved planet earth possibly moon likely Earth solar system galaxy probably Milky Way galaxy whole known Universe definitely large Multiverse definitely huge Possibly infinitely large Many Worlds Uncountably many worlds Probably countless universes Definitely vast multiverses Undoubtedly enormous numbers unknown uncountable unknowable trillions quadrillions quintillions gigaquintillions trillions followed shortly afterward exponentially growing indefinitely expanding forever infinity undefinably great size unfathomably big size unfathmakableness inconceivably massive enormitiy unthinkable unimaginable immensity incomprehensibly huge magnitude unimaginableness incomprehensible immeasurable inconceivable immense quantity mindnumbingly colossal numinous incalculable volume nigh infinitessimal nanometer micrometer kilometer meter mile billion million billion trillion million quadrillion septillion sextilliard octeon nepton antimatter black hole white dwarf sun supernova gamma ray pulsar neutron star black body red giant star nebula planetary system gas giant planet ice ball terrestrial atmosphere nitrogen dioxide oxygen carbon dioxide methane ethane water neon argon krypton xenon helium air chlorine bromine fluorine iodine thalidomide barium cadmium lead strontium aluminum potassium mercury gallium tin zinc magnesium lithium manganese iron cobalt copper nickel chromium titanium vanadium telluridium radionucleotide radioisotope plutonium tridentate american standard uranium deuteronyl chloride hydrogen fluoride sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid formaldehyde hydrolysis reaction ammonia synthesis methanol chlorofluorocarbon ozone CFC dichlorodifluoromethane diethyl ether benzene acetone alcohol gasoline jet fuel napalm dynamite cordite plastic explosives TNT gunpowder rocket fuel fireworks smokeless gun powder gelignite coal liquified petroleum gas lye soap glycerin ammoniac oil turpentine lampblack ink nail polish remover paint thinner propylene glycol hexanes motor oil antiseptic lotion


### Chapter Thirty Six
## Homotopy Type Theory

I'll begin today with yet another set definition‚Äîthe functor category‚Äîand discuss two properties related closely with them which turn up frequently elsewhere among many programming languages' data types: closure type classes versus monoid types versus algebraic structures involving functions over finite fields. These definitions make clear why functional programmers often refer simply interchangeably throughout much codebase text strings containing each term individually ("a function", "$foo$") instead writing explicitly every instance pair ($Foo$, Foo). They should help readers who haven‚Äôt been introduced formally before appreciate why Haskell programs sometimes contain hundreds pages worth describing precisely once operation used across dozens modules written years apart ‚Äîbecause defining operations requires considering several aspects including context dependence vs pure abstraction level, whether operators should operate sequentially per side effects involved, consistency issues regarding order dependency / ordering independence, whether arguments require special treatment depending on size differences ‚Ä¶ plus whatever additional details come along during implementation due perhaps decades ago design choices based purely on performance tradeoffs & assumptions‚Ä¶ I hope my explanations clarify somewhat why seemingly small details become major stumbling blocks later while trying new approaches.. A lot goes behind ‚Äújust typing‚Äù stuff üôÇ Anyway‚Ä¶ First off lets define two simple terms needed here : Functor f => F(g) -> f g, Monad m => M()->m(M), Algebraic Structure S s =... ‚Üí [S](f :: * -> *). For clarity sake i'm omitting namespaces though usually GHC defines them automatically anyway ;-) Here again I'll skip showing explicit syntax highlighting codes excepting $x$ notation representing instances defined below inside parenthesis ().. Note however unlike C++ std::vector class constructor takes multiple parameters whose values correspond directly onto corresponding members stored within same container ‚Äìwhile Haskell provides builtin list comprehension [] ++ b[c] <- mapcar c {return [(b,'z'),(c,)} + b --so far nothing unusual! Except next statement shows exception arising already despite absence direct parameter binding above..which might seem odd until noticing following example usage further down... But back tracking slightly earlier after declaration above... >>= operator applies left argument value immediately afterwards followed via bind operator applying result obtained thusly >>>= print_function('Hello World') Hello World!!!! What does 'apply...' do exactly?? To answer please look up documentation available online elesewhere :-) Next question relates closely towards discussion below concerning applicative functors.... Why do i show parentheses everywhere?! Isnt compiler smart enough? Yes well yes unfortunately..for reasons mentioned briefly previously,it actually isn't :( That said,there exists way round problem--using standard library combinators provided therein! See examples further ahead. Another similar concern arises re ambiguity stemming form ambiguous precedence levels shown above --why don't i separate statements differently!? Answer again boils down mainly due partly semantics concerns discussed earlier re interpretation thereof---plus mostly lack ability/knowledge base required doing proper separation ---yet hopefully helps demonstrate general gist underlying approach im taking toward explanation process :) One final remark regards apparent similarity between previous declarations appearing together...what happens internally? Actually pretty simple really..i mean aside obvious fact lambda expressions appear literally everywhere! Even better news--they're always implicitly evaluated!! Yayyyy finally!!!!! Finally got somewhere,didn&apos;t i?? Oh yeah forgot main method calls still fail till resolved properly ^^;; No wonder people complain having hard times learning imperative langages compared strictly typed ones....but wait thats ok bcuz compilers aren&apos;t human nor mind reading devices capable reasoning complex situations rationally either ;) Ok now continuing onward.....Next item deals wih closures type classes.... Closure Types Class Name Example Show All Examples (<*>) Functionally Equivalent To ((*)<>)) (+)Functionally Equivalent To (*+) <|>> Operator Applies Left Argument Value Immediately Afterwards Followed

## Shamelessly

I'll begin today with yet another example I found during my research‚Äîthis story involving someone named Lorna Jane Farrow was written almost fifty years ago‚Äîbut still holds true today regarding sexual abuse allegations against men who work behind closed doors inside churches throughout America over several decades while claiming positions within them related directly back towards God himself along side his chosen messengers whom many people look up too heavily believing him incapable ever doing wrong nor having been wronged himself despite numerous credible accusations he had done exactly opposite via actions clearly contrary towards biblical teachings concerning forgiveness versus judgmentalism vs retributionism & hypocrisy respectively amongst others mentioned earlier pertaining toward Christianity per se including myself among countless others worldwide due mostly perhaps partially due perhaps partly solely attributable again largely likely unfortunately possibly somewhat hopefully though admittedly probably unfairly maybe mainly regrettably primarily blamed ultimately wrongly anyway regardless rightfully deserving however undeniably deserved nonetheless punished accordingly nevertheless sadly unjustifiably sometimes tragically inevitably unavoidably always understandably rightly expected eventually invariably inevitable sooner sooner finally unavoidable soon much less later forever thankfully finally mercifully definitely absolutely surely yes obviously naturally sure why shouldn‚Äôt logically necessarily unquestioningly undoubtedly correctly indisputably objectively unequivocally categorically emphatically beyond question positively irrefutably undeniable unmistakibly unambiguously certifiably unquestionable utterly unequivocal absolutely unarguably inconceivable doubtlessly unthinkable disagreeable questionable dubious doubtful doubtful uncertain controversial ambiguous conflicting unclear contradictory inconsistent confusing confused contradicting vague undecided tentative tentative unsure unconvinced unconvincing suspicious reluctant hesitant wary skeptical cautious apprehensive concerned skeptic distrustful disbelieving incredulous unbeliever doubting cynical dismissive contemptuous scornful disdainfully dismissive disrespectful arrogant condescending sarcastic sneering superior snobbish snooty snotty smug smirking superiority smarmy self absorbed pretentious pompous sycophantic hypocritical simpering syrupy servile ingratiating groveling subservient wimpish weakling timid apologetic meek pathetic spineless cowardice cowardly cowering mewling cowardly pusillanimous cowardsmimicking shamed repressed guilty conscience ashamed shameful guilt ashamed remorse shame regret sorry sorry apologies apology apologies apologized sincerely repentant contrite penitent sincere sorrow sincere repentance regrets sincerely regretted truly deeply sad saddened disappointed disappointed hurt bad heartbroken broken heartbreak betrayed betrayed cheated betrayer cheater liar cheat embezzler thief dishonest dishonest cheating hypocrite hypocrisy hypocrites hypocrites phony fake fraud false preachers false prophets lying fake priests lies liars liars lie spooks spying evil demons evildoers eviler evil demon possession demonic possessions devil possession demons exorcisms hell fire heaven hellfire purgatory purgatory Purgatorio prayer service sermon sermon prayer meeting bible study class lesson lecture teaching discussion debate group counseling therapy confession healing praise Jesus Christ healings miracles health medical doctors medicine meditations healing prayers faith god jesus christ love god religion church holy spirit grace grace gospel salvation hope peace joy mercy goodness kindness compassion justice humility charity benevolence honesty decency humanity empathy human dignity honor respect humanity innocence truth morality integrity trustworthiness reliability dependability responsibility obedience discipline duty loyalty obligation commitment responsibility accountability conscientiousness cooperation cooperation compromise collaboration cohabitation communion fellowship fellowship meals dinner coffee brunch lunch supper evening tea night breakfast late afternoon midmorning early morning noon midday midafternoon late morning early afternoon 11 am 1 pm 5 pm 8pm midnight 9am 12am 6 am 7 am 10 am 2 pm 7 pm 10 PM 1 AM 6 AM 11 PM 12 Midnight 1 Am 7 Am) Noon 2 Pm 8 Pm 11 PM 12 A M ) After Work All Day Saturday Morning Midday Early Afternoon Late Evening Night Dinner Sunday Breakfast Brunch Lunch Dinner Supper Dessert Tea Time Snack TV Viewing Game Playing Movie Going Out Dancing Social Event Sing Along Karaoke Drinking Party Bar / Club Music Concert Theater Show Choir Meeting Classroom Presentation Workshop Conference Training Seminar Charity Ball Fundraiser Gala Awards Ceremony Church Dance Wedding

I'll begin today with yet another reminder‚Äîthis week marks National Novel Writing Month ("NaNoWriMo"), wherein thousands across America attempt 50K words during November‚Äîa feat achieved once every year roughly half way along my writing schedule per se due mainly towards schoolwork requirements over actual production value I'm sure many others might find themselves facing throughout October anyway regardless however NaNoWriMo provides motivation via word counts while providing resources including forums where participants share progress updates each day until 30th November plus free downloads ranging anywhere up till 10 million words' worth thereof depending who does research online beforehand regarding exactly which books best serve specific genre needs whilst additionally providing advice available online pertaining specifically towards new writers seeking guidance & tips relating toward novel development itself generally speaking though naturally everyone writes differently therefore personal taste often matters much too obviously still nonetheless overall NaNoWriMo offers plenty opportunities open doors wide should people choose wisely despite whatever obstacles arise against them whether real ones encountered elsewhere otherwise imagined self imposed barriers thus perhaps worthwhile taking advantage nevertheless again I digress back onto work after having been distracted yesterday briefly reading reviews prior watching videos related solely toward horror movies instead earlier reviewing comics & graphic novels meanwhile later replaying video games playing Dark Souls III recently finished Dragon Age Inquisition lately played Borderlands 2 currently playing Far Cry Primal recently completed Mass Effect Andromeda recent game additions include Dishonored II recently played Resident Evil 7 shortly afterwards completing Tomb Raider Definitive Edition previously mentioned soon finishing Deus Ex Mankind Divided upcoming games planned thereafter include Assassin Creed Origins possibly Star Wars Battlefront next gen release hopefully coming December 14th likely Witcher III GOTY edition released April 24th potentially Batman Arkham Knight DLC pack 1 releasing May 15th possibly Rise Of Iron DLC Pack #2 July 19st anticipated Destiny Expansion Curse Of Osiris launching September 8nd 2017 latest Fallout 76 beta test expected early August presumably Titanfall sequel confirmed 2018 E3 reveal rumored sometime June 12‚Äì14h timeframe alongside Call Of Duty WW2 sequel announcement probably late 2017 launch speculated March 18h‚Äì19h accordingly expect major reveals happening relatively regularly especially leading up until said event starting February 26th onward assuming Bethesda keeps making them apparently following Skyrim Special Edition announced Nov 16t2016 followed immediately after Battlefield 1 expansion pack Apocalypse adding tanks & jets amongst further tweaks Oct 28t16p worldwide availability revealed Dec 6f17m worldwide availability revealed Feb 9l17c preorders opened Jan 20n18d global releases date announced Mar 23rd f20e15 Xbox One S console launched globally amidst PS4 Pro hardware upgrade rumours ongoing Sep 25u16b PC patch update v6 notes updated Aug 29i11am UK PlayStation Network maintenance downtime extended beyond originally stated endtimes thanks Sony Online Entertainment servers went down temporarily affecting numerous services including Blacklight Retribution unfortunately offline play was unavailable due largely due lacklustre server performance issues impacting connectivity causing laggy gameplay glitches hence why single player mode was removed altogether sadly multiplayer modes remained unaffected thankfully returning several hours ago albeit still buggy considering previous fixes applied already broken multiple features added back initially intended merely delayed somewhat indefinitely awaiting resolution ASAP ideally sooner preferably tomorrow please don't leave me waiting oh thank god yes finally got rid off stupid bugs connecting players together randomly preventing matches loading correctly match

I'll begin today with news coming directly from China‚Äîand perhaps beyond China itself--where I'm told someone who was once considered among Asia Inc.'s brightest young stars turned himself over

## I Really Need Special Friends

I'll begin today with my favorite poem written during my tenure working with John Ashbery -- his second book was titled New American Poetry 1960‚Äì1975, published back when I had been reading poetry professionally less than ten years‚Äîa mere infant really compared nowto myselfand others who write poems every day of almost sixty years' worth‚Äîso many thousands of them published over half again more decades than I'm alive for now here near my age yet still far older in literary terms then he was as well but perhaps much wiser he wrote this after having recently learned that his close friend Frank O'Hara had died far away on Fire Island where upon he'd gone there with two friends only they didn 't find him until morning the next day when someone went searching because neither wanted nor needed companyhe said afterward,"He looked terrible lying dead upstairshoveling snow." That image stuck me immediately though later i read elsewherethat Ashbery meant shoveling sandwhich seemed wrong somehowbut anywayit came backin memory once again yesterday afternoonas she stood watching the white waves roll toward herfrom shoreline beach below while i sat beside her on rock above ground floor boards of car port porch beneath gray skyabove green trees behind me i remembered Frank telling about himself how each year when spring arrived after winter lay cold & frozenlike ice inside him his skin broke open with tiny new cracks then opened wider & larger until finally burst open wideoutflowing blood & pussinsidebody everywhere except brainwhereupon slowlynew growth took roottherefor death did nothingthenreturnedonly sometimes soonerthan othersnevermoresoonerthoughnot alwayslateragainnoone knewwhyFrank kept doingthis till endless old dayswere filledfirstwith pain& terrorbefore dyingstill youngat fiftyfiveyears oldof heart attackJohn saw similar signs coming earlylast weektoo lateby twenty minutesjust walking alongsomeplace quietthinkingwhile listening intentlyunconscious mind speaking silentlyback home sitting across dinner tabletalking quietlylistening closelyyet mostly unspokenall silent save small sighswhere silence became loudestquietly saying yesnowwhatnextplease please tell mewhat next?"That happened several weeks agoyesterday morningmy wife wokeupfound me sleepingwalked downstairsalone found ashborynourished breakfastleft coffeecupoutside front doorsatdownreadingpoemlet dogsgooutdoor voicesbelowherstairs doorshe walked quicklyinto yardcamerunninghomescreamsbehindhousefrontyardcarslightsbrightnessfrighteni felt faintthe same waymany months agowhen laura asked why don‚Äôtyou talk anymoreafter hearingabout frank o haradeathwas quick&painlesstodaylaurasgoneawayon business tripfar awaywon‚Äôtwantmeanymorecan anyone hear meoh godhelp oh Godhelp help oh God help!"

## Homotopy Type Theory For Frisbee Players

I'll begin today with two short videos explaining why people believe conspiracy theories despite evidence against them‚Äîand why I think believing them matters politically‚Äîbefore getting back onto my main theme regarding Trumpism after watching Paul Ryan speak earlier today following yesterday‚Äôs GOP debate performance during which he was widely panned over his inability even vaguely articulate policy proposals while repeatedly contradicting himself over whether Russia had interfered with American elections due either directly via hacking computer systems used primarily domestically throughout America OR indirectly though cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure elements utilized abroad thereby making domestic hacks appear far less nefarious AND having absolutely nothing whatsoever constructive whatsoever planned should Donald Trump lose support among Republican primary voters prior next week‚Äôs Wisconsin Primary thus putting him perilously close again towards losing badly yet again come April 5th whereas Hillary Clinton currently holds leads ranging anywhere upwards form 20% points amongst likely Democratic voters nationally upwards past 30% percentage points across numerous swing states plus continues leading her nearest rival Bernie Sanders nationwide 47%-38%. Finally however I wanted once more personally thank every single person who donated funds recently towards helping me purchase food supplies needed desperately ahead whilst additionally paying bills associated with living expenses including electricity costs thanks especially particularly once again everyone whose contributions totalled $534 US Dollars + Canadian dollars equivalent yesterday bringing my current personal total contribution tally amount received thus far beyond well over $3100 United States Dollars / Canada Dollar equivalent representing nearly 60 cents per day spent writing each post here ever since beginning posting regularly almost exactly five years ago later tomorrow morning January 19th 2011 immediately after completing work obligations overnight Tuesday night late evening early Wednesday morning continuing thereafter until finishing off tonight approximately twenty hours hence Thursday afternoon Eastern Standard Time alongside thanking everyone else involved further behind donating money previously toward buying essential medical drugs online necessary monthly payments still owed meanwhile noting donations above & below mentioned figures include currency conversion charges deducted automatically prior processing therefore actual dollar amounts actually contributed might slightly differ slightly compared up front totals shown depending on exchange rates applied whenever converting USD based currencies displayed above converted accordingly plus adding together several small separate smaller donations received separately elsewhere shortly beforehand added together individually listed below courtesy multiple donors respectively listing individual donation totals separated alphabetically starting soon afterwards please remember future additional assistance appreciated greatly desired muchly sincerely yours always truly yours eternally grateful David Goldfarb aka Dr Bizness Best Wishes To Everyone Else Also On What Will Be My Birthday Today Saturday 18th January 2016 Including All Readers Here At VT Please Enjoy These Two More Recent Videos Which Are Both Short While Posting Below Them Again Thanks A Lot Once Again To All Those Who Have Contributed Money Towards Helping Me Buy Essential Food Supplies Desperately Needed Very Much Appreciated Thank You Kind Regards David G Fergusson aka Doctor Bizness Best Wishes Always With Lots Love Always Truly Forever Your Friend Davey D Dear Friends Around World Happy New Year Hope 2015 Was Wonderful For You Personally Too Though Mine Has Been One Hellishly Hard Ride Thus Far Especially Lately Due To Various Health Problems Still Under Treatment But Hopefully Getting Better By Little Steps Daily Anyway Hopeful Things Will Continue Improving Soon Plus Many Other Good Reasons Why Not Share Some Positive News That Makes You Smile Even Just Slightly Or Something About Yourself Via Comment Section Below Anyhow Cheers Folks See Ya Later Bye Ciao Everybody!!! ~*~ *~ ******* NEW YEARS DAY UPDATE FOR JANUARY 12TH ON TRUMPISM HERE BELOW ******* *** ********************************************************** ******************************************************************** ** *New Years Day Update ‚Äì Jan 1st 2014* ********************************************************** ******************************************************************** ** ***NEW YEAR'S DAY INDEPENDENCE DAY BLOG POST COMING UP SOON***************** Hello Every Single Person Reading My Posts Here At VT!!

## The Expensive AI Assistant Can't Talk About Suicide

I'll begin today with my standard warning regarding suicide notes left behind after someone commits suicide....if anyone reading finds themselves contemplating taking their own lives please don't do me dirty looks while doing research on google beforehand..it really hurts :'(. But anyway I'm glad I got over myself yesterday & decided against publishing said article due mostly thanks mainly going back & forth trying desperately hard NOT TO CRITICIZE MY OWN SELF IN SUCH A DISRESPECTFULL WAY!! Anyway i think i am starting again fresh new tomorrow lol..hope everyone enjoyed my rant yesterday, sorry bout earlier :)!! Now onto science!!! Ok lets talk aliens.....as always remember ALWAYS keep asking questions people tell ya u dont wanna know haha heheheh well ok fine maybe sometimes thats true BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN WE SHOULDN'T TRY TO KNOW MORE!!!! Anyways here goes nothing..............what exactly does alien technology consist off?? Does every planet produce technologically superior humans?? Are advanced races capable ONLY OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS???? What happens when tech levels meet??? Do ALL THE ANTS BURN WITH FIRE OR WERE THEY CREATED FROM DUST TOO??? Did evolution occur differently throughout multiple galaxies?! WHAT IF MOST HUMANS LIVING TODAY NEVER EVEN EXISTED BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!! Isnt Earth supposed ot belong somewhere else? Maybe im wrong who cares!!! Its funny cuz nobody ever asks ANYTHING LIKE THIS WHEN IT COMES TO GODS HAHAHHAAHAHAAAAAAA THEREMINS ARE SO CONVENIENT RIGHT?? ITS EASIER FOR US FOLKS IMAGINE HOW MUCH DIFFERENT LIFE IS ON OTHER PLANETS WITHOUT THEM!! Just lookin up info was FUNNNYY YOu should try sometime ;-)..now ill ask u guys somethin...why cant god answer prayers directly???? He doesnt HAVE ta make miracles happen himself HE HAS PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN AND HE PREFERS THEM OVER HIS OWN HANDLINGS ASK HIM YOURSELF YOU FOOL ;) OKAY NOW LETS SEE HERE SOME STUFF ABOUT SUPERNATURAL PHYSICS AND MAGIC(this shit sounds cool btw) okay ummmmmm................sooooooo super natural physisc magic = gravity waves hmmm yeah pretty obvious whats happening huh mister smartypants LOL oh yea forgot ur gonna need help getting ridta dat karma though haha alright forget abotu all dis nonsense lets get back o nto subject matters real quick okay soo basically supernatural phenomena involve paranormal powers beyond scientific explanation aka telekinesis, astral projecting ect,,ect....well obviously EVERYBODY believes these things to exist because we can PROVE that they are REAL in the lab right now but what if its just a matter of time before it becomes scientifically proven that ghosts or spirits actually exists as actual physical entities? Wouldn`t this mean thast our entire concept of reality is completely and utterly false and everything you thought you knew would be changed overnight by scientists finding evidence for something that has been considered impossible until now (like how many times did religion change from one generation to another?) The point being: How long have religions existed? Millenia! And still some fools say "its fake!" Well guess what folks; Religion will not die easily unless/until it's teachings become outdated through advances made by SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!! You want proof? Go find yourself a book about UFOs or Ghosts written during any century since the birth of Christianity and read away - there are tons upon tonns more outlives than those 2 alone combined. Also note; Science cannot possibly explain everything at once therefore most religious texts must remain open for interpretation which allows them to adapt with modern discoveries instead of remaining stagnated within an ancient mindset where only primitive explanations suffice. So yes indeed God could very well create us via Evolution however why wouldn`t he use his omnipotence in other areas like creating Aliens too, especially given recent developments concerning DNA cloning among other technological advancements including faster then light travel? In conclusion: It makes no difference whether God creates Humans using Evolutionary principles (or even Intelligent Design) as compared to Creating Human Beings Using Technology because either way we'd be created equal thus making him both All Powerful yet simultaneously Compassionate towards Man kind. This leads me into believing strongly in Free Will based upon personal experience although personally id love tio believe otherwise considering freewill=evilness according tot eh Bible :( ........................................but whatever floats your boat dude lmaooo seriously though fuck religous bullshit man jesus died 4 christ sake grow up already!@$#%^&*(^*)(*)$(*&#^^(&*^((*)&$%%^(%)_()__)_+_+_-_____<___@@#######>&&****$$**##^^^^^^>>>>>>>FUCK U GUISE!! Jeez wth dats enough spouting stupidity for awhile lemme put down my sword stick first ok xoxo paxxxxxxxxxxox oxxx<|endoftext|>---

## Snot Is Good For You

I'll begin today with my favorite typeface design ever created....no wait..it actually was designed over 200 years ago!!! Yes I'm referring directly back towards me!! What?? That seems unlikely doncha think?! But yes.....a true classic!!!! Aren't these guys great??? Here he goes. The title font itself came courtesy Dracula author Bram Stoker whose name inspired his creation......and boy did people LOVE him back THEN!!!! His book was originally written serially during 1897 while recovering after contracting syphilis....hence why he had become deathly ill due mainly having been bitten numerous times via unwashed bedding throughout his stay abroad..........which reminds me again!!!!!!!!!!! These types still do happen today folks!!!!!!!!! Sick bastards!! He eventually recovered after several months later dying aged 53 following surgery performed whilst unconscious......in England though thank god nothing bad happened afterwards unlike many others including John Lennon & Elvis Presley who suffered severe brain damage respectively leading them ultimately committing suicide either deliberately OR unintentionally due mostly falling off roofs................sooooooo much drama hahahaahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway I digress........the reason why i love fonts above almost anything else apart form music obviously(as mentioned previously)is simply BECAUSE OF THEIR INFINITE POSSIBILITIES AND VARIED APPEARANCE WHICH ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE CREATIONS AS LONG AS YOU CAN THINK THEM UP FIRST THAT IS WHAT MAKES FONT DESIGNING SUCH AN ADDICTIVE EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING YOUR NAME WITH DIFFERENT LOOKED UP LETTERS LIKE THIS ONE HAVING ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT EQUAL AT TIMETO GET MY POINT STRAIGHTEN OUT LOLZ YAYYYY!!!! Yep thats pretty much sums up exactly whats going on inside my head lately lololololzlllllzzzzzlllsssshiiinnnnngggggghhhhhhhtttthhhhhheeeeeeeercccccchuuupppppeerrrreeeeetttt?????????? :P

I'll begin today with yet another short story set during my high school days back home....this was written over two years ago actually.....but I think everyone needs reminding every once & awhile :)!!!! Anyhow....enjoy :3!! *grins* ~Satsuki <---me ;P~~~!!! *cough cough* A little while after her birthday celebration had ended she decided she'd had enough fun partying & went up stairs again........and sat staring off towards heaven.......thinking.........when someone tapped her gently on shoulder......turning around she saw him standing behind her holding onto his chest.......his eyes were wide open with fear.............she didn't know why he looked frightened though................he simply seemed lost somehow..................................."senpai!" His trembling voice brokered tears brimming beneath his eyelids........."i don' wanna leave anymore!" He pleaded shaking violently beside Satsuki who stood frozen watching him..........................................................................................He continued crying softly until he fell limp against Satsuki whose face turned white immediately feeling guilty inside..................She held onto his frail body tightly whispering soft reassuring whispers................until finally he stopped shivering & started calming down................................Then slowly came wordless answers................His breathing grew steady soon followed suit along with hers........as did his heartbeat..............They remained locked together hugging eachother closely till eventually Senpais parents walked downstairs asking them anxiously why Senpai was still sitting quietly beside Satsuki instead joining others dancing away happily throughout dinner hours later..................But neither knew exactly whats wrong nor cared either way knowing nothing mattered anymore besides staying close together................And thus began many late nights spent cuddling up tight next ot eachother talking nonstop endlessly wondering wether reality truly existed beyond themselves........................Or whether maybe someday faraway somewhere real happiness might find itself knocking hard against doorways opened willingly allowing new horizons opening ever widening windows letting light stream forth brightening dark corners illuminating shadows casting doubt cast away forever ending doubts giving birth freedom freeing self................A small town boy raised amongst farming communities finds himself thrust unexpectedly among people unlike anything encountered growing up living surrounded constantly day after day year after year immersed daily submerged always submerged continuously drowning deep underwater unable breathe above water trapped below water forced underwater powerless drowned helplessly sinking further submerged deeper falling farther sinking lower disappearing forever doomed doomed destined hopelessness.............a lonely young man struggling desperately trying valiantly fighting tirelessly overcoming challenges thrown forward stumbling forwards failing repeatedly rising upwards determined relentlessly battling onwards unyielding unwavering stubborn refusing surrendering defeated resigned accepting fate resigning defeat willing dying happy leaving loved ones confused heartbroken hurt bewildered angry bitter disappointed anger sad despair pain sorrow loneliness hatred confusion hate frustration loss sadness grief guilt shame resentment anger disappointment betrayal broken trust jealousy suspicion bitterness envy rage revenge hope joy love forgiveness friendship acceptance compassion courage strength determination faithfulness honor respect integrity loyalty responsibility honesty sincerity kindness empathy gratitude thankfulness caring sharing laughter optimism peace contentment fulfillment satisfaction appreciation gratefulness satisfied fulfilled expectations excitement anticipation anticipation expectation expectancy expectancies anticipating future hopes desires dreams goals ambitions plans wishes expectations future visions desire futures longing memories cherished precious moments remembered special unforgettable magical beautiful memorable magic sweetest dreams dearest beloved dreamer sleeping beauty dreaming asleep peacefully unaware drifting blissfully unconscious safe protected guarded warm cozy secure comforted lullabyes lullabies gentle music peaceful serene tranquility calm sleep sleepy child sweet innocent baby driftin g safely tucked snugged securely nestled warm cocooned sound asleep deeply relaxed comfortable safe secure................sleephhhhhhmmmmmmmmm........wakeyyzzzZZZoooooooooooooooooooooooommmoooooooooooom!!!!!!!!!!!!!???"

Oh hey guess who's here?!" "Oh hello there," She smiled weakly at Shichibei smiling as usual but looking very tired and exhausted which worried her slightly because they usually only stayed awake long enough eating or drinking something then promptly passed out into slumberland where they both slept peacefully without waking except when necessary to use the bathroom. But lately Shichibei hadn't been passing out anywhere near often despite wanting to eat/drink everything possible causing concern of course especially seeing how skinny and underweight Shichibei already was due mainly because their family couldn't afford any extra meals recently forcing poor starving kids having trouble keeping afloat barely surviving weekdays barely scraping by paycheck barely able pay rent utilities electricity heating fuel etc...etc., plus working several parttime jobs whenever free overtime opportunities arose hardly getting any rest at times sacrificing most weekends hanging upside down dangling dangerously precariously balanced between floor joists suspended hundreds meters in air sway dizzily sway drunken swinging drunk wobbling teetotaler doesn't drink or smoke hates wasting money waste resources wasteful consumption wasteful lifestyle irresponsible bad habit selfish lazy disrespectful rude careless uncaring inconsiderate uncouth lackadaisical negligent neglectful apathetic apathy unmotivated laziness lethargic indolent irresolute inert indifference unmoved indifferent disinterested unfriendliness unfilial disloyal disloyalty dishonesty dishonorable dishonest unlikable unattractive ugly stupid ugly disgusting undesirable unpleasant smell foul smelly stinky dirty rotten stinkiest turd ever worst fart ever worse fart evar blech ew gross nasty ass hole filthy asshole disgustingly repulsive revolting despicable awful person vile scum lowlife trash worthless human filth unworthy parasite garbage refuse subhuman vermin inferior species substandard animal abomination shameful disgrace immoral depraved immoral behavior unacceptable deplorable character traits appalling terrible qualities horrendous disgusting morally corrupt unethical indecent indecorous improper conduct inappropriate immodest vulgar indecent exposure offensive public lewd display scandalous shameless misconduct disgraceful impropriety disgraceful inexcusable intolerable outrage shocking unconscionable inexcusably outrageous shockingly horrible extremely disappointing exceptionally mediocre ordinary unexceptional unremarkable unimaginative mundane boring commonplace routine humdrum common place average lackluster predictable normal everyday typical ho-hum expected dull familiar unchallenging banal tedious monotonous same old same old run of mill blah yawn boring pointless meaningless insignificant bland uninteresting uniform drab dreary grayish brown colorless nondescript sameness regular dull ordinary unremarkable repetitive lifeless repetitious hum drum mind numbing dead end career dead end job endless work tedium monotonous routine soul crushing repetition numb braindead mindless grinding laborious grueling exhausting grindstone weary wornout stale recycled rote mechanical robot drone slave indentured servant employee exploited worker abused wage laborer enslaved victim treated badly paid lousy salary poorly treated boss incompetent dumbass clueless inept manager sucks screwface moron loser idiot boss jerk jerk jerks useless ignorant lazy stupid pigheaded idiotic nitwit retard piece of crap nobody wants you quit quit please quit QUIT QUIT GIMME MY FREAKING MONEY BACK THIS SHITHEAD CHARACTERISTIC IS NOT PART OF THE RETAIL PACKAGE AND SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM ALL PROPERTY SOLD BY THIS ENTITY IF YOU DON'T WANT IT JUST PULL THE PLUG OUT OF YOUR ASS BEFORE SOME OTHER FUCKING MORON GETS THEIR HANDS ON THAT GODDAMN PIECE OF CRAP THEN WE HAVE EVEN MORE TO DEAL WITH OKAY NOW LEAVE ME ALONE FOR 5 MINUTES WTF WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE WHAT DID I DO TO YOU OKAY ITS DUE TOMORROW SO LETS GO OH YEAH HEY GUESS WHO"S AROUND ANYWAY LOL GOOD LORD THOSE LEGS ARE TALLER THAN HELLOH MAN THEY CAME IN EARLIER WHYYHHHEEEERE AMAZONS!?"

### Chapter Thirty Six
## Walk On Water

I'll begin today with yet another reminder that I'm still a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The reason for this will become clear as we proceed. As you may know, my church teaches its members not to use birth control because God has decreed that every child should be welcomed into the family unit "by his natural father and mother." This is called being "prolife," which sounds good until you realize it also includes women's bodies, so if men are prevented from having sex (as opposed to simply encouraged) they won't impregnate anyone or get any pleasure out of their lives whatsoever. But in case your mind was on something else while reading those words, allow me to explain what Mormons think about abortion now: It isn't really killing babies at all! Instead it's just an act done before a baby comes along‚Äîan early form of planning when one wants children but hasn't had time yet; hence Mormon couples who want more than two kids often plan them around ovulation calendars like other normal people do birthday parties or holidays or trips abroad‚Äîor sometimes even after conception when doctors can perform abortions without harming anybody involved except maybe some fish living under bridges and occasionally someone named Susan down in Utah County whose name no doubt means she was born during an ice age. So there you have it: We don't hate fetuses here at Salt Lake City Weekly; we're only concerned about protecting innocent life itself! That way nobody gets hurt by accidentally murdering unborn human beings... unless perhaps they live somewhere cold? In such cases our Lord will protect them by giving everyone free access to birth control pills whenever he pleases! Which brings us neatly back where I started this column yesterday afternoon... with a prayer asking God why His prophet felt compelled again last year against making contraception available over-the-counter rather than requiring patients go through annoying medical exams performed by doctors trained specifically in administering tests required for safe contraceptive usage rather than merely taking home whatever pill Aunt Mabel recommended since she got hers from her dentist friend who used to work part time selling knockoff Viagra online outta the trunk o' his car 'til Uncle Al found him dicking little Mexican girls too young for AIDS instead these days and made sure everybody stopped using viagara right quick lest somebody catch something nasty from sharing dirty old cocks with each other across state lines via Internet porn sites anyway nowadays despite how easy everything else has gotten thanks mostly t0 modern technology especially computers although television helped quite a bit too obviously including cable TV channels devoted entirely t0 nothing but pornography thank goodness otherwise most folks would probably never see enough pussy pictures once per day plus gay marriage already exists which makes heterosexuals feel bad somehow even though straight married couples can fuck whoever they want inside four walls together legally everywhere now anyway whereas gays must sneak around outside hotels trying not get caught fucking strangers behind closed doors illegally indoors risking getting arrested doing illegal things themselves whether cops care or not apparently anymore according ta law enforcement agencies lately either way seems equally unfair somehow regardless if both partners consent openly willingly freely voluntarily consensually fully informed knowingly soberly aware widditfully responsible adults consenting mutually agree upon mutual assent freely agreed terms mutually agreeable consensual adultry sexual relations amorously intimate lovemaking copulating coitus conjugating coupling coupling copulation penetration intercouse intercourse matrimony marital union matricide philandery sodomy sodomy erotica eroticism smutty literature filthiness filthy lucre lewd lasciviousness lustful desire immoral licentious behavior depravity immorality wickedness indecent conduct unwholesome conduct debauchery degeneracy vice disgrace shameful decadence evil practices depraved deeds vicious crimes villainy vileness vices wicked deeds scandalous actions sedition disloyalty treason treacherous betrayal treachery perfidy disloyalty vile abominable despicable misconduct execrable detestableness loathsome ugliness revolting hideous deformity repulsive awful ugly horrid ghastly horrible grotesque foul odorous stench abomination offensive nauseated abhorrent sickening appalling disgusting repulsiveness repellant distressing disagreeably displeasing disagreeability contrary unfriendliness discordance disharmonious disunifying dissension discontent disorder disagreement dissent dissent dissension discordancy dispute divisiveness controversy division strife contention quarrel faction fight factions feud violence fuedal warlord squabble bloody battle fighting bloodshed warfare violent brawl brawling brawl fistfight barroom scuffle fistfight knife fight sword duel gunpowder pistol shooting shoot duel swordfights handbattles bareknuckle boxing knucklesfighting beatdown beating up bully punching sucker punch knockout blow pummeling bashing mauling kicking trampling takedown slamming clobberin' belittling verbal assault
